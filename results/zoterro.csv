Many new confounder selection methods have been developed since then. The goal of the study was to provide an updated descriptive portrait of which variable selection methods are used by epidemiologists for analyzing observational data. Studies published in four major epidemiological journals in 2015 were reviewed. Only articles concerned with a predictive or explicative objective and reporting on the analysis of individual data were included. Method(s) employed for selecting variables were extracted from retained articles. A total of 975 articles were retrieved and 299 met eligibility criteria, 292 of which pursued an explicative objective. Among those, 146 studies (50%) reported using prior knowledge or causal graphs for selecting variables, 34 (12%) used change in effect estimate methods, 26 (9%) used stepwise approaches, 16 (5%) employed univariate analyses, 5 (2%) used various other methods and 107 (37%) did not provide sufficient details to allow classification (more than one method could be employed in a single article). Despite being less frequent than in the previous review, stepwise and univariable analyses, which are susceptible to introduce bias and produce inadequate inferences, were still prevalent. Moreover, 37% studies did not provide sufficient details to assess how variables were selected. We thus believe there is still room for improvement in variable selection methods used by epidemiologists and in their reporting.","2019","2023-10-24 12:28:08","2023-10-24 12:31:32","","725-730","","","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Study Design and Setting Original observational studies with a predictive or explicative research question with multivariable analyses published in N. Engl. J. Med., Lancet, JAMA, Br. Med. J. and Ann. Intern. Med. between 2017 and 2019 were searched. Article screening was performed by a single reader, data extraction was performed by two readers and a third reader participated in case of disagreement. The use of data-driven variable selection methods in causal explicative questions was considered as misuse. Results 488 articles were included. The variable selection method was unclear in 234 (48%) articles, data-driven in 78 (16%) articles and knowledge-based in 176 (36%) articles. The most common data-driven methods were: Univariate selection (n = 22, 4.5%) and model comparisons or testing for interaction (n = 17, 3.5%). Data-driven methods were misused in 51 (10.5%) of articles. Conclusion Overall reporting of variable selection methods is insufficient.

When a “Confounder” Is Only Measured After Exposure","Epidemiology","","","10.1097/EDE.0000000000001312","","Advice regarding the analysis of observational studies of exposure effects usually is against adjustment for factors that occur after the exposure, as they may be caused by the exposure (or medi- ate the effect of exposure on outcome), so potentially leading to col- lider stratification bias. However, such factors could also be caused by unmeasured confounding factors, in which case adjusting for them will also remove some of the bias due to confounding. We derive expres- sions for collider stratification bias when conditioning and confound- ing bias when not conditioning on the mediator, in the presence of unmeasured confounding (assuming that all associations are linear and there are no interactions). Using simulations, we show that generally neither the conditioned nor the unconditioned estimate is unbiased, and the trade-off between them depends on the magnitude of the effect of the exposure that is mediated relative to the effect of the unmeasured confounders and their relations with the mediator. We illustrate the use of the bias expressions via three examples: neuroticism and mortality (adjusting for the mediator appears the least biased option), glycated hemoglobin levels and systolic blood pressure (adjusting gives smaller bias), and literacy in primary school pupils (not adjusting gives smaller bias). Our formulae and simulations can inform quantitative bias anal- ysis as well as analysis strategies for observational studies in which there is a potential for unmeasured confounding.","2021-03","2023-10-24 12:34:54","2023-11-14 14:59:14","","","","2","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The focus is on regularized regressions identified through a systematic review of the lit- erature, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. A total of 14 methods are discussed, most of which use penalty terms to perform group variable selection. Depending on how the methods account for the group structure, they can be classified into knowl- edge and data-driven approaches. The first encompass group-level and bi-level selection methods, while two-step approaches and collinearity-tolerant meth- ods constitute the second category. The identified methods are briefly explained and their performance compared in a simulation study. This comparison demon- strated that group-level selection methods, such as the group minimax concave penalty, are superior to other methods in selecting relevant variable groups but are inferior in identifying important individual variables in scenarios where not all variables in the groups are predictive. This can be better achieved by bi-level selection methods such as group bridge. Two-step and collinearity-tolerant approaches such as elastic net and ordered homogeneity pursuit least absolute shrinkage and selection operator are inferior to knowledge-driven methods but provide results without requiring prior knowledge. Possible applications in proteomics are considered, leading to suggestions on which method to use depending on existing prior knowledge and research question.","2023","2023-10-24 12:37:50","2023-10-24 12:39:29","","331-352","","","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Optimising vaccination strategies is essential to reduce the disease burden in this vulnerable population. We therefore compared the effectiveness of two- and three-dose schedules involving AZD1222 (AZ; ChAdOx1-S) and BNT162b2 (BNT) among people with kidney disease in England. Methods With the approval of NHS England, we performed a retrospective cohort study among people with moderate-to-severe kidney disease. Using linked primary care and UK Renal Registry records in the OpenSAFELY- TPP platform, we identified adults with stage 3–5 chronic kidney disease, dialysis recipients, and kidney transplant recipients. We used Cox proportional hazards models to compare COVID-19-related outcomes and non-COVID-19 death after two-dose (AZ–AZ vs BNT–BNT) and three-dose (AZ–AZ–BNT vs BNT–BNT–BNT) schedules. Findings After two doses, incidence during the Delta wave was higher in AZ–AZ (n = 257,580) than BNT–BNT recipients (n = 169,205; adjusted hazard ratios [95% CIs] 1.43 [1.37–1.50], 1.59 [1.43–1.77], 1.44 [1.12–1.85], and 1.09 [1.02–1.17] for SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19-related hospitalisation, COVID-19-related death, and non- COVID-19 death, respectively). Findings were consistent across disease subgroups, including dialysis and transplant recipients. After three doses, there was little evidence of differences between AZ–AZ–BNT (n = 220,330) and BNT–BNT–BNT recipients (n = 157,065) for any outcome during a period of Omicron dominance. Interpretation Among individuals with moderate-to-severe kidney disease, two doses of BNT conferred stronger protection than AZ against SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease. A subsequent BNT dose levelled the playing field, emphasising the value of heterologous RNA doses in vulnerable populations.

Simulation studies should be designed to include some settings in which answers are already known. They should be coded in stages, with data-generating mechanisms checked before simulated data are analysed. Results should be explored carefully, with scatterplots of standard error estimates against point estimates surprisingly powerful tools. Failed estimation and outlying estimates should be identified and dealt with by changing data-generating mechanisms or coding realistic hybrid analysis procedures.

We show that, beyond the first 30 d after infection, individuals with COVID-19 are at increased risk of incident cardiovascular disease spanning several categories, including cerebrovascular disorders, dysrhythmias, ischemic and non-ischemic heart disease, pericarditis, myocarditis, heart failure and thromboembolic disease. These risks and burdens were evident even among individuals who were not hospitalized during the acute phase of the infection and increased in a graded fashion according to the care setting during the acute phase (non-hospitalized, hospitalized and admitted to intensive care). Our results provide evidence that the risk and 1-year burden of cardiovascular disease in survivors of acute COVID-19 are substantial.

These recommendations are derived from small observational studies that usually included only patients with severe COVID-19 who were admitted to intensive care. We emulated a hypothetical clinical trial to estimate the effect of early initiation of thromboprophylaxis compared with no thromboprophylaxis on mortality risk among hospitalised COVID-19 patients managed with ward-based care. Methods Data were obtained from 5 collaborating centres using the NIHR COVID-19 cardiovascular dataset. Eligible patients (≥18 years) were hospitalised for COVID-19 between January and October 2020. We used a window of 24 hours from admission to define the treatment strategy (prophylactic dose versus no dose), taking the first dose assigned within this window. The prophylactic dose for dalteparin, enoxaparin, heparin, and tinzaparin were considered. Those that received invasive ventilation or other anti-coagulant medications or doses were excluded. Propensity scores (PS; patients’ estimated probability of receiving thromboprophylaxis) were derived using multivariable logistic regression; patients with high prob- abilities of either treatment strategy were excluded. Follow-up started 24 hours following admission. Patients who died within 24 hours of hospital admission without receiving thromboprophylaxis were assigned to a treatment group based on their PS, to mitigate immortal time bias. We estimated mortality hazard ratios comparing a prophylactic dose versus no dose, adjusting for confounders and additionally adjusting for the PS. In a sensitivity analysis, we started treatment at admission with early deaths assigned to treatment based on the PS. We performed subgroup analyses based on comorbid- ities and age groups. Results Of 4262 COVID-19 patients that received ward-based care, 3434 without an extreme PS were included (46% female, median age 64 years (interquartile range (IQR) 50- 79)). The median follow-up was 183 days (IQR 114-266). 1780 received a prophylactic dose and 1654 received no dose. 62 participants died within the first 24 hours of their admission. There was an estimated 10% lower mortality risk for patients treated with a prophylactic dose versus those without, although the difference was not significant: hazard ratio 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.77-1.05)) (Figure 1). The hazard ratio attenuated during sensitivity analysis: 0.99 (0.79-1.25). In subgroup analyses, there was a mortality bene- fit associated with thromboprophylaxis for COVID-19 patients who had a pneumonia (n=337) (0.42 (0.18-0.96)). Conclusion There was no strong evidence that initiation of heparin based thromboprophylaxis compared with no throm- boprophylaxis within 24 hours of admission was associated with a lower mortality risk in COVID-19 patients receiving ward-based care. However, a mortality benefit was associated with thromboprophylaxis amongst COVID-19 patients who had pneumonia that was mild enough to not require intubation.

To maximise the potential of Germ Defence to effectively reduce the spread of COVID-19 the intervention needed to be implemented at scale rapidly. Methods: With the approval of NHS England, we implemented an ecient two-arm (1:1 ratio) cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) to examine the effectiveness of randomising implementation of Germ Defence via GP practices across England, UK, compared with usual care. GP practices randomised to the intervention arm (n=3292) were emailed and asked to disseminate the Germ Defence intervention to all adult patients via mobile phone text, email or social media. GP practices randomised to the usual care arm (n=3287) maintained standard management for the 4-month trial period after and then asked to share Germ Defence with their adult patients. The primary outcome was the rate of GP presentations for respiratory tract infections (RTI) per patient. Secondary outcomes comprised rates of acute RTIs, conrmed COVID-19 diagnoses, suspected COVID-19 diagnoses, COVID-19 symptoms, gastrointestinal infection diagnoses, antibiotic usage, hospital admissions. The impact of the intervention on outcome rates was assessed using negative binomial regression modelling within the OpenSAFELY platform. The uptake of intervention by GP practice, and by patients were measured via website analytics. Results: Germ Defence was used 310,731 times. The average satisfaction score after using the website was 7.52 (0-10 not at all to very satised, N = 9933). There was no evidence of a difference in the rate of RTIs between intervention and control practices (rate ratio (RR) 1.01, 95%CI 0.96, 1.06, p=0.70). This was similar to all other eight health outcomes. Patient engagement within intervention arm practices ranged from 0- 48% of a practice list. Practices with high levels of intervention uptake (>11%) had a lower proportion of minority ethnic groups. Conclusions: We demonstrated that rapid large-scale implementation of a digital behavioural intervention can be evaluated with a novel ecient prospective RCT methodology analysing routinely collected patient data entirely within a trusted research environment. Trial registration: This trial was registered in the ISRCTN registry (14602359) on 12 August 2020","","2023-10-24 13:09:03","2023-10-24 13:11:28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We dened a ‘pre-vaccination’ cohort (18,210,937 people) in the wild-type/Alpha variant eras (January 2020-June 2021), and ‘vaccinated’ and ‘unvaccinated’ cohorts (13,572,399 and 3,161,485 people respectively) in the Delta variant era (June-December 2021). The incidence of each arterial thrombotic, venous thrombotic and other cardiovascular outcomes was substantially elevated during weeks 1-4 after COVID-19, compared with before or without COVID-19, but less markedly elevated in time periods beyond week 4. Hazard ratios were higher after hospitalized than non-hospitalized COVID-19 and higher in the pre-vaccination and unvaccinated than the vaccinated cohort. COVID-19 vaccination reduces the risk of cardiovascular events after COVID-19 infection.

Recent theoretical and methodological developments have helped clarify a number of principles of confounder selection. When complete knowledge of a causal diagram relating all covariates to each other is available, graphical rules can be used to make deci- sions about covariate control. Unfortunately, such complete knowledge is often unavailable. This paper puts forward a prac- tical approach to confounder selection decisions when the somewhat less stringent assumption is made that knowledge is available for each covariate whether it is a cause of the exposure, and whether it is a cause of the outcome. Based on recent theoretically justified developments in the causal inference literature, the following proposal is made for covariate control decisions: control for each covariate that is a cause of the exposure, or of the outcome, or of both; exclude from this set any variable known to be an instrumental variable; and include as a covariate any proxy for an unmeasured variable that is a common cause of both the exposure and the outcome. Various principles of confounder selection are then further related to statistical covariate selection methods.","2019","2023-10-24 13:19:06","2023-10-24 13:22:04","","211-219","","","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

How- ever, adjusting for all observed baseline covariates, when only a subset are confounders of the effect of interest, is known to yield potentially inefficient and unstable estimators of the treatment effect. Furthermore, it raises the risk of finite-sample bias and bias due to model misspecification. For these stated reasons, confounder (or covariate) selection is commonly used to determine a subset of the available covariates that is sufficient for confounding adjustment. In this article, we propose a confounder selection strategy that focuses on sta- ble estimation of the treatment effect. In particular, when the propensity score (PS) model already includes covariates that are sufficient to adjust for confound- ing, then the addition of covariates that are associated with either treatment or outcome alone, but not both, should not systematically change the effect esti- mator. The proposal, therefore, entails first prioritizing covariates for inclusion in the PS model, then using a change-in-estimate approach to select the smallest adjustment set that yields a stable effect estimate. The ability of the proposal to correctly select confounders, and to ensure valid inference of the treatment effect following data-driven covariate selection, is assessed empirically and compared with existing methods using simulation studies. We demonstrate the proce- dure using three different publicly available datasets commonly used for causal inference.","2020","2023-10-24 13:22:05","2023-10-24 13:25:37","","607-630","","3","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Forbes","Introduction to causal diagrams for confounder selection","Respirology","","","https://doi.org/10.1111/resp.12238","","In respiratory health research, interest often lies in estimating the effect of an exposure on a health outcome. If randomization of the exposure of interest is not possible, estimating its effect is typically complicated by confounding bias. This can often be dealt with by controlling for the variables causing the confounding, if measured, in the statistical analysis. Common statistical methods used to achieve this include multivariable regression models adjusting for selected confounding variables or stratification on those variables. Therefore, a key question is which measured variables need to be controlled for in order to remove confounding. An approach to confounder-selection based on the use of causal diagrams (often called directed acyclic graphs) is discussed. A causal diagram is a visual representation of the causal relationships believed to exist between the variables of interest, including the exposure, outcome and potential confounding variables. After creating a causal diagram for the research question, an intuitive and easy-to-use set of rules can be applied, based on a foundation of rigorous mathematics, to decide which measured variables must be controlled for in the statistical analysis in order to remove confounding, to the extent that is possible using the available data. This approach is illustrated by constructing a causal diagram for the research question: ‘Does personal smoking affect the risk of subsequent asthma?’. Using data taken from the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study, the statistical analysis suggested by the causal diagram approach was performed.","2014","2023-10-24 13:26:17","2023-10-24 13:27:23","","303-311","","3","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High-dimensional data arise through a combination of two phenomena. First, the data may be inherently high dimensional in that many different characteristics per observation are available. For example, the US Census collects information on hundreds of individual characteristics and scanner datasets record transaction-level data for households across a wide range of products. Second, even when the number of available variables is relatively small, researchers rarely know the exact functional form with which the small number of variables enter the model of interest. Researchers are thus faced with a large set of potential variables formed by different ways of interacting and transforming the underlying variables. This paper provides an overview of how innovations in ""data mining"" can be adapted and modified to provide high-quality inference about model parameters. Note that we use the term ""data mining"" in a modern sense which denotes a principled search for ""true"" predictive power that guards against false discovery and overfitting, does not erroneously equate in-sample fit to out-of-sample predictive ability, and accurately accounts for using the same data to examine many different hypotheses or models.","2014","2023-10-30 17:49:12","2023-10-30 17:52:10","","29-50","","2","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose an interactive procedure for con- founder selection that does not require pre-specifying the graph or the set of observed variables. This procedure iteratively expands the causal graph by finding what we call “primary adjustment sets” for a pair of possibly confounded variables. This can be viewed as inverting a sequence of latent projec- tions of the underlying causal graph. Structural information in the form of primary adjustment sets is elicited from the user, bit by bit, until either a set of covariates are found to control for confounding or it can be determined that no such set exists. Other information, such as the causal relations between confounders, is not required by the procedure. We show that if the user correctly specifies the primary adjustment sets in every step, our procedure is both sound and complete.","2023-10","2023-10-31 16:17:45","2024-01-29 15:05:06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underlie all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: those about (1) the effects of potential interventions (2) probabilities of counterfactuals, and (3) direct and indirect effects (also known as “mediation”). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both. The tools are demonstrated in the analyses of mediation, causes of effects, and probabilities of causation.","2010","2023-11-14 14:04:33","2023-11-14 14:10:12","","","","2","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although confounder identification strategies that combine empirical and theoretical strategies have been proposed, the need for adjustment remains unclear if the empirical and theoretical criteria yield contradictory results due to random error. We simulated several scenarios to mimic either the presence or the absence of a confounding effect and tested the accuracy of the exposure-outcome association estimates with and without adjustment. Various criteria (significance criterion, Change-in-estimate(CIE) criterion with a 10% cutoff and with a simulated cutoff) were imposed, and a range of sample sizes were trialed. In the presence of a true confounding effect, unbiased estimates were obtained only by using the CIE criterion with a simulated cutoff. In the absence of a confounding effect, all criteria performed well regardless of adjustment. When the confounding factor was affected by both exposure and outcome, all criteria yielded accurate estimates without adjustment, but the adjusted estimates were biased. To conclude, theoretical confounders should be adjusted for regardless of the empirical evidence found. The adjustment for factors that do not have a confounding effect minimally effects. Potential confounders affected by both exposure and outcome should not be adjusted for.","2014","2023-11-14 14:10:35","2023-11-14 14:12:51","","","","6085","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Methods: We compare previously proposed simulation-based approach for confounder identification that can be tailored to each specific study and contrast it with commonly applied methods (significance criteria with cutoff levels of p-values of 0.05 or 0.20, and CIE criterion with a cutoff of 10 %), as well as newly proposed two-stage procedure aimed at reduction of false positives (specifically, risk factors that are not confounders). The new procedure first evaluates potential for confounding by examination of correlation of covariates and applies simulated CIE criteria only if there is evidence of correlation, while rejecting a covariate as confounder otherwise. These approaches are compared in simulations studies with binary, continuous, and survival outcomes. We illustrate the application of our proposed confounder identification strategy in examining the association of exposure to mercury in relation to depression in the presence of suspected confounding by fish intake using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009–2010 data. Results: Our simulations showed that the simulation-determined cutoff was very sensitive to measurement error in exposure and potential confounder. The analysis of NHANES data demonstrated that if the noise-to-signal ratio (error variance in confounder/variance of confounder) is at or below 0.5, roughly 80 % of the simulated analyses adjusting for fish consumption would correctly result in a null association of mercury and depression, and only an extremely poorly measured confounder is not useful to adjust for in this setting. Conclusions: No a prior criterion developed for a specific application is guaranteed to be suitable for confounder identification in general. The customization of model-building strategies and study designs through simulations that consider the likely imperfections in the data, as well as finite-sample behavior, would constitute an important improvement on some of the currently prevailing practices in confounder identification and evaluation.

Observational studies can contribute valuable evidence supporting causal associations when designed and conducted using rigorous methods. The “flaws” are a result of reliance on outdated methodology, inadequate attention to threats to validity (such as confounding), opaque reporting of results, lack of replication, and a failure to interpret findings within the context of the limitations of observational research methodology.

This guidance takes the form of a call for investigators to consider making major changes to their approach to such studies. This document represents our current best understanding of approaches to causal inference, an active area of research.  We anticipate that best practice in this, as in any scientific endeavor, will continue to evolve, requiring this document to be updated every 5 to 10 years.

This review examined the use of DAGs in applied health research to inform rec- ommendations for improving their transparency and utility in future research. Methods: Original health research articles published during 1999–2017 mentioning ‘di- rected acyclic graphs’ (or similar) or citing DAGitty were identified from Scopus, Web of Science, Medline and Embase. Data were extracted on the reporting of: estimands, DAGs and adjustment sets, alongside the characteristics of each article’s largest DAG. Results: A total of 234 articles were identified that reported using DAGs. A fifth (n ¼ 48, 21%) reported their target estimand(s) and half (n ¼ 115, 48%) reported the adjustment set(s) implied by their DAG(s). Two-thirds of the articles (n ¼ 144, 62%) made at least one DAG available. DAGs varied in size but averaged 12 nodes [interquartile range (IQR): 9–16, range: 3–28] and 29 arcs (IQR: 19–42, range: 3–99). The median saturation (i.e. per- centage of total possible arcs) was 46% (IQR: 31–67, range: 12–100). 37% (n ¼ 53) of the DAGs included unobserved variables, 17% (n ¼ 25) included ‘super-nodes’ (i.e. nodes containing more than one variable) and 34% (n ¼ 49) were visually arranged so that the constituent arcs flowed in the same direction (e.g. top-to-bottom).

There are two broad classes of approaches for these purposes: use of confounders and instrumental variables (IVs). Because such approaches are largely characterized by untestable assumptions, analysts must operate under an indefinite paradigm that these methods will work imperfectly. In this tutorial, we formalize a set of general principles and heuristics for estimating causal effects in the two approaches when the assumptions are potentially violated. This crucially requires reframing the process of observational studies as hypothesizing potential scenarios where the estimates from one approach are less inconsistent than the other. While most of our discussion of methodology centers around the linear setting, we touch upon complexities in non-linear settings and flexible procedures such as target minimum loss-based estimation and double machine learning. To demonstrate the application of our principles, we investigate the use of donepezil off-label for mild cognitive impairment. We compare and contrast results from confounder and IV methods, traditional and flexible, within our analysis and to a similar observational study and clinical trial.","2023","2023-11-14 14:42:00","2023-11-14 14:44:47","","","","122","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When outcomes are missing not at random (MNAR), the estimated treatment effect will be biased when missingness is ignored, as in a complete case analysis (CCA), but also when using methods that assume outcomes are missing at random (MAR), such as multiple imputation. The National Research Council and European Medical Agency recommend assessing the robust- ness of the main analysis by performing sensitivity analyses under a range of plausible alternative MNAR assumptions, using pattern mixture models (PMMs) and selection models (SMs). The Cochrane Collaboration advise assessing the risk of MNAR bias by checking for differential dropout, while other sources additionally recommend examining the distribution of baseline co- variates across trial arms in the observed data. However, these guidelines are rarely implemented in practice. Within this thesis, I aimed to develop novel markers of MNAR dropout and sensitivity analyses that could be adopted to assess and account for the risk of bias. In all chapters, I describe the methods and apply these to multiple trials. In Chapter 2, I propose using observed differences in outcome variance between trial arms as a marker of MNAR dropout. In Chapter 3, I investigate additional potential markers of MNAR dropout across various dropout scenarios, showing that existing risk-of-bias tools are not conclusive. I propose additional markers that can be used in concert to assess the risk of MNAR dropout. In Chapter 4, I consider the trimmed means (TM) estimator, which estimates the treatment effect using data remaining after trimming equal fractions of both groups. I propose using this estimator as simpler alternative to PMM and SM sensitivity analyses and derive formulae for establishing the direction of bias of CCA and TM estimates.","","2023-11-14 14:44:53","2023-11-14 14:47:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Secondary issues concern the auxiliary data for non-response adjustment and post-stratification, the modelling methods, and the subsequent weight calculation methods. There are also important considerations relating to documentation, access and user support.","2010-11","2023-11-17 14:18:40","2023-11-17 14:35:13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Robins","Single World Intervention Graphs (SWIGs): A Unification of the Counterfactual and Graphical Approaches to Causality","Working Paper","","","","","We present a simple graphical theory unifying causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and potential (aka counterfactual) outcomes via a node-splitting transformation. We introduce a new graph, the Single-World Intervention Graph (SWIG). The SWIG encodes the counterfactual independences as- sociated with a specific hypothetical intervention on the set of treatment variables. The nodes on the SWIG are the corresponding counterfactual random variables. We illustrate the theory with a number of examples. Our graphical theory of SWIGs may be used to infer the counterfactual indepen- dence relations implied by the counterfactual models developed in Robins (1986, 1987). Moreover, in the absence of hidden variables, the joint dis- tribution of the counterfactuals is identified; the identifying formula is the extended g-computation formula introduced in (Robins et al., 2004). Al- though Robins (1986, 1987) did not use DAGs we translate his algebraic results to facilitate understanding of this prior work. An attractive feature of Robins’ approach is that it largely avoids making counterfactual inde- pendence assumptions that are experimentally untestable. As an important illustration we revisit the critique of Robins’ g-computation given in (Pearl, 2009, Ch. 11.3.7); we use SWIGs to show that all of Pearl’s claims are either erroneous or based on misconceptions. We also show that simple extensions of the formalism may be used to accommodate dynamic regimes, and to formulate non-parametric structural equation models in which assumptions relating to the absence of direct ef- fects are formulated at the population level. Finally, we show that our graphical theory also naturally arises in the context of an expanded causal Bayesian network in which we are able to observe the natural state of a variable prior to intervention.","2013-04","2023-11-17 14:22:11","2023-11-17 14:26:07","","","","","128","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose simple sensitivity analyses that apply to complete-case estimates of treatment effects; these analyses use only simple summary data and obviate specifying the precise mechanism of missingness and making distributional assumptions. Bias arises when treatment effects differ between retained and nonretained participants or, among retained participants, the estimate is biased because conditioning on retention has induced a noncausal path between the treatment and outcome. We thus bound the overall treatment effect on the difference scale by specifying: 1) the unobserved treatment effect among nonretained participants; and 2) the strengths of association that unobserved variables have with the exposure and with the outcome among retained participants (“induced confounding associations”). Working with the former sensitivity parameter subsumes certain existing methods of worst-case imputation while also accommodating less-conservative assumptions (e.g., that the treatment is not detrimental on average even among nonretained participants). As an analog to the E-value for confounding, we propose the M-value, which represents, for a specified treatment effect among nonretained participants, the strength of induced confounding associations required to reduce the treatment effect to the null or to any other value. These methods could help characterize the robustness of complete-case analyses to potential bias due to missing data.","2022-12","2023-11-17 14:26:23","2023-11-17 14:27:49","","","","4","192","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Selection bias can sometimes be eliminated by conditioning on a “sufficient adjustment set” of covariates, even for some forms of missingness not at random (MNAR). Without requiring full specification of the causal structure, we consider sufficient adjustment sets to allow nonparametric identification of conditional ATEs in the target population. Covariates in the sufficient set may be collected among only the selected sample. We establish that if a sufficient set exists, then the set consisting of common causes of the outcome and selection, excluding the exposure and its descendants, also suffices. We establish simple graphical criteria for when a sufficient set will not exist, which could help indicate whether this is plausible for a given study. Simulations considering selection due to missing data indicated that sufficiently-adjusted complete-case analysis (CCA) can considerably outperform multiple imputation under MNAR and, if the sample size is not large, sometimes even under missingness at random. Analogous to the common-cause principle for confounding, these sufficiency results clarify when and how selection bias can be eliminated through covariate adjustment.","2023","2023-11-17 14:28:09","2023-11-17 14:34:07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We provide simple graphical rules that indicate: (1) if a selected-sample analysis will be unbiased for each ATE; (2) whether adjusting for certain covariates could eliminate selection bias. The rules can easily be checked in a standard single-world intervention graph. When the treatment could affect selection, a third estimand of potential scientific interest is the “net treatment difference”, namely the net change in outcomes that would occur for the selected sample if all members of the general population were treated versus not treated, including any effects of the treatment on which individuals are in the selected sample. We provide graphical rules for this estimand as well. We decompose bias in a selected-sample analysis relative to the general-population ATE into: (1) “internal bias” relative to the net treatment difference; (2) “net-external bias”, a discrepancy between the net treatment difference and the general-population ATE. Each bias can be assessed unambiguously via a distinct graphical rule, providing new conceptual insight into the mechanisms by which certain causal structures produce selection bias.","","2023-11-17 14:30:51","2023-11-17 14:33:07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The causal relationships the covariates have with one another is assumed unknown. We propose that control be made for any covariate that is either a cause of treatment or of the outcome or both. We show that irrespective of the actual underlying causal structure, if any subset of the observed covariates suffices to control for confounding then the set of covariates chosen by our criterion will also suffice. We show that other, commonly used, criteria for confounding control do not have this property. We use formal theory concerning causal diagrams to prove our result but the application of the result does not rely on familiarity with causal diagrams. An investigator simply need ask, “Is the covariate a cause of the treatment?” and “Is the covariate a cause of the outcome?” If the answer to either question is “yes” then the covariate is included for confounder control. We discuss some additional covariate selection results that preserve unconfoundedness and that may be of interest when used with our criterion.","2011-12","2023-11-17 14:40:44","2023-11-17 14:42:59","","1406-1413","","4","67","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Discussion: This paper provides an overview on the counterfactual and related approaches. A variety of conceptual as well as practical issues when estimating causal effects are reviewed. These include causal interactions, imperfect experiments, adjustment for confounding, time-varying exposures, competing risks and the probability of causation. It is argued that the counterfactual model of causal effects captures the main aspects of causality in health sciences and relates to many statistical procedures. Summary: Counterfactuals are the basis of causal inference in medicine and epidemiology. Nevertheless, the estimation of counterfactual differences pose several difficulties, primarily in observational studies.

Many instrumental variable studies estimate the local average treatment effect (i.e., the effect in the “compliers”) under the assumption of monotonicity, i.e., no “defiers,” and well-defined compliance types. However, the monotonicity assumption has not been empirically tested and the meaning of monotonicity itself is unclear. Methods—Here we clarify the definition of local and global monotonicity and propose a novel study design to assess the monotonicity assumption empirically. Our design requires surveying physicians about their treatment plans and prescribing preferences for the same set of patients. We also discuss measures of monotonicity that can be calculated from this survey data. As an illustration, we conducted a pilot study in a survey of 53 physicians who reported treatment plans and prescribing preferences for hypothetical patients who were candidates for antipsychotic treatment. Results—In our study, nearly all patients exhibited some degree of monotonicity violations. In addition, patients could not be cleanly classified as compliers, defiers, always-takers, or never- takers. Conclusions—We conclude that preference-based instrumental variable estimates should be interpreted cautiously because bias due to monotonicity violations is likely and because the subpopulation to which the estimate applies may not be well-defined. Investigators using preference-based instruments may consider supplementing their study with a survey to empirically assess the magnitude and direction of bias due to violations of monotonicity.","2015-05","2023-11-27 20:13:06","2023-11-27 20:15:31","","414-420","","3","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This leap between exposures as measured and exposures as intervened upon is typically supported by the consistency assumption. The consistency assumption has received extensive attention in risk factor epidemiology but relatively little emphasis in social epidemiology. However, violations of the consistency assumption may be especially important to consider when understanding how social and economic exposures influence health. Efforts to clarify the definitions of our exposures, thus bolstering the consistency assumption, will help guide interventions to improve population health and reduce health disparities. This article focuses on the consistency assumption as considered within social epidemiology. We explain how this assumption is articulated in the causal inference literature and give examples of how it might be violated for three common exposure in social epidemiology research: income, education and neighborhood characteristics. We conclude that there is good reason to worry about consistency assumption violations in much of social epidemiology research. Theoretically motivated explorations of mechanisms along with empirical comparisons of research findings under alternative operationalizations of exposure can help identify consistency violations. We recommend that future social epidemiology studies be more explicit to name and discuss the consistency assumption when describing the exposure of interest, including reconciling disparate results in the literature.","2016-03","2023-11-27 20:18:25","2023-11-27 20:21:23","","63-71","","1","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An instrument is a variable that predicts exposure, but conditional on exposure shows no independent association with the outcome. The random assignment in trials is an example of what would be expected to be an ideal instrument, but instruments can also be found in observational settings with a naturally varying phenomenon e.g. geographical variation, physical distance to facility or physician’s preference. The fourth identifying assumption has received less attention, but is essential for the generalisability of estimated effects. The instrument identifies the group of compliers in which exposure is pseudo-randomly assigned leading to exchange- ability with regard to unmeasured confounders.

In the epidemiologic literature, discussion of whether the assumptions underlying IVanalyses hold is often limited to only certain assumptions and even then, arguments are mostly made using subject matter knowledge. To complement subject matter knowledge, there exist a variety of falsification strategies and other tools for weighing the plausibility of the assumptions underlying IV analyses. Recent Findings There are many tools that can refute the IV assumptions or help estimate the magnitude or direction of possible bias if the conditions do not hold perfectly. Many of these tools, including both recently developed strategies and strategies described decades ago, are underused or only used in specific applications of IV methods in epidemiology. Summary Although estimating causal effects with IV analyses relies on unverifiable assumptions, the assumptions can some- times be refuted. We suggest that the epidemiologists using IV analyses employ all the falsification strategies that apply to their research question in order to avoid settings that demonstrably violate a core condition for valid inference.","2018","2023-11-27 20:23:23","2023-11-27 20:25:09","","214-220","","","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in epidemiological studies, the exposure is often a coarsened approximation to some latent continuous trait. For example, latent liability to schizophrenia can be thought of as underlying the binary diagnosis measure. Genetically driven variation in the outcome can exist within categories of the exposure mea- surement, thus violating this assumption. We propose a framework to clarify this violation, deriving a simple expression for the resulting bias and showing that it may inflate or deflate effect estimates but will not reverse their sign. We then characterise a set of assumptions and a straight‐forward method for es- timating the effect of SD increases in the latent exposure. Our method relies on a sensitivity parameter which can be interpreted as the genetic variance of the latent exposure. We show that this method can be applied in both the one‐ sample and two‐sample settings.

Our work aims to assess the causal relationship between gout and hypertension. Methods: We obtained genetic information from the Taiwan Biobank, including 88,347 participants and 686,439 single‑nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A novel model of Mendelian randomisation (MR) with coarsened exposures was used to examine the causality between the liability of gout on hypertension and vice versa, using 4 SNPs associ‑ ated with gout and 10 SNPs associated with hypertension after removal of SNPs associated with measured confound‑ ers. The binary exposure (gout/hypertension) can be considered a coarsened approximation of a latent continuous trait. The inverse‑variance weighted (IVW) and polygenic risk score (PRS) methods were used to estimate effect size. The MR analysis with coarsened exposures was performed with and without adjustments for covariates. Results: Of the 88,347 participants, 3253 (3.68%) had gout and 11,948 (13.52%) had hypertension (men, 31.9%; mean age 51.1 [SD, 11.1] years). After adjusting to measured confounders, MR analysis with coarsened exposures showed a significant positive causal effect of the liability of gout on hypertension in both the IVW method (relative risk [RR], 1.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.03–1.19; p = 0.0077) and the PRS method (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.02–1.19; p = 0.0092). The result of causality was the same before and after involving measured confounders. However, there was no causal effect of the liability of hypertension on gout. Conclusions: In this study, we showed that the liability of gout has a causal effect on hypertension, but the liability of hypertension does not have a causal effect on gout. Adequate management of gout may reduce the risk of develop‑ ing hypertension.","2022","2023-11-27 20:32:37","2023-11-27 20:35:15","","","","243","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As this property is a standard component of Bayesian inference, we argue that in Bayesian causal inference it is natural to link the causal model, including the notion of confounding and definition of causal contrasts of interest, to the concept of exchangeability. Here we propose a probabilistic between- group exchangeability property as an identifying condition for causal effects, relate it to alternative conditions for unconfounded inferences (commonly stated using potential outcomes) and define causal contrasts in the presence of exchangeability in terms of posterior predictive expectations for further exchangeable units. While our main focus is on a point treatment setting, we also investigate how this reasoning carries over to longitudinal settings.","2023","2023-11-27 20:38:48","2024-01-29 14:59:17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we emphasize the importance and implications of this often-overlooked assumption. Further, we elaborate on the challenges nonoverlap poses to estimation and inference and discuss previously proposed methods. We distinguish between structural and practical violations and provide insight into which methods are appropriate for each.

However, technical, legal, ethical, and privacy concerns have so far limited the critical care medicine community from making these data readily available. The Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine have identified ICU patient data sharing as one of the priorities under their Joint Data Science Collaboration. To encourage ICUs worldwide to share their patient data responsibly, we now describe the development and release of Amsterdam University Medical Centers Database (AmsterdamUMCdb), the first freely available critical care database in full compliance with privacy laws from both the United States and Europe, as an example of the feasibility of sharing complex critical care data. SETTING:  University hospital ICU. SUBJECTS:  Data from ICU patients admitted between 2003 and 2016. INTERVENTIONS:  We used a risk-based deidentification strategy to maintain data utility while preserving privacy. In addition, we implemented contractual and governance processes, and a communication strategy. Patient organizations, supporting hospitals, and experts on ethics and privacy audited these processes and the database. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:  AmsterdamUMCdb contains approximately 1 billion clinical data points from 23,106 admissions of 20,109 patients. The privacy audit concluded that reidentification is not reasonably likely, and AmsterdamUMCdb can therefore be considered as anonymous information, both in the context of the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the European General Data Protection Regulation. The ethics audit concluded that responsible data sharing imposes minimal burden, whereas the potential benefit is tremendous. CONCLUSIONS:  Technical, legal, ethical, and privacy challenges related to responsible data sharing can be addressed using a multidisciplinary approach. A risk-based deidentification strategy, that complies with both U.S. and European privacy regulations, should be the preferred approach to releasing ICU patient data. This supports the shared Society of Critical Care Medicine and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine vision to improve critical care outcomes through scientific inquiry of vast and combined ICU datasets.","2021-06","2024-01-29 13:46:35","2024-01-29 13:50:08","","e563-e577","","6","49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Parametric regression are susceptible to misspecification, and as a result are sub-optimal for variable selection. Flexible machine learning methods mitigate the reliance on the parametric assumptions, but do not provide as naturally defined variable importance measure as the covariate effect native to parametric models. We investigate a general variable selection approach when both the covariates and outcomes can be missing at random and have general missing data pat- terns. This approach exploits the flexibility of machine learning models and bootstrap imputation, which is amenable to nonparametric methods in which the covariate effects are not directly available. We conduct expansive simulations investigating the practical operating characteristics of the proposed variable selection approach, when combined with four tree-based machine learning methods, extreme gradient boosting, random forests, Bayesian additive regression trees, and conditional random forests, and two commonly used parametric methods, lasso and backward stepwise selection. Numeric results suggest that, extreme gradient boosting and Bayesian additive regression trees have the overall best variable selection performance with respect to the F1 score and Type I error, while the lasso and backward stepwise selection have subpar performance across various settings. There is no significant difference in the variable selection per- formance due to imputation methods.

The results indicate, for example, that problems of generalizability — differences between samples and populations — can greatly affect bias both in predictive models and in measures of error in these models.

PrEP is available free of charge in the United Kingdom from sexual health clinics. Expanding PrEP delivery to community pharmacies holds promise and aligns with UK government goals to eliminate new cases of HIV by 2030. The aim of this scoping review was to describe the existing evidence about the barriers to and facilitators of community pharmacy PrEP delivery, for pharmacists and pharmacy clients, as aligned with the Capacity Opportunity, Motivation Behaviour (COM-B) Model. Methods Five bibliographic and five review databases were searched from inception to August 2023. Literature of any study design was included if it discussed barriers and facilitators of community pharmacy PrEP delivery. Trial registrations, protocols and news articles were excluded. Results A total of 649 records were identified, 73 full texts were reviewed, and 56 met the inclusion criteria. Most of the included literature was original research (55%), from the United States of America (77%) conducted during or after the year 2020 (63%). Barriers to PrEP delivery for pharmacists included lack of knowledge, training and skills (capability), not having the necessary facilities (opportunity), concern about the costs of PrEP and believing that PrEP use could lead to risk behaviour’s and STIs (motivation). Facilitators included staff training (capability), time, the right facilities (opportunity), believing PrEP could be a source of profit and could reduce new HIV infections (motivation). For clients, barriers included lack of PrEP awareness (capability), pharmacy facilities (opportunity) and not considering pharmacists as healthcare providers (motivation). Facilitators included awareness of PrEP and pharmacist’s training to deliver it (capability), the accessibility of pharmacies (opportunity) and having an interest in PrEP (motivation). Conclusion To effectively enhance PrEP delivery in UK community pharmacies, the identified barriers and facilitators should be explored for relevance in the UK and subsequently addressed and leveraged at the pharmacy team, client and care pathway level. By comprehensively considering all aspects of the COM-B framework, community pharmacies could become crucial providers in expanding PrEP accessibility, contributing significantly to HIV prevention efforts.","2023","2024-01-29 13:56:50","2024-01-29 13:58:55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The full random effects model (FREM) is one of the full-covariate approaches used to identify rel- evant covariates in nonlinear mixed effects models. Here we explore the ability of FREM to handle missing (both missing completely at random (MCAR) and missing at random (MAR)) covariate data and compare it to the full fixed-effects model (FFEM) approach, applied either with complete case analysis or mean imputation. A global health dataset (20 421 children) was used to develop a FREM describing the changes of height for age Z-score (HAZ) over time. Simu- lated datasets (n = 1000) were generated with variable rates of missing (MCAR) covariate data (0%-90%) and different proportions of missing (MAR) data con- dition on either observed covariates or predicted HAZ. The three methods were used to re-estimate model and compared in terms of bias and precision which showed that FREM had only minor increases in bias and minor loss of precision at increasing percentages of missing (MCAR) covariate data and performed sim- ilarly in the MAR scenarios. Conversely, the FFEM approaches either collapsed at ≥70% of missing (MCAR) covariate data (FFEM complete case analysis) or had large bias increases and loss of precision (FFEM with mean imputation). Our results suggest that FREM is an appropriate approach to covariate model- ing for datasets with missing (MCAR and MAR) covariate data, such as in global health studies.","2023","2024-01-29 13:58:57","2024-01-29 14:02:58","","1-18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We find that many articles do not provide complete and transparent information about key aspects of the study, such as justifications for the number of simulation repetitions, Monte Carlo uncertainty estimates, or code and data to reproduce the simulation studies. To address this problem, we provide a summary of the ADEMP (Aims, Data-generating mechanism, Estimands and other targets, Methods, Performance measures) design and reporting framework from Morris, White, and Crowther (2019) adapted to simulation studies in psychology. Based on this framework, we provide ADEMP-PreReg, a step-by-step template for researchers to use when designing, potentially preregistering, and reporting their simulation studies. We give formulae for estimating common performance measures, their Monte Carlo standard errors, and for calculating the number of simulation repetitions to achieve a desired Monte Carlo standard error. Finally, we give a detailed tutorial on how to apply the ADEMP framework in practice using an example simulation study on the evaluation of methods for the analysis of pre–post measurement experiments.","2023","2024-01-29 14:02:59","2024-01-29 14:04:52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In general, when the medi- ator and outcome are missing not at random, the direct and indirect effects are not identifiable without further assumptions. In this work, we study the identifiability of the direct and indirect effects under some interpretable mechanisms that allow for missing not at random in the mediator and outcome. We evaluate the performance of statistical inference under those mechanisms through simulation studies and illustrate the proposed methods via the National Job Corps Study.","2023-09","2024-02-05 13:57:57","2024-02-05 14:01:10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whereas recent computing and methodological advances have permitted increased efficiency in the simulation process, known as variance reduction, such experiments remain limited by their finite nature and hence are subject to uncertainty; when a simulation is run more than once, different results are obtained. However, virtually no emphasis has been placed on reporting the uncertainty, referred to here as Monte Carlo error, associated with simulation results in the published literature, or on justifying the number of replications used. These deserve broader consideration. Here we present a series of simple and practical methods for estimating Monte Carlo error as well as determining the number of replications required to achieve a desired level of accuracy. The issues and methods are demonstrated with two simple examples, one evaluating operating characteristics of the maximum likelihood estimator for the parameters in logistic regression and the other in the context of using the bootstrap to obtain 95% confidence intervals. The results suggest that in many settings, Monte Carlo error may be more substantial than traditionally thought.","2009-05","2024-02-05 14:01:12","2024-02-05 14:05:06","","155-162","","2","63","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Indeed, it is reported in most statistical analyzes, and although it is not recommended as a final model selection tool, it provides an indication of the suitability of the chosen explanatory variables in predicting the response. In the classical setting, it is well known that the least-squares fit and coefficient of determination can be arbitrary and/or misleading in the presence of a single outlier. In many applied settings, the assumption of normality of the errors and the absence of outliers are difficult to establish. In these cases, robust procedures for estimation and inference in linear regression are available and provide a suitable alternative. In this paper we present a companion robust coefficient of determination that has several desirable properties not shared by others. It is robust to deviations from the specified regression model (like the presence of outliers), it is efficient if the errors are normally distributed, it does not make any assumption on the distribution of the explanatory variables (and therefore no assumption on the unconditional distribution of the responses). We also show that it is a consistent estimator of the population coefficient of determination. A simulation study and two real datasets support the appropriateness of this estimator, compared with classical (least-squares) and several previously proposed robust R2 , even for small sample sizes.","2010","2024-02-05 15:16:57","2024-02-05 15:19:29","","1852-1862","","","140","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The effect of an individual chemical on a health outcome can be weak and difficult to detect because of the relatively low level of exposures to many environmental pollutants. To tackle the challenging problem of assessing the health risk of exposure to a mixture of environmental pollutants, we propose a statistical approach to assessing the proportion of the variation of an outcome explained by a mixture of pollutants. The proposed approach avoids the difficult task of identifying specific pollutants that are responsible for the effects and may also be used to assess interactions among exposures. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach has very good performance.

Few simulation studies have been conducted to investigate its performance. Methods: An extensive simulation study was realized to compare different implementations of the change in estimate method. The implementations were also compared when estimating the association of body mass index with diastolic blood pressure in the PROspective Quebec Study on Work and Health. Results: All methods were susceptible to introduce important bias and to produce confidence intervals that included the true effect much less often than expected in at least some scenarios. Overall mixed results were obtained regarding the accuracy of estimators, as measured by the mean squared error. No implementation adequately differentiated confounders from non-confounders. In the real data analysis, none of the implementation decreased the estimated standard error.

Compared to univariable Mendelian randomization, MVMR is less prone to horizontal pleiotropy and enables estimation of the direct effect of each exposure on the outcome. However, MVMR faces greater challenges with weak instruments -- genetic variants that are weakly associated with some exposures conditional on the other exposures. This article focuses on MVMR using summary data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We provide a new asymptotic regime to analyze MVMR estimators with many weak instruments, allowing for linear combinations of exposures to have different degrees of instrument strength, and formally show that the popular multivariable inverse-variance weighted (MV-IVW) estimator's asymptotic behavior is highly sensitive to instruments' strength. We then propose a multivariable debiased IVW (MV-dIVW) estimator, which effectively reduces the asymptotic bias from weak instruments in MV-IVW, and introduce an adjusted version, MV-adIVW, for improved finite-sample robustness. We establish the theoretical properties of our proposed estimators and extend them to handle balanced horizontal pleiotropy.

There are different methods for partially empirically assessing the plausibility of unconfoundedness. However, most currently available methods require (at least partial) assumptions about the confounding structure, which may be difficult to know in practice. In this paper we describe a simple strategy for empirically assessing the plausibility of conditional unconfoundedness (i.e., whether the candidate set of covariates suffices for confounding adjustment) which does not require any assumptions about the confounding structure, requiring instead assumptions related to temporal ordering between covariates, exposure and outcome (which can be guaranteed by design), measurement error and selection into the study. The proposed method essentially relies on testing the association between a subset of covariates (those associated with the exposure given all other covariates) and the outcome conditional on the remaining covariates and the exposure. We describe the assumptions underlying the method, provide proofs, use simulations to corroborate the theory and illustrate the method with an applied example assessing the causal effect of length-for-age measured in childhood and intelligence quotient measured in adulthood using data from the 1982 Pelotas (Brazil) birth cohort. We also discuss the implications of measurement error and some important limitations.","2024-02","2024-02-22 17:19:08","2024-02-22 17:20:33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results: Risk prediction studies use statistical techniques to generate contextually specific data-driven models requiring a representative sample that identify people at risk of health conditions efficiently (target populations for interventions). Risk prediction studies do not necessarily include causes (targets of intervention), but may include cheap and easy to measure surrogates or biomarkers of causes. Explanatory studies, ideally embedded within an informative model of reality, assess the role of causal factors which if targeted for interventions, are likely to improve outcomes. Predictive models allow identification of people or populations at elevated disease risk enabling targeting of proven interventions acting on causal factors. Explanatory models allow identification of causal factors to target across populations to prevent disease.

Existing frameworks, such as empirical risk minimization or distributionally robust optimization, either lack generalizability for unseen distributions or rely on postulated distance measures. Alternatively, causality offers a data-driven and structural perspective to robust predictions. However, the assumptions necessary for causal inference can be overly stringent, and the robustness offered by such causal models often lacks flexibility. In this paper, we focus on causality-oriented robustness and propose Distributional Robustness via Invariant Gradients (DRIG), a method that exploits general additive interventions in training data for robust predictions against unseen interventions, and naturally interpolates between in-distribution prediction and causality. In a linear setting, we prove that DRIG yields predictions that are robust among a data-dependent class of distribution shifts. Furthermore, we show that our framework includes anchor regression (Rothenhäusler et al.\ 2021) as a special case, and that it yields prediction models that protect against more diverse perturbations. We extend our approach to the semi-supervised domain adaptation setting to further improve prediction performance.

Objective To examine all-cause and suicide mortalities in gender-referred adolescents and the impact of psychiatric morbidity on mortality. Methods Finnish nationwide cohort of all <23 year-old gender- referred adolescents in 1996–2019 (n=2083) and 16 643 matched controls. Cox regression models with HRs and 95% CIs were used to analyse all-cause and suicide mortalities. Findings Of the 55 deaths in the study population, 20 (36%) were suicides. In bivariate analyses, all- cause mortality did not statistically significantly differ between gender-referred adolescents and controls (0.5% vs 0.3%); however, the proportion of suicides was higher in the gender-referred group (0.3% vs 0.1%).  The all-cause mortality rate among gender-referred adolescents (controls) was 0.81 per 1000 person-years (0.40 per 1000 person- years), and the suicide mortality rate was 0.51 per 1000 person-years (0.12 per 1000 person-years). However, when specialist-level psychiatric treatment was controlled for, neither all-cause nor suicide mortality differed between the two groups: HR for all-cause mortality among gender- referred adolescents was 1.0 (95% CI 0.5 to 2.0) and for suicide mortality was 1.8 (95% CI 0.6 to 4.8).

We demonstrate use of a global randomization test as a falsification test for the exclusion restriction assumption. Using simulations, we explored the statistical power of the randomization test to detect an association between a genetic instrument and a covariate set due to (a) selection bias or (b) horizontal pleiotropy, compared to three approaches examining associations with individual covariates: (i) Bonferroni correction for the number of covariates, (ii) correction for the effective number of independent covariates, and (iii) an r 2 permutation-based approach. We conducted proof-of-principle analyses in UK Biobank, using CRP as the exposure and coronary heart disease (CHD) as the outcome. In simulations, power of the randomization test was higher than the other approaches for detecting selection bias when the correlation between the covariates was low (r 2 < 0.1), and at least as powerful as the other approaches across all simulated horizontal pleiotropy scenarios. In our applied example, we found strong evidence of selection bias using all approaches (e.g., global randomization test p < 0.002). We identified 51 of the 58 CRP genetic variants as horizontally pleiotropic, and estimated effects of CRP on CHD attenuated somewhat to the null when excluding these from the genetic risk score (OR = 0.96 [95% CI: 0.92, 1.00] versus 0.97 [95% CI: 0.90, 1.05] per 1-unit higher log CRP levels).

The LASSO estimator typically has one or more zero elements and thus shares characteristics of both shrinkage estimation and variable selection. In this article we treat the LASSO as a convex programming problem and derive its dual. Consideration of the primal and dual problems together leads to important new insights into the characteristics of the LASSO estimator and to an improved method for estimating its covariance matrix. Using these results we also develop an efficient algorithm for computing LASSO estimates which is usable even in cases where the number of regressors exceeds the number of observations.

Many approaches in use are stepwise selection procedures, which can be computationally expensive and ignore stochastic errors in the variable selection process.  In this article, penalized likelihood approaches are proposed to handle these kinds of problems. The proposed methods select variables and estimate coefficients simultaneously. Hence they enable us to construct confidence intervals for estimated parameters. The proposed approaches are distinguished from others in that the penalty functions are symmetric, nonconcave on 401 ˆ5, and have singularities at the origin to produce sparse solutions. Furthermore, the penalty functions should be bounded by a constant to reduce bias and satisfy certain conditions to yield continuous solutions. A new algorithm is proposed for optimizing penalized likelihood functions. The proposed ideas are widely applicable. They are readily applied to a variety of parametric models such as generalized linear models and robust regression models. They can also be applied easily to nonparametric modeling by using wavelets and splines. Rates of convergence of the proposed penalized likelihood estimators are established. Furthermore, with proper choice of regularization parameters, we show that the proposed estimators perform as well as the oracle procedure in variable selection; namely, they work as well as if the correct submodel were known. Our simulation shows that the newly proposed methods compare favorably with other variable selection techniques. Furthermore, the standard error formulas are tested to be accurate enough for practical applications.","2001","2024-04-23 13:47:15","2024-04-23 13:50:00","","1348-1360","","456","96","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Typically we have available a large collection of possible covariates from which we hope to select a parsimonious set for the efficient prediction of a response variable. Least Angle Regression (”LARS”), a new model selection algorithm, is a useful and less greedy version of traditional forward selection methods. Three main properties are derived. (1)A simple modification of the LARS algorithm implements the Lasso, an attractive version of Ordinary Least Squares that constrains the sum of the absolute regression coefficients; the LARS modification calculates all possible Lasso estimates for a given problem, using an order of magnitude less computer time than previous methods. (2)A different LARS modification efficiently implements Forward Stagewise linear regression, another promising new model selection method; this connection explains the similar numerical results previously observed for the Lasso and Stagewise, and helps understand the properties of both methods, which are seen as constrained versions of the simpler LARS algorithm. (3) A simple approximation for the degrees of freedom of a LARS estimate is available, from which we derive a Cp estimate of prediction error; this allows a principled choice among the range of possible LARS estimates. LARS and its variants are computationally efficient: the paper describes a publicly available algorithm that requires only the same order of magnitude of computational effort as Ordinary Least Squares applied to the full set of covariates.","2004-04","2024-04-23 13:50:02","2024-04-23 13:55:00","","407-499","","2","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consequently, there exist certain scenarios where the lasso is inconsistent for variable selection.

We show that the adaptive lasso enjoys the oracle properties; namely, it performs as well as if the true underlying model were given in advance. Similar to the lasso, the adaptive lasso is shown to be near-minimax optimal. Furthermore, the adaptive lasso can be solved by the same efficient algorithm for solving the lasso.

One consequence of this is as follows: while lasso makes optimal progress in terms of reducing the residual sum-of-squares per unit increase in L1-norm of the coefficient β, forward stage-wise is optimal per unit L1 arc-length traveled along the coefficient path.

Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underly all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: (1) queries about the effects of potential interventions, (also called “causal effects” or “policy evaluation”) (2) queries about probabilities of counterfactuals, (including assessment of “regret,” “attribution” or “causes of effects”) and (3) queries about direct and indirect effects (also known as “mediation”). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both.","2009","2024-04-23 14:00:22","2024-04-23 14:04:52","","96-146","","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Properties such as consistency have been studied, and are achieved by different lasso variations. Here we look at a fully Bayesian formulation of the problem, which is flexible enough to encompass most versions of the lasso that have been previously considered. The advantages of the hierarchical Bayesian formulations are many. In addition to the usual ease-of-interpretation of hierarchical models, the Bayesian formulation produces valid standard errors (which can be problematic for the frequentist lasso), and is based on a geometrically ergodic Markov chain. We compare the performance of the Bayesian lassos to their frequentist counterparts using simulations, data sets that previous lasso papers have used, and a difficult modeling problem for predicting the collapse of governments around the world. In terms of prediction mean squared error, the Bayesian lasso performance is similar to and, in some cases, better than, the frequentist lasso.","2010","2024-04-23 14:05:08","2024-04-23 14:07:21","","369-412","","2","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To handle the bias from time-varying confounders, covariates affecting the treatment assignment policy in the observational data, CRN uses domain adversarial training to build balancing representations of the patient history. At each timestep, CRN constructs a treatment invariant representation which removes the association between patient history and treatment assignments and thus can be reliably used for making counterfactual predictions.

For example, “How effective is a given treatment in preventing a disease?”; “Can one estimate obesity-related medical costs?”; “Could government actions have prevented the financial crisis of 2008?”; “Can hiring records prove an employer guilty of sex discrimination?” The peculiar nature of these questions is that they cannot be answered, or even articulated, in the traditional language of statistics. In fact, only recently has science acquired a mathematical language we can use to express such questions, with accompanying tools to allow us to answer them from data. The development of these tools has spawned a revolution in the way causality is treated in statistics and in many of its satellite disciplines, especially in the social and biomedical sciences. For example, in the technical program of the 2003 Joint Statistical Meeting in San Francisco, there were only 13 papers presented with the word “cause” or “causal” in their titles; the number of such papers exceeded 100 by the Boston meeting in 2014. These numbers represent a transformative shift of focus in statistics research, accompanied by unprecedented excitement about the new problems and challenges that are opening themselves to statistical analysis. Harvard’s political science professor Gary King puts this revolution in historical perspective: “More has been learned about causal inference in the last few decades than the sum total of everything that had been learned about it in all prior recorded history.” Yet this excitement remains barely seen among statistics educators, and is essentially absent from statistics textbooks, especially at the introductory level. The reasons for this disparity is deeply rooted in the tradition of statistical education and in how most statisticians view the role of statistical inference.","2016-03","2024-04-23 15:38:42","2024-04-23 15:47:51","","","160","","","","","","","","","","Wiley","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To handle arbitrary observation patterns, we interpret the data as samples from an underlying continuous-time process and propose to model its latent trajectory explicitly using the mathematics of controlled differential equations. This leads to a new approach, the Treatment Effect Neural Controlled Differential Equation (TE-CDE), that allows the potential outcomes to be evaluated at any time point. In addition, adversarial training is used to adjust for time-dependent confounding which is critical in longitudinal settings and is an added challenge not encountered in conventional time-series. To assess solutions to this problem, we propose a controllable simulation environment based on a model of tumor growth for a range of scenarios with irregular sampling reflective of a variety of clinical scenarios.

The method allows us to leverage the adaptivity, regularization and predictive power of nonparametric Bayesian procedures to estimate low-dimensional functionals of interest without being restricted by the holistic Bayesian formalism. Starting from a conventional nonparametric posterior, we target the functional of interest by transforming the entire distribution with a Bayesian bootstrap correction. We provide conditions for the resulting one-step posterior to possess calibrated frequentist properties and specialize the results for several canonical examples: the integrated squared density, the mean of a missing-at-random outcome, and the average causal treatment effect on the treated. The procedure is computationally attractive, requiring only a simple, efficient post-processing step that can be attached onto any arbitrary posterior sampling algorithm. Using the ACIC 2016 causal data analysis competition, we illustrate that our approach can outperform the existing state-of-the-art through the propagation of Bayesian uncertainty.","","2024-04-23 16:02:22","2024-04-23 16:04:18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A negative control outcome (NCO) is an outcome that is influenced by unobserved confounders of the exposure effects on the outcome in view, but is not causally impacted by the exposure. Tchetgen Tchetgen (2013) introduced the Control Outcome Calibration Approach (COCA) as a formal NCO counterfactual method to detect and correct for residual confounding bias. For identification, COCA treats the NCO as an error-prone proxy of the treatment-free counterfactual outcome of interest, and involves regressing the NCO on the treatment-free counterfactual, together with a rank-preserving structural model which assumes a constant individual-level causal effect. In this work, we establish nonparametric COCA identification for the average causal effect for the treated, without requiring rank-preservation, therefore accommodating unrestricted effect heterogeneity across units. This nonparametric identification result has important practical implications, as it provides single proxy confounding control, in contrast to recently proposed proximal causal inference, which relies for identification on a pair of confounding proxies. For COCA estimation we propose three separate strategies: (i) an extended propensity score approach, (ii) an outcome bridge function approach, and (iii) a doubly-robust approach. Finally, we illustrate the proposed methods in an application evaluating the causal impact of a Zika virus outbreak on birth rate in Brazil.","2024-05","2024-04-23 16:04:20","2024-04-23 16:06:11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, a gap persists in complex tasks such as causal inference, primarily due to challenges associated with intricate reasoning steps and high numerical precision requirements. In this work, we take a first step towards building causally-aware foundation models for complex tasks. We propose a novel, theoretically sound method called Causal Inference with Attention (CInA), which utilizes multiple unlabeled datasets to perform self-supervised causal learning, and subsequently enables zero-shot causal inference on unseen tasks with new data. This is based on our theoretical results that demonstrate the primal-dual connection between optimal covariate balancing and self-attention, facilitating zero-shot causal inference through the final layer of a trained transformer-type architecture. We demonstrate empirically that our approach CInA effectively generalizes to out-of-distribution datasets and various real-world datasets, matching or even surpassing traditional per-dataset causal inference methodologies.","2023-09","2024-04-23 16:06:13","2024-04-23 16:08:15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, our community has proposed numerous solutions in standard settings, high-dimensional treatment settings, and even longitudinal settings. While very diverse, the solution has mostly relied on neural networks for inference and simultaneous correction of assignment bias. New approaches typically build on top of previous approaches by proposing new (or refined) architectures and learning algorithms. However, the end result -- a neural-network-based inference machine -- remains unchallenged. In this paper, we introduce a different type of solution in the longitudinal setting: a closed-form ordinary differential equation (ODE). While we still rely on continuous optimization to learn an ODE, the resulting inference machine is no longer a neural network. Doing so yields several advantages such as interpretability, irregular sampling, and a different set of identification assumptions. Above all, we consider the introduction of a completely new type of solution to be our most important contribution as it may spark entirely new innovations in treatment effects in general. We facilitate this by formulating our contribution as a framework that can transform any ODE discovery method into a treatment effects method.","2024","2024-04-23 16:08:17","2024-04-23 16:12:29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective To evaluate the effect of a single invitation for PSA screening on prostate cancer–specific mortality at a median 15-year follow-up compared with no invitation for screening. Design, Setting, and Participants This secondary analysis of the CAP randomized clinical trial included men aged 50 to 69 years identified at 573 primary care practices in England and Wales. Primary care practices were randomized between September 25, 2001, and August 24, 2007, and men were enrolled between January 8, 2002, and January 20, 2009. Follow-up was completed on March 31, 2021. Intervention Men received a single invitation for a PSA screening test with subsequent diagnostic tests if the PSA level was 3.0 ng/mL or higher. The control group received standard practice (no invitation). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was reported previously. Of 8 prespecified secondary outcomes, results of 4 were reported previously. The 4 remaining prespecified secondary outcomes at 15-year follow-up were prostate cancer–specific mortality, all-cause mortality, and prostate cancer stage and Gleason grade at diagnosis. Results Of 415,357 eligible men (mean [SD] age, 59.0 [5.6] years), 98% were included in these analyses. Overall, 12,013 and 12,958 men with a prostate cancer diagnosis were in the intervention and control groups, respectively (15-year cumulative risk, 7.08% [95% CI, 6.95%-7.21%] and 6.94% [95% CI, 6.82%-7.06%], respectively). At a median 15-year follow-up, 1199 men in the intervention group (0.69% [95% CI, 0.65%-0.73%]) and 1451 men in the control group (0.78% [95% CI, 0.73%-0.82%]) died of prostate cancer (rate ratio [RR], 0.92 [95% CI, 0.85-0.99]; P=.03). Compared with the control, the PSA screening intervention increased detection of low-grade (Gleason score [GS] ≤6: 2.2% vs 1.6%; P<.001) and localized (T1/T2: 3.6% vs 3.1%; P<.001) disease but not intermediate (GS of 7), high-grade (GS ≥8), locally advanced (T3), or distally advanced (T4/N1/M1) tumors. There were 45,084 all-cause deaths in the intervention group (23.2% [95% CI, 23.0%-23.4%]) and 50,336 deaths in the control group (23.3% [95% CI, 23.1%-23.5%]) (RR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.94-1.01]; P=.11). Eight of the prostate cancer deaths in the intervention group (0.7%) and 7 deaths in the control group (0.5%) were related to a diagnostic biopsy or prostate cancer treatment. Conclusions and Relevance In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, a single invitation for PSA screening compared with standard practice without routine screening reduced prostate cancer deaths at a median follow-up of 15 years. However, the absolute reduction in deaths was small.

Systematic reviews of these studies play a key role in informing policy and practice. Systematic reviews should incorporate assessments of the risk of bias in results of the included studies. Objective To develop a new tool, Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies - of Exposures (ROBINS-E) to assess risk of bias in estimates from cohort studies of the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome. Methods and results ROBINS-E was developed by a large group of researchers from diverse research and public health disciplines through a series of working groups, in-person meetings and pilot testing phases. The tool aims to assess the risk of bias in a specific result (exposure effect estimate) from an individual observational study that examines the effect of an exposure on an outcome. A series of preliminary considerations informs the core ROBINS-E assessment, including details of the result being assessed and the causal effect being estimated. The assessment addresses bias within seven domains, through a series of ‘signalling questions’. Domain-level judgements about risk of bias are derived from the answers to these questions, then combined to produce an overall risk of bias judgement for the result, together with judgements about the direction of bias. Conclusion ROBINS-E provides a standardized framework for examining potential biases in results from cohort studies. Future work will produce variants of the tool for other epidemiologic study designs (e.g. case-control studies). We believe that ROBINS-E represents an important development in the integration of exposure assessment, evidence synthesis and causal inference.","2024","2024-04-23 16:17:38","2024-04-23 16:21:17","","108-602","","","186","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In a single pass of batched data, the proposed method repeatedly trains an ML algorithm and tests its empirical performance. Because it utilizes the entire sample for both learning and evaluation, cramming is significantly more data-efficient than sample-splitting. The cram method also naturally accommodates online learning algorithms, making its implementation computationally efficient. To demonstrate the power of the cram method, we consider the standard policy learning setting where cramming is applied to the same data to both develop an individualized treatment rule (ITR) and estimate the average outcome that would result if the learned ITR were to be deployed. We show that under a minimal set of assumptions, the resulting crammed evaluation estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal. While our asymptotic results require a relatively weak stabilization condition of ML algorithm, we develop a simple, generic method that can be used with any policy learning algorithm to satisfy this condition. Our extensive simulation studies show that, when compared to sample-splitting, cramming reduces the evaluation standard error by more than 40% while improving the performance of learned policy. We also apply the cram method to a randomized clinical trial to demonstrate its applicability to real-world problems. Finally, we briefly discuss future extensions of the cram method to other learning and evaluation settings.","2024-03","2024-04-23 16:21:18","2024-04-23 16:22:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Machine learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to define states and predict future events are commonplace activities of modern life. However, their penetration into acute care medicine has been slow, stuttering and uneven. Major obstacles to widespread effective application of AI approaches to the real-time care of the critically ill patient exist and need to be addressed. Main body Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) in acute and critical care environments support clinicians, not replace them at the bedside. As will be discussed in this review, the reasons are many and include the immaturity of AI-based systems to have situational awareness, the fundamental bias in many large databases that do not reflect the target population of patient being treated making fairness an important issue to address and technical barriers to the timely access to valid data and its display in a fashion useful for clinical workflow. The inherent “black-box” nature of many predictive algorithms and CDSS makes trustworthiness and acceptance by the medical community difficult. Logistically, collating and curating in real-time multidimensional data streams of various sources needed to inform the algorithms and ultimately display relevant clinical decisions support format that adapt to individual patient responses and signatures represent the efferent limb of these systems and is often ignored during initial validation efforts. Similarly, legal and commercial barriers to the access to many existing clinical databases limit studies to address fairness and generalizability of predictive models and management tools. Conclusions AI-based CDSS are evolving and are here to stay. It is our obligation to be good shepherds of their use and further development.","2024","2024-04-23 16:22:47","2024-04-23 16:24:03","","","","113","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
