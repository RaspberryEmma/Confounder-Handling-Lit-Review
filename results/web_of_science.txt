Building upon work by Wang et al. (2012, Biometrics 68, 661-671) and Lefebvre et al. (2014, Statistics in Medicine 33, 2797-2813), we propose and evaluate a Bayesian method to estimate average causal effects in studies with a large number of potential confounders, relatively few observations, likely interactions between confounders and the exposure of interest, and uncertainty on which confounders and interaction terms should be included. Our method is applicable across all exposures and outcomes that can be handled through generalized linear models. In this general setting, estimation of the average causal effect is different from estimation of the exposure coefficient in the outcome model due to noncollapsibility. We implement a Bayesian bootstrap procedure to integrate over the distribution of potential confounders and to estimate the causal effect. Our method permits estimation of both the overall population causal effect and effects in specified subpopulations, providing clear characterization of heterogeneous exposure effects that may vary considerably across different covariate profiles. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method performs well in small sample size situations with 100-150 observations and 50 covariates. The method is applied to data on 15,060 US Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor between 2000 and 2009 to evaluate whether surgery reduces hospital readmissions within 30 days of diagnosis.

This lack of detail may be understandable since selection should be strongly influenced by features of the particular study, including contextual (prior) information about covariates that may confound, modify, or mediate the effect under study. It is thus important that authors document their modeling goals and strategies and understand the contextual interpretation of model parameters and model selection criteria. To illustrate this point, we review several established strategies for selecting model covariates, describe their shortcomings, and point to refinements, assuming that the main goal is to derive the most accurate effect estimates obtainable from the data and available resources. This goal shifts the focus to prediction of exposure or potential outcomes (or both) to adjust for confounding; it thus differs from the goal of ordinary statistical modeling, which is to passively predict outcomes. Nonetheless, methods and software for passive prediction can be used for causal inference as well, provided that the target parameters are shifted appropriately.

Traditionally, a throw in the kitchen sink approach has been used to select covariates for inclusion into the propensity score, but recent work shows including unnecessary covariates can impact both the bias and statistical efficiency of propensity score estimators. In particular, the inclusion of covariates that impact exposure but not the outcome, can inflate standard errors without improving bias, while the inclusion of covariates associated with the outcome but unrelated to exposure can improve precision. We propose the outcome-adaptive lasso for selecting appropriate covariates for inclusion in propensity score models to account for confounding bias and maintaining statistical efficiency. This proposed approach can perform variable selection in the presence of a large number of spurious covariates, that is, covariates unrelated to outcome or exposure. We present theoretical and simulation results indicating that the outcome-adaptive lasso selects the propensity score model that includes all true confounders and predictors of outcome, while excluding other covariates. We illustrate covariate selection using the outcome-adaptive lasso, including comparison to alternative approaches, using simulated data and in a survey of patients using opioid therapy to manage chronic pain.

We assume all covariates being considered are pretreatment variables and that for each covariate it is known (i) whether the covariate is a cause of treatment, and (ii) whether the covariate is a cause of the outcome. The causal relationships the covariates have with one another is assumed unknown. We propose that control be made for any covariate that is either a cause of treatment or of the outcome or both. We show that irrespective of the actual underlying causal structure, if any subset of the observed covariates suffices to control for confounding then the set of covariates chosen by our criterion will also suffice. We show that other, commonly used, criteria for confounding control do not have this property. We use formal theory concerning causal diagrams to prove our result but the application of the result does not rely on familiarity with causal diagrams. An investigator simply need ask, Is the covariate a cause of the treatment? and Is the covariate a cause of the outcome? If the answer to either question is yes then the covariate is included for confounder control. We discuss some additional covariate selection results that preserve unconfoundedness and that may be of interest when used with our criterion.

Standard variable selection techniques aim to maximize predictive ability of the outcome model, but they ignore covariate associations with treatment and may not adjust for important confounders weakly associated to outcome. We propose a novel method for estimating causal effects that simultaneously considers models for both outcome and treatment, which we call the bilevel spike and slab causal estimator (BSSCE). By using a Bayesian formulation, BSSCE estimates the posterior distribution of all model parameters and provides straightforward and reliable inference. Spike and slab priors are used on each covariate coefficient which aim to minimize the mean squared error of the treatment effect estimator. Theoretical properties of the treatment effect estimator are derived justifying the prior used in BSSCE. Simulations show that BSSCE can substantially reduce mean squared error over numerous methods and performs especially well with large numbers of covariates, including situations where the number of covariates is greater than the sample size. We illustrate BSSCE by estimating the causal effect of vasoactive therapy vs. fluid resuscitation on hypotensive episode length for patients in the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care III critical care database.

As decisions in the era of "big data" are increasingly reliant on large and complex collections of digital data, researchers are frequently confronted with decisions regarding which of a high-dimensional covariate set to include in the PS model to satisfy the assumptions necessary for estimating average causal effects. Typically, simple or ad hoc methods are employed to arrive at a single PS model, without acknowledging the uncertainty associated with the model selection. We propose three Bayesian methods for PS variable selection and model averaging that (a) select relevant variables from a set of candidate variables to include in the PS model and (b) estimate causal treatment effects as weighted averages of estimates under different PS models. The associated weight for each PS model reflects the data-driven support for that model's ability to adjust for the necessary variables. We illustrate features of our proposed approaches with a simulation study, and ultimately use our methods to compare the effectiveness of surgical versus nonsurgical treatment for brain tumors among 2606 Medicare beneficiaries.

The authors present the results of two simulation studies designed to help epidemiologists gain insight into the variable selection problem in a PS analysis. The simulation studies illustrate how the choice of variables that are included in a PS model can affect the bias, variance, and mean squared error of an estimated exposure effect. The results suggest that variables that are unrelated to the exposure but related to the outcome should always be included in a PS model. The inclusion of these variables will decrease the variance of an estimated exposure effect without increasing bias. In contrast, including variables that are related to the exposure but not to the outcome will increase the variance of the estimated exposure effect without decreasing bias. In very small studies, the inclusion of variables that are strongly related to the exposure but only weakly related to the outcome can be detrimental to an estimate in a mean squared error sense. The addition of these variables removes only a small amount of bias but can increase the variance of the estimated exposure effect. These simulation studies and other analytical results suggest that standard model-building tools designed to create good predictive models of the exposure will not always lead to optimal PS models, particularly in small studies.

AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						confounding; epidemiologic methods; modeling; regression; variable selection	MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION; BOOSTING ALGORITHMS; REGRESSION; REGULARIZATION; PREDICTION; SHRINKAGE; INFERENCE; MARKOV	Variable selection in regression models is a particularly important issue in epidemiology, where one usually encounters observational studies. In contrast to randomized trials or experiments, confounding is often not controlled by the study design, but has to be accounted for by suitable statistical methods. For instance, when risk factors should be identified with unconfounded effect estimates, multivariable regression techniques can help to adjust for confounders. We investigated the current practice of variable selection in 4 major epidemiologic journals in 2019 and found that the majority of articles used subject-matter knowledge to determine a priori the set of included variables. In comparison with previous reviews from 2008 and 2015, fewer articles applied data-driven variable selection. Furthermore, for most articles the main aim of analysis was hypothesis-driven effect estimation in rather low-dimensional data situations (i.e., large sample size compared with the number of variables). Based on our results, we discuss the role of data-driven variable selection in epidemiology.

Thus, we propose a Bayesian two-stage spatially dependent variable selection approach for space-time health data to determine the spatially varying subsets of regression coefficients with common temporal dependence. The two-stage structure allows reduction of the spatial confounding bias in the estimates of the regression coefficients. A simulation study is conducted to examine the performance of the proposed two-stage model. We apply the proposed model to the number of inpatients with lung cancer in 159 counties of Georgia, USA.

Variables in the causal network take on multiple structural forms. Adjustment for a common cause pathway between treatment and outcome can remove confounding, whereas adjustment for other structural types may increase bias. For this reason, variable selection would ideally be based on an understanding of the causal network; however, the true causal network is rarely known. Therefore, we describe more practical variable selection approaches based on background knowledge when the causal structure is only partially known. These approaches include adjustment for all observed pretreatment variables thought to have some connection to the outcome, all known risk factors for the outcome, and all direct causes of the treatment or the outcome. Empirical approaches, such as forward and backward selection and automatic high-dimensional proxy adjustment, are also discussed. As there is a continuum between knowing and not knowing the causal, structural relations of variables, we recommend addressing variable selection in a practical way that involves a combination of background knowledge and empirical selection and that uses high-dimensional approaches. This empirical approach can be used to select from a set of a priori variables based on the researcher's knowledge to be included in the final analysis or to identify additional variables for consideration. This more limited use of empirically derived variables may reduce confounding while simultaneously reducing the risk of including variables that may increase bias.

Reporting of covariate selection and balance assessment in propensity score analysis is suboptimal: a systematic review	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Review						Balance; Confounding; Pharmacoepidemiology; Propensity score; Reporting; Variable selection	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; MEDICAL LITERATURE; CRITICAL-APPRAISAL; BIAS; STATISTICS; AUSTIN,PETER; ADJUSTMENT; REGRESSION; INFERENCE; VARIABLES	Objectives: To assess the current practice of propensity score (PS) analysis in the medical literature, particularly the assessment and reporting of balance on confounders. Study Design and Setting: A PubMed search identified studies using PS methods from December 2011 through May 2012. For each article included in the review, information was extracted on important aspects of the PS such as the type of PS method used, variable selection for PS model, and assessment of balance. Results: Among 296 articles that were included in the review, variable selection for PS model was explicitly reported in 102 studies (34.4%). Covariate balance was checked and reported in 177 studies (59.8%). P-values were the most commonly used statistical tools to report balance (125 of 177, 70.6%). The standardized difference and graphical displays were reported in 45 (25.4%) and 11(6.2%) articles, respectively. Matching on the PS was the most commonly used approach to control for confounding (68.9%), followed by PS adjustment (20.9%), PS stratification (13.9%), and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW, 7.1%). Balance was more often checked in articles using PS matching and IPTW, 70.6% and 71.4%, respectively. Conclusion: The execution and reporting of covatiate selection and assessment of balance is far from optimal. Recommendations on reporting of PS analysis are provided to allow better appraisal of the validity of PS-based studies. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Ali, M. Sanni; Groenwold, Rolf H.

Methods for the Selection of Covariates in Nutritional Epidemiology Studies: A Meta-Epidemiological Review	CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN NUTRITION			English	Review						confounding; covariate; model building; research methods; nutritional epidemiology	CAUSAL DIAGRAMS; VARIABLE SELECTION; MODEL SELECTION; QUALITY; ISSUES; BIAS; INTERVENTION; SENSITIVITY; REDUCTION; SHRINKAGE	Background: Observational studies provide important information about the effects of exposures that cannot be easily studied in clinical trials, such as nutritional exposures, but are subject to confounding. Investigators adjust for confounders by entering them as covariates in analytic models. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the reporting and credibility of methods for selection of covariates in nutritional epidemiology studies. Methods: We sampled 150 nutritional epidemiology studies published in 2007/2008 and 2017/2018 from the top 5 high-impact nutrition and medical journals and extracted information on methods for selection of covariates. Results: Most studies did not report selecting covariates a priori (94.0%) or criteria for selection of covariates (63.3%). There was general inconsistency in choice of covariates, even among studies investigating similar questions. One-third of studies did not acknowledge potential for residual confounding in their discussion. Conclusion: Studies often do not report methods for selection of covariates, follow available guidance for selection of covariates, nor discuss potential for residual confounding.

Data-adaptive longitudinal model selection in causal inference with collaborative targeted minimum loss-based estimation	BIOMETRICS			English	Article						collaborative double robustness; saturated marginal structural model; targeted minimum loss-based estimation	VARIABLE SELECTION; THERAPY	Causal inference methods have been developed for longitudinal observational study designs where confounding is thought to occur over time. In particular, one may estimate and contrast the population mean counterfactual outcome under specific exposure patterns. In such contexts, confounders of the longitudinal treatment-outcome association are generally identified using domain-specific knowledge. However, this may leave an analyst with a large set of potential confounders that may hinder estimation. Previous approaches to data-adaptive model selection for this type of causal parameter were limited to the single time-point setting. We develop a longitudinal extension of a collaborative targeted minimum loss-based estimation (C-TMLE) algorithm that can be applied to perform variable selection in the models for the probability of treatment with the goal of improving the estimation of the population mean counterfactual outcome under a fixed exposure pattern. We investigate the properties of this method through a simulation study, comparing it to G-Computation and inverse probability of treatment weighting. We then apply the method in a real-data example to evaluate the safety of trimester-specific exposure to inhaled corticosteroids during pregnancy in women with mild asthma. The data for this study were obtained from the linkage of electronic health databases in the province of Quebec, Canada. The C-TMLE covariate selection approach allowed for a reduction of the set of potential confounders, which included baseline and longitudinal variables.

Introduction to causal diagrams for confounder selection	RESPIROLOGY			English	Review						causal inference; confounding; directed acyclic graph; observational study	DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPHS; BIAS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MODELS	In respiratory health research, interest often lies in estimating the effect of an exposure on a health outcome. If randomization of the exposure of interest is not possible, estimating its effect is typically complicated by confounding bias. This can often be dealt with by controlling for the variables causing the confounding, if measured, in the statistical analysis. Common statistical methods used to achieve this include multivariable regression models adjusting for selected confounding variables or stratification on those variables. Therefore, a key question is which measured variables need to be controlled for in order to remove confounding. An approach to confounder-selection based on the use of causal diagrams (often called directed acyclic graphs) is discussed. A causal diagram is a visual representation of the causal relationships believed to exist between the variables of interest, including the exposure, outcome and potential confounding variables. After creating a causal diagram for the research question, an intuitive and easy-to-use set of rules can be applied, based on a foundation of rigorous mathematics, to decide which measured variables must be controlled for in the statistical analysis in order to remove confounding, to the extent that is possible using the available data. This approach is illustrated by constructing a causal diagram for the research question: Does personal smoking affect the risk of subsequent asthma?'. Using data taken from the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study, the statistical analysis suggested by the causal diagram approach was performed.

Confounding bias threatens the reliability of studies using such data. The successful control of confounding requires knowledge of variables called confounders affecting both the exposure and outcome of interest. However, causal knowledge of dynamic biological systems is complex and challenging. Fortunately, computable knowledge mined from the literature may hold clues about confounders. In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that incorporating literaturederived confounders can improve causal inference from observational data. Methods: We introduce two methods (semantic vector-based and string-based confounder search) that query literature-derived information for confounder candidates to control, using SemMedDB, a database of computable knowledge mined from the biomedical literature. These methods search SemMedDB for confounders by applying semantic constraint search for indications treated by the drug (exposure) and that are also known to cause the adverse event (outcome). We then include the literature-derived confounder candidates in statistical and causal models derived from free-text clinical notes. For evaluation, we use a reference dataset widely used in drug safety containing labeled pairwise relationships between drugs and adverse events and attempt to rediscover these relationships from a corpus of 2.2 M NLP-processed free-text clinical notes. We employ standard adjustment and causal inference procedures to predict and estimate causal effects by informing the models with varying numbers of literature-derived confounders and instantiating the exposure, outcome, and confounder variables in the models with dichotomous EHR-derived data. Finally, we compare the results from applying these procedures with naive measures of association (chi 2 and reporting odds ratio) and with each other. Results and Conclusions: We found semantic vector-based search to be superior to string-based search at reducing confounding bias. However, the effect of including more rather than fewer literature-derived confounders was inconclusive. We recommend using targeted learning estimation methods that can address treatment-confounder feedback, where confounders also behave as intermediate variables, and engaging subject-matter experts to adjudicate the handling of problematic covariates.

We illustrate these limitations in the case of random confounding and designs that prevent such confounding. In many experimental designs individual treatment allocations are dependent, and explicit population models are needed to show this dependency. In particular, certain designs impose unfaithful covariate-treatment distributions to prevent random confounding, yet ordinary causal graphs cannot discriminate between these unconfounded designs and confounded studies. Causal models for populations are better suited for displaying these phenomena than are individual-level models, because they allow representation of allocation dependencies as well as outcome dependencies across individuals. Nonetheless, even with this extension, ordinary graphical models still fail to capture distinctions between hypothetical superpopulations (sampling distributions) and observed populations (actual distributions), although potential-outcome models can be adapted to show these distinctions and their consequences.

Variable Selection for Confounding Adjustment in High-dimensional Covariate Spaces When Analyzing Healthcare Databases	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							PROPENSITY-SCORE; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; SIMULATION; SHRINKAGE; EVENTS; NUMBER; SAFETY; BIAS	Background: Data-adaptive approaches to confounding adjustment may improve performance beyond expert knowledge when analyzing electronic healthcare databases and have additional practical advantages for analyzing multiple databases in rapid cycles. Improvements seemed possible if outcome predictors were reliably identified empirically and adjusted. Methods: In five cohort studies from diverse healthcare databases, we implemented a base-case high-dimensional propensity score algorithm with propensity score decile-adjusted outcome models to estimate treatment effects among prescription drug initiators. The original variable selection procedure based on the estimated bias of each variable using unadjusted associations between confounders and exposure (RRCE) and disease outcome (RRCD) was augmented by alternative strategies. These included using increasingly adjusted RRCD estimates, including models considering > 1,500 variables jointly (Lasso, Bayesian logistic regression); using prediction statistics or likelihood-ratio statistics for covariate prioritization; directly estimating the propensity score with > 1,500 variables (Lasso, Bayesian regression); or directly fitting an outcome model using all covariates jointly (Lasso, Ridge). Results: In five example studies, most tested augmentations of the base-case hdPS did not meaningfully change estimates in light of wide confidence intervals except for Bayesian regression and Lasso to estimate RRCD, which moved estimates minimally closer to the expectation in three of five examples. The direct outcome estimation with Lasso performed worst. Conclusion: Overall, the basic heuristic of variable reduction in highdimensional propensity score adjustment performed, as well as alternative approaches in diverse settings. Minor improvements in variable selection may be possible using Bayesian outcome regression to prioritize variables for propensity score estimation when outcomes are rare.

Bayesian variable selection in hierarchical difference-in-differences models	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Bayesian hierarchical modeling; diabetes mellitus; difference-in-differences; primary care redesign; variable selection	PROPENSITY SCORE; PRIMARY-CARE; ADJUSTMENT	A popular method for estimating a causal treatment effect with observational data is the difference-in-differences model. In this work, we consider an extension of the classical difference-in-differences setting to the hierarchical context in which data cannot be matched at the most granular level. Our motivating example is an application to assess the impact of primary care redesign policy on diabetes outcomes in Minnesota, in which the policy is administered at the clinic level and individual outcomes are not matched from pre- to post-intervention. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical difference-in-differences model, which estimates the policy effect by regressing the treatment on a latent variable representing the mean change in group-level outcome. We present theoretical and empirical results showing a hierarchical difference-in-differences model that fails to adjust for a particular class of confounding variables, biases the policy effect estimate. Using a structured Bayesian spike-and-slab model that leverages the temporal structure of the difference-in-differences context, we propose and implement variable selection approaches that target sets of confounding variables leading to unbiased and efficient estimation of the policy effect. We evaluate the methods' properties through simulation, and we use them to assess the impact of primary care redesign of clinics in Minnesota on the management of diabetes outcomes from 2008 to 2017.

Twenty-five scenarios with case-control samples were generated from 10 simulated populations in order to address the performance of these covariate selection procedures in the presence of confounders of various strengths and under DAG misspecification with omission of confounders or inclusion of nonconfounders. Performance was evaluated by standard error, bias, square root of the mean-squared error, and 95% confidence interval coverage. In most scenarios, the DAG full model without further covariate selection performed as well as or better than the other procedures when the DAGs were correctly specified, as well as when confounders were omitted. Model reduction by using change-in-estimate procedures showed potential gains in precision when the DAGs included nonconfounders, but underestimation of regression-based standard error might cause reduction in 95% confidence interval coverage. For modeling binary outcomes in a case-control study, the authors recommend construction of a "conservative" DAG, determination of all potential confounders, and then change-in-estimate procedures to simplify this full model. The authors advocate that, under the conditions investigated, the selection of final model should be based on changes in precision: Adopt the reduced model if its standard error (derived from logistic regression) is substantially smaller; otherwise, the full DAG-based model is appropriate.

This has led to an interest in developing microbial interventions for treatment of disease and optimization of crop yields which requires identification of microbiome features that impact the outcome in the population of interest. That task is challenging because of the high dimensionality of microbiome data and the confounding that results from the complex and dynamic interactions among host, environment, and microbiome. In the presence of such confounding, variable selection and estimation procedures may have unsatisfactory performance in identifying microbial features with an effect on the outcome. Results In this manuscript, we aim to estimate population-level effects of individual microbiome features while controlling for confounding by a categorical variable. Due to the high dimensionality and confounding-induced correlation between features, we propose feature screening, selection, and estimation conditional on each stratum of the confounder followed by a standardization approach to estimation of population-level effects of individual features. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate the advantages of our approach in recovering relevant features. Utilizing a potential-outcomes framework, we outline assumptions required to ascribe causal, rather than associational, interpretations to the identified microbiome effects. We conducted an agricultural study of the rhizosphere microbiome of sorghum in which nitrogen fertilizer application is a confounding variable. In this study, the proposed approach identified microbial taxa that are consistent with biological understanding of potential plant-microbe interactions. Conclusions Standardization enables more accurate identification of individual microbiome features with an effect on the outcome of interest compared to other variable selection and estimation procedures when there is confounding by a categorical variable.

Selection of confounding variables should not be based on observed associations with exposure	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Bias; Confounder selection; Confounding; Pharmacoepidemiology	CLINICAL-TRIALS; MODELS; BIAS	In observational studies, selection of confounding variables for adjustment is often based on observed baseline incomparability. The aim of this study was to evaluate this selection strategy. We used clinical data on the effects of inhaled long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) use on the risk of mortality among patients with obstructive pulmonary disease to illustrate the impact of selection of confounding variables for adjustment based on baseline comparisons. Among 2,394 asthma and COPD patients included in the analyses, the LABA ever-users were considerably older than never-users, but cardiovascular co-morbidity was equally prevalent (19.9% vs. 19.9%). Adjustment for cardiovascular co-morbidity status did not affect the crude risk ratio (RR) for mortality: crude RR 1.19 (95% CI 0.93-1.51) versus RR 1.19 (95% CI 0.94-1.50) after adjustment for cardiovascular co-morbidity. However, after adjustment for age (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76-1.19), additional adjustment for cardiovascular co-morbidity status did affect the association between LABA use and mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.80-1.26). Confounding variables should not be discarded based on balanced distributions among exposure groups, because residual confounding due to the omission of confounding variables from the adjustment model can be relevant.

J	Van Lancker, K; Dukes, O; Vansteelandt, S				Van Lancker, Kelly; Dukes, Oliver; Vansteelandt, Stijn			Ensuring valid inference for Cox hazard ratios after variable selection	BIOMETRICS			English	Article						causal inference; confounding; double selection; post-selection inference; variable selection	CONFIDENCE-REGIONS; MODEL-SELECTION; LASSO	The problem of how to best select variables for confounding adjustment forms one of the key challenges in the evaluation of exposure effects in observational studies, and has been the subject of vigorous recent activity in causal inference. A major drawback of routine procedures is that there is no finite sample size at which they are guaranteed to deliver exposure effect estimators and associated confidence intervals with adequate performance. In this work, we will consider this problem when inferring conditional causal hazard ratios from observational studies under the assumption of no unmeasured confounding. The major complication that we face with survival data is that the key confounding variables may not be those that explain the censoring mechanism. In this paper, we overcome this problem using a novel and simple procedure that can be implemented using off-the-shelf software for penalized Cox regression. In particular, we will propose tests of the null hypothesis that the exposure has no effect on the considered survival endpoint, which are uniformly valid under standard sparsity conditions. Simulation results show that the proposed methods yield valid inferences even when covariates are high-dimensional.

One technique to deal with potential confounding is propensity score (PS) analysis, which allows for the adjustment for measured preexposure covariates. Since its first publication in 2009, the high-dimensional propensity score (hdPS) method has emerged as an approach that extends traditional PS covariate selection to include large numbers of covariates that may reduce confounding bias in the analysis of healthcare databases. hdPS is an automated, data-driven analytic approach for covariate selection that empirically identifies preexposure variables and proxies to include in the PS model. This article provides an overview of the hdPS approach and recommendations on the planning, implementation, and reporting of hdPS used for causal treatment-effect estimations in longitudinal healthcare databases. We supply a checklist with key considerations as a supportive decision tool to aid investigators in the implementation and transparent reporting of hdPS techniques, and to aid decision-makers unfamiliar with hdPS in the understanding and interpretation of studies employing this approach.

J	Talbot, D; Beaudoin, C				Talbot, Denis; Beaudoin, Claudia			A generalized double robust Bayesian model averaging approach to causal effect estimation with application to the study of osteoporotic fractures	JOURNAL OF CAUSAL INFERENCE			English	Article						causal inference; confounding; double robustness; model averaging; model selection	COVARIATE SELECTION; VARIABLE SELECTION; INFERENCE; UNCERTAINTY; CONFOUNDER; LASSO	Analysts often use data-driven approaches to supplement their knowledge when selecting covariates for effect estimation. Multiple variable selection procedures for causal effect estimation have been devised in recent years, but additional developments are still required to adequately address the needs of analysts. We propose a generalized Bayesian causal effect estimation (GBCEE) algorithm to perform variable selection and produce double robust (DR) estimates of causal effects for binary or continuous exposures and outcomes. GBCEE employs a prior distribution that targets the selection of true confounders and predictors of the outcome for the unbiased estimation of causal effects with reduced standard errors. The Bayesian machinery allows GBCEE to directly produce inferences for its estimate. In simulations, GBCEE was observed to perform similarly or to outperform DR alternatives. Its ability to directly produce inferences is also an important advantage from a computational perspective. The method is finally illustrated for the estimation of the effect of meeting physical activity recommendations on the risk of hip or upper-leg fractures among older women in the study of osteoporotic fractures. The 95% confidence interval produced by GBCEE is 61% narrower than that of a DR estimator adjusting for all potential confounders in this illustration.

To do this, researchers must identify and adjust for all potential confounding variables, while avoiding inappropriate adjustment for mediator variables on a causal pathway between the exposure and outcome. Unfortunately, 'overadjustment bias' remains a common and under-recognized problem in social epidemiology. This paper offers an introduction on selecting appropriate variables for adjustment when examining effects of SEP on health, with a focus on overadjustment bias. We discuss the challenges of estimating different causal effects including overadjustment bias, provide guidance on overcoming them, and consider specific issues including the timing of variables across the life-course, mutual adjustment for socioeconomic indicators, and conducting systematic reviews. We recommend three key steps to select the most appropriate variables for adjustment. First, researchers should be clear about their research question and causal effect of interest. Second, using expert knowledge and theory, researchers should draw causal diagrams representing their assumptions about the interrelationships between their variables of interest. Third, based on their causal diagram(s) and causal effect(s) of interest, researchers should select the most appropriate set of variables, which maximizes adjustment for confounding while minimizing adjustment for mediators.

It refers to unmeasured characteristics of individuals that lead them both to be in a particular "treatment" category and to register higher or lower values than others on a response variable. In this article, I introduce readers to 2 econometric techniques designed to control the problem, with a particular emphasis on the Heckman selection model (HSM). Both techniques can be used with only cross-sectional data. Using a Monte Carlo experiment, I compare the performance of instrumental-variable regression (IVR) and HSM to that of ordinary least squares (OLS) under conditions with treatment and unmeasured confounding both present and absent. I find HSM generally to outperform IVR with respect to mean-square-error of treatment estimates, as well as power for detecting either a treatment effect or unobserved confounding. However, both HSM and IVR require a large sample to be fully effective. The use of HSM and IVR in tandem with OLS to untangle unobserved confounding bias in cross-sectional data is further demonstrated with an empirical application. Using data from the 2006 - 2010 General Social Survey (National Opinion Research Center, 2014), I examine the association between being married and subjective well-being.

The modelling approach typically involves selecting both a lag at which the effect of particulates should be evaluated and a level of filtering to remove long-term associations confounded with seasonal variations and secular trend. In this paper we investigate the bias introduced by model selection and residual confounding using simulations based on a previous analysis of data from King County, Washington. In comparison with the original analyses we find that the bias is small in absolute terms but of the same order as the estimated health impacts. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

These phenomena are particularly dangerous in internet-based public health surveillance, where traditional mitigation and adjustment methods are inapplicable, unavailable, or out of date. Recent theoretical advances in causal modeling can mitigate these threats, but these innovations have not been widely deployed in the epidemiological community.Objective: The purpose of our paper is to demonstrate the practical utility of causal modeling to both detect unmeasured confounding and selection bias and guide model selection to minimize bias. We implemented this approach in an applied epidemiological study of the COVID-19 cumulative infection rate in the New York City (NYC) spring 2020 epidemic.Methods: We collected primary data from Qualtrics surveys of Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) crowd workers residing in New Jersey and New York State across 2 sampling periods: April 11-14 and May 8-11, 2020. The surveys queried the subjects on household health status and demographic characteristics. We constructed a set of possible causal models of household infection and survey selection mechanisms and ranked them by compatibility with the collected survey data. The most compatible causal model was then used to estimate the cumulative infection rate in each survey period.Results: There were 527 and 513 responses collected for the 2 periods, respectively. Response demographics were highly skewed toward a younger age in both survey periods. Despite the extremely strong relationship between age and COVID-19 symptoms, we recovered minimally biased estimates of the cumulative infection rate using only primary data and the most compatible causal model, with a relative bias of +3.8% and -1.9% from the reported cumulative infection rate for the first andConclusions: We successfully recovered accurate estimates of the cumulative infection rate from an internet-based crowdsourced sample despite considerable selection bias and unmeasured confounding in the primary data. This implementation demonstrates how simple applications of structural causal modeling can be effectively used to determine falsifiable model conditions, detect selection bias and confounding factors, and minimize estimate bias through model selection in a novel epidemiological context. As the disease and social dynamics of COVID-19 continue to evolve, public health surveillance protocols must continue to adapt; the emergence of Omicron variants and shift to at-home testing as recent challenges. Rigorous and transparent methods to develop, deploy, and diagnosis adapted surveillance protocols will be critical to their success.

J	Greenland, S				Greenland, S			Quantifying biases in causal models:: Classical confounding <i>vs</i> collider-stratification bias	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						adjustment; causal diagrams; causal inference; odds ratio; relative risk; validity	ENDOMETRIAL CANCER; ESTROGENS; INFERENCE; KNOWLEDGE; DIAGRAMS	It has long been known that stratifying on variables affected by the study exposure can create selection bias. More recently it has been shown that stratifying on a variable that precedes exposure and disease can induce confounding, even if there is no confounding in the unstratified (crude) estimate. This paper examines the relative magnitudes of these biases under some simple causal models in which the stratification variable is graphically depicted as a collider (a variable directly affected by two or more other variables in the graph). The results suggest that bias from stratifying on variables affected by exposure and disease may often be comparable in size with bias from classical confounding (bias from failing to stratify on a common cause of exposure and disease), whereas other biases from collider stratification may tend to be much smaller.

J	Hogan, JW; Lancaster, T				Hogan, JW; Lancaster, T			Instrumental variables and inverse probability weighting for causal inference from longitudinal observational studies	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article							MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; TIME-VARYING EXPOSURE; DROP-OUT; IDENTIFICATION; NONCOMPLIANCE; REGRESSION; ASSUMPTIONS	Inferring causal effects from longitudinal repeated measures data has high relevance to a number of areas of research, including economics, social sciences and epidemiology. In observational studies in particular, the treatment receipt mechanism is typically not under the control of the investigator; it can depend on various factors, including the outcome of interest. This results in differential selection into treatment levels, and can lead to selection bias when standard routines such as least squares regression are used to estimate causal effects. Interestingly, both the characterization of and methodology for handling selection bias can differ substantially by disciplinary tradition. In social sciences and economics, instrumental variables (IV) is the standard method for estimating linear and nonlinear models in which the error term may be correlated with an observed covariate. When such correlation is not ruled out, the covariate is called endogenous and least squares estimates of the covariate effect are typically biased. The availability of an instrumental variable can be used to reduce or eliminate the bias. In public health and clinical medicine (e.g., epidemiology and biostatistics), selection bias is typically viewed in terms of confounders, and the prevailing methods are geared toward making proper adjustments via explicit use of observed confounders (e.g., stratification, standardization). A class of methods known as inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimators, which relies on modeling selection in terms of confounders, is gaining in popularity for making such adjustments. Our objective is to review and compare IPW and IV for estimating causal treatment effects from longitudinal data, where the treatment may vary with time. We accomplish this by defining the causal estimands in terms of a linear stochastic model of potential outcomes (counterfactuals). Our comparison includes a review of terminology typically used in discussions of causal inference (e.g., confounding, endogeneity); a review of assumptions required to identify causal effects and their implications for estimation and interpretation; description of estimation via inverse weighting and instrumental variables; and a comparative analysis of data from a longitudinal cohort study of HIV-infected women. In our discussion of assumptions and estimation routines, we try to emphasize sufficient conditions needed to implement relatively standard analyses that can essentially be formulated as regression models. In that sense this review is geared toward the quantitative practitioner. The objective of the data analysis is to estimate the causal (therapeutic) effect of receiving combination antiviral therapy on longitudinal CD4 cell counts, where receipt of therapy varies with time and depends on CD4 count and other covariates. Assumptions are reviewed in context, and resulting inferences are compared. The analysis illustrates the importance of considering the existence of unmeasured confounding and of checking for 'weak instruments.' It also suggests that IV methodology may have a role in longitudinal cohort studies where potential instrumental variables are available.

The authors present findings from the Slone Epidemiology Unit Birth Defects Study, 1992-1997, a case-control study on folic acid supplementation and risk of neural tube defects. When statistical strategies for confounding evaluation are used, the adjusted odds ratio is 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.62, 1.21). However, the consideration of a priori causal knowledge suggests that the crude odds ratio of 0.65 (95% confidence interval: 0.46, 0.94) should be used because the adjusted odds ratio is invalid. Causal diagrams are used to encode qualitative a priori subject matter knowledge.

A comparison of confounder selection and adjustment methods for estimating causal effects using large healthcare databases	PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY			English	Article						algorithms; biostatistics; confounding factors; machine learning; pharmacoepidemiology; propensity score	DIMENSIONAL PROPENSITY SCORE; COVARIATE SELECTION; VARIABLE SELECTION; MODEL-SELECTION; SUPER LEARNER; INFERENCE; PREDICTION; LASSO; BIAS	Purpose Confounding adjustment is required to estimate the effect of an exposure on an outcome in observational studies. However, variable selection and unmeasured confounding are particularly challenging when analyzing large healthcare data. Machine learning methods may help address these challenges. The objective was to evaluate the capacity of such methods to select confounders and reduce unmeasured confounding bias. Methods A simulation study with known true effects was conducted. Completely synthetic and partially synthetic data incorporating real large healthcare data were generated. We compared Bayesian adjustment for confounding (BAC), generalized Bayesian causal effect estimation (GBCEE), Group Lasso and Doubly robust estimation, high-dimensional propensity score (hdPS), and scalable collaborative targeted maximum likelihood algorithms. For the hdPS, two adjustment approaches targeting the effect in the whole population were considered: Full matching and inverse probability weighting. Results In scenarios without hidden confounders, most methods were essentially unbiased. The bias and variance of the hdPS varied considerably according to the number of variables selected by the algorithm. In scenarios with hidden confounders, substantial bias reduction was achieved by using machine-learning methods to identify proxies as compared to adjusting only by observed confounders. hdPS and Group Lasso performed poorly in the partially synthetic simulation. BAC, GBCEE, and scalable collaborative-targeted maximum likelihood algorithms performed particularly well. Conclusions Machine learning can help to identify measured confounders in large healthcare databases. They can also capitalize on proxies of unmeasured confounders to substantially reduce residual confounding bias.

J	Papadogeorgou, G; Dominici, F				Papadogeorgou, Georgia; Dominici, Francesca			A CAUSAL EXPOSURE RESPONSE FUNCTION WITH LOCAL ADJUSTMENT FOR CONFOUNDING: ESTIMATING HEALTH EFFECTS OF EXPOSURE TO LOW LEVELS OF AMBIENT FINE PARTICULATE MATTER	ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Air pollution; cardiovascular hospitalizations; causal inference; exposure response function; local confounding; low-exposure levels; particulate matter	AIR-POLLUTION EXPOSURE; CANADIAN CENSUS HEALTH; TERM PM2.5 EXPOSURE; MORTALITY; ASSOCIATION; SELECTION; CURVE; RISK; POPULATION; COHORT	In the last two decades ambient levels of air pollution have declined substantially. At the same time the Clean Air Act mandates that the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) must be routinely assessed to protect populations based on the latest science. Therefore, researchers should continue to address the following question: is exposure to levels of air pollution below the NAAQS harmful to human health? Furthermore, the contentious nature surrounding environmental regulations urges us to cast this question within a causal inference framework. Several parametric and semiparametric regression approaches have been used to estimate the exposure-response (ER) curve between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution concentrations and health outcomes. However, most of the existing approaches are not formulated within a formal framework for causal inference, adjust for the same set of potential confounders across all levels of exposure and do not account for model uncertainty regarding covariate selection and the shape of the ER. In this paper we introduce a Bayesian framework for the estimation of a causal ER curve called LERCA (Local Exposure Response Confounding Adjustment), which: (a) allows for different confounders and different strength of confounding at the different exposure levels, and (b) propagates model uncertainty regarding confounders' selection and the shape of the ER. Importantly, LERCA provides a principled way of assessing the observed covariates' confounding importance at different exposure levels, providing researchers with important information regarding the set of variables to measure and adjust for in regression models. Using simulation studies, we show that state-of-the-art approaches perform poorly in estimating the ER curve in the presence of local confounding. LERCA is used to evaluate the relationship between long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5, a key regulated pollutant, and cardiovascular hospitalizations for 5,362 zip codes in the continental U.S. and located near a pollution monitoring site, while adjusting for a potentially varying set of confounders across the exposure range. Our data set includes rich health, weather, demographic and pollution information for the years of 2011-2013. The estimated exposure-response curve is increasingly indicating that higher ambient concentrations lead to higher cardiovascular hospitalization rates, and ambient PM2.5 was estimated to lead to an increase in cardiovascular hospitalization rates when focusing at the low-exposure range. Our results indicate that there is no threshold for the effect of PM2.5 on cardiovascular hospitalizations.

Time-Dependent Confounding in the Estimation of Treatment Effects in Randomised Trials with Multimodal Therapies - An Illustration of the Problem of Time-Dependent Confounding by Causal Graphs	GESUNDHEITSWESEN			German	Article						time-dependent confounding; selection bias; randomised trials; causal inference; directed acyclic graphs	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; INTENT-TO-TREAT	Biased effect estimates induced by unconsidered confounding variables are a known problem in observational studies. Selection bias, resulting from non-random sampling of study participants, is widely recognised as a problem in case-control and cross-sectional studies. In contrast, possible bias in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is mostly ignored. This paper illustrates, by applying directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), possible bias in the effect estimates of first-line therapy, caused by subsequent changes in therapy (time-dependent confounding). Possible selection bias, induced by not only random loss to follow-up, will be explained as well using DAGs. Underlying assumptions of standard methods usually used to analyse RCTs (like intention-to-treat, per-protocol) are shown and it is explained why effect estimates may be biased in RCTs, if only these conventional methods are used. Adequate statistical methods (causal inference models as marginal structural models and structural nested models) exist. Higher documentary efforts, however, are necessary, because any changes in medication, loss to follow-up as well as reasons for such changes need to be documented in detail as required by these advanced statistical methods. Nevertheless, causal inference models should become standard along side the currently applied standard methods, especially in studies with high non-compliance due to changes in therapy and substantial loss to follow-up. Possible bias cannot be excluded if similar results are obtained from both methods. However, study results should be interpreted with caution if they differ between both approaches.	[Zietemann, V.

The model is phrased in terms of a selection bias function and a baseline model that describes how covariates affect the survival time in a scenario without exposure. In this way model congeniality is ensured. The method uses an instrumental variable. Interestingly, the formulated model turns out to have similarities to the so-called Cox-Aalen survival model for the observed data. We exploit this to enhance estimation of the unknown parameters. This also allows us to derive large sample properties of the proposed estimator.

It is then tempting to use statistical variable-selection methods to reduce the number used for adjustment. Nonetheless, there is no agreement on how selection should be conducted, and it is well known that conventional selection methods lead to confidence intervals that are too narrow and p values that are too small. Furthermore, theory and simulation evidence have found no selection method to be uniformly superior to adjusting for all well-measured confounders. Nonetheless, control of all measured confounders can lead to problems for conventional model-fitting methods. When these problems occur, one can apply modern techniques such as shrinkage estimation, exposure modeling, or hybrids that combine outcome and exposure modeling. No selection or special software is needed for most of these techniques. It thus appears that statistical confounder selection may be an unnecessary complication in most regression analyses of effects.

The authors compared the performance of several such strategies for fitting multiplicative Poisson regression models to cohort data: 1)the ''change-in-estimate'' strategy, in which a variable is controlled if the adjusted and unadjusted estimates differ by some important amount; 2) the ''significance-test-of-the-covariate'' strategy, in which a variable is controlled if its coefficient is significantly different from zero at some predetermined significance level; 3) the ''significance-test-of-the-difference'' strategy, wh ich tests the difference between the adjusted and unadjusted exposure coefficients; 4) the ''equivalence-test-of-the-difference'' strategy, which significance-tests the equivalence of the adjusted and unadjusted exposure coefficients; and 5) a hybrid strategy that takes a weighted average of adjusted and unadjusted estimates. Data were generated from 8,100 population structures at each of several sample sizes. The performance of the different strategies was evaluated by computing bias, mean squared error, and coverage rates of confidence intervals. At least one variation of each strategy that was examined performed acceptably. The change-in-estimate and equivalence-test-of-the-difference strategies performed best when the cut-point for deciding whether crude and adjusted estimates differed by an important amount was set to a low value (10%). The significance test strategies performed best when the alpha level was set to much higher than conventional levels (0.20).

J	Shardell, M; Ferrucci, L				Shardell, Michelle; Ferrucci, Luigi			Joint mixed-effects models for causal inference with longitudinal data	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						causal inference; longitudinal data; missing not at random; time-dependent confounding; unmeasured confounding	SHARED-PARAMETER MODELS; EFFECTS LOGISTIC-MODELS; RANDOMIZED TRIALS; MISSING DATA; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MISSPECIFICATION; NONCOMPLIANCE; EXPOSURE; SURVIVAL; DECLINE	Causal inference with observational longitudinal data and time-varying exposures is complicated due to the potential for time-dependent confounding and unmeasured confounding. Most causal inference methods that handle time-dependent confounding rely on either the assumption of no unmeasured confounders or the availability of an unconfounded variable that is associated with the exposure (eg, an instrumental variable). Furthermore, when data are incomplete, validity of many methods often depends on the assumption of missing at random. We propose an approach that combines a parametric joint mixed-effects model for the study outcome and the exposure with g-computation to identify and estimate causal effects in the presence of time-dependent confounding and unmeasured confounding. G-computation can estimate participant-specific or population-average causal effects using parameters of the joint model. The joint model is a type of shared parameter model where the outcome and exposure-selection models share common random effect(s). We also extend the joint model to handle missing data and truncation by death when missingness is possibly not at random. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method using simulation studies and compare the method to both linear mixed- and fixed-effects models combined with g-computation as well as to targeted maximum likelihood estimation. We apply the method to an epidemiologic study of vitamin D and depressive symptoms in older adults and include code using SAS PROC NLMIXED software to enhance the accessibility of the method to applied researchers.

J	Wilson, IH; Wilson, SB				Wilson, Ian Harold; Wilson, Simon Barton			Confounding and causation in the epidemiology of lead	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH			English	Article						Lead epidemiology; confounding; statistical analysis; bias; threshold	BLOOD LEAD; ENVIRONMENTAL LEAD; CHILDRENS INTELLIGENCE; INTELLECTUAL-DEVELOPMENT; EXPOSURE; LEVEL; IQ; CONSEQUENCES; AGE	The National Health and Medical Research Council recently reported that there were not enough high-quality studies to conclude that associations between health effects and blood lead levels<10g/dL were caused by lead. It identified uncontrolled confounding, measurement error and other potential causal factors as common weaknesses. This paper supports those findings with evidence of uncontrolled confounding by parental education, intelligence or household management from several papers. It suggests that inappropriate statistical tests and aggregation of data representing different exposure routes partly explain why confounding has been overlooked. Inadequate correction of confounding has contributed to incorrect conclusions regarding causality at low levels of lead. Linear or log-linear regression models have tended to mask any threshold. While the effects of higher levels of lead exposure are not disputed, overestimation of health effects at low lead exposures has significant implications for policy-makers endeavouring to protect public health through cost-effective regulations.

J	Talbot, D; Massamba, VK				Talbot, Denis; Massamba, Victoria Kubuta			A descriptive review of variable selection methods in four epidemiologic journals: there is still room for improvement	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Review						Variable selection; Modeling; Confounding; Epidemiologic methods	CONFOUNDER-SELECTION; ADAPTIVE LASSO; UNCERTAINTY; ADJUSTMENT; RISK; SIMULATION	A review of epidemiological papers conducted in 2009 concluded that several studies employed variable selection methods susceptible to introduce bias and yield inadequate inferences. Many new confounder selection methods have been developed since then. The goal of the study was to provide an updated descriptive portrait of which variable selection methods are used by epidemiologists for analyzing observational data. Studies published in four major epidemiological journals in 2015 were reviewed. Only articles concerned with a predictive or explicative objective and reporting on the analysis of individual data were included. Method(s) employed for selecting variables were extracted from retained articles. A total of 975 articles were retrieved and 299 met eligibility criteria, 292 of which pursued an explicative objective. Among those, 146 studies (50%) reported using prior knowledge or causal graphs for selecting variables, 34 (12%) used change in effect estimate methods, 26 (9%) used stepwise approaches, 16 (5%) employed univariate analyses, 5 (2%) used various other methods and 107 (37%) did not provide sufficient details to allow classification (more than one method could be employed in a single article). Despite being less frequent than in the previous review, stepwise and univariable analyses, which are susceptible to introduce bias and produce inadequate inferences, were still prevalent. Moreover, 37% studies did not provide sufficient details to assess how variables were selected. We thus believe there is still room for improvement in variable selection methods used by epidemiologists and in their reporting.

We propose a Bayesian nonparametric approach that simultaneously (1) prioritizes inclusion of adjustment variables in accordance with existing principles of confounder selection; (2) estimates causal effects in a manner that permits complex relationships among confounders, exposures, and outcomes; and (3) provides causal estimates that account for uncertainty in the nature of confounding. The proposal relies on specification of multiple Bayesian additive regression trees models, linked together with a common prior distribution that accrues posterior selection probability to covariates on the basis of association with both the exposure and the outcome of interest. A set of extensive simulation studies demonstrates that the proposed method performs well relative to similarly-motivated methodologies in a variety of scenarios. We deploy the method to investigate the causal effect of emissions from coal-fired power plants on ambient air pollution concentrations, where the prospect of confounding due to local and regional meteorological factors introduces uncertainty around the confounding role of a high-dimensional set of measured variables. Ultimately, we show that the proposed method produces more efficient and more consistent results across adjacent years than alternative methods, lending strength to the evidence of the causal relationship between SO2 emissions and ambient particulate pollution.

Motivated by such modern applications, we consider the problem of variable selection and estimation in high-dimensional sparse instrumental variables models. To overcome the difficulty of high dimensionality and unknown optimal instruments, we propose a two-stage regularization framework for identifying and estimating important covariate effects while selecting and estimating optimal instruments. The methodology extends the classical two-stage least squares estimator to high dimensions by exploiting sparsity using sparsity-inducing penalty functions in both stages. The resulting procedure is efficiently implemented by coordinate descent optimization. For the representative L-1 regularization and a class of concave regularization methods, we establish estimation, prediction, and model selection properties of the two-stage regularized estimators in the high-dimensional setting where the dimensionality of covariates and instruments are both allowed to grow exponentially with the sample size. The practical performance of the proposed method is evaluated by simulation studies and its usefulness is illustrated by an analysis of mouse obesity data.

One possible reason is that many research programs involve themes in which there is a certain degree of uncertainty as to mechanisms in the processes that generate the data. In this study, the relationship between occupational stress and obesity is used as an example of the application of causal diagrams to questions related to confounding. The article presents the selection stages for variables in statistical adjustment and the derivation of a causal diagram's statistical implications. The main advantage of causal diagrams is that they explicitly reveal the respective model's underlying hypotheses, allowing critical analysis of the implications and thereby facilitating identification of sources of bias and uncertainty in the epidemiological study's results.

Appropriate adjustment for confounding in such studies is challenging because exposure is determined by a complex interaction of patient, physician, and healthcare system factors. The challenges of confounding control are particularly acute in studies using healthcare utilization databases where information on many potential confounding factors is lacking and the meaning of variables is often unclear. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of different approaches to confounder control in healthcare databases. In settings where considerable uncertainty surrounds the data or the causal mechanisms underlying the treatment assignment and outcome process, we suggest that researchers report a panel of results under various specifications of statistical models. Such reporting allows the reader to assess the sensitivity of the results to model assumptions that are often not supported by strong subject-matter knowledge.	[Brookhart, M.

J	Long, JP; Ha, MJ				Long, James P.; Ha, Min Jin			Sample selection bias in evaluation of prediction performance of causal models	STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND DATA MINING			English	Article						causal inference; genetic perturbation experiments; prediction; sample selection bias	INFERENCE	Causal models are notoriously difficult to validate because they make untestable assumptions regarding confounding. New scientific experiments offer the possibility of evaluating causal models using prediction performance. Prediction performance measures are typically robust to violations in causal assumptions. However, prediction performance does depend on the selection of training and test sets. Biased training sets can lead to optimistic assessments of model performance. In this work, we revisit the prediction performance of several recently proposed causal models tested on a genetic perturbation data set of Kemmeren. We find that sample selection bias is likely a key driver of model performance. We propose using a less-biased evaluation set for assessing prediction performance and compare models on this new set. In this setting, the causal models have similar or worse performance compared to standard association-based estimators such as Lasso. Finally, we compare the performance of causal estimators in simulation studies that reproduce the Kemmeren structure of genetic knockout experiments but without any sample selection bias. These results provide an improved understanding of the performance of several causal models and offer guidance on how future studies should use Kemmeren.

These assumptions include, but are not limited to, properly accounting for 2 important sources of bias: confounding and selection bias. While not adjusting the causal association for an intermediate variable will yield an unbiased estimate of the exposure-outcome's total causal effect, it is often that obstetricians will want to adjust for an intermediate variable to assess if the intermediate is the underlying driver of the association. Such a practice must be weighed in light of the underlying research question and whether such an adjustment is necessary should be carefully considered. Gestational age is, by far, the most commonly encountered variable in obstetrics that is often mislabeled as a confounder when, in fact, it may be an intermediate. If, indeed, gestational age is an intermediate but if mistakenly labeled as a confounding variable and consequently adjusted in an analysis, the conclusions can be unexpected. The implications of this overadjustment of an intermediate as though it were a confounder can render an otherwise persuasive study downright meaningless. This commentary provides an exposition of confounding bias, collider stratification, and selection biases, with applications in obstetrics and perinatal epidemiology.

Causal models are increasingly applied in risk factor epidemiology, economics, and health policy, but seldom used in statistical genetics or genetic epidemiology. Unlike the statistical models usually used in genetic epidemiology, causal models are explicitly formulated in terms of cause and effect relationships occurring at the individual level. Methods: We describe two causal models, the sufficient component cause model and the potential outcomes model, and show how key concepts in genetic epidemiology, including penetrance, phenocopies, genetic heterogeneity, etiologic heterogeneity, gene-gene interaction, and gene-environment interaction, can be framed in terms of these causal models. We also illustrate how potential outcomes models can provide insight into the potential for confounding and bias in the measurement of causal effects in genetic studies. Results: Our analysis illustrates how causal models can elucidate the relationships among underlying causal mechanisms and measures obtained from statistical analysis of observed data. Conclusion: Causal models can enhance research aimed at identifying causal genes. Copyright (C) 2011 S.

Constructing Causal Diagrams for Common Perinatal Outcomes: Benefits, Limitations and Motivating Examples with Maternal Antidepressant Use in Pregnancy	PAEDIATRIC AND PERINATAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						causal inference; directed acyclic graphs; perinatal epidemiology	FAILURE-TO-THRIVE; BIAS; BIRTH; RISK; ADJUSTMENT; DEPRESSION	Background: Covariate selection to reduce bias in observational data analysis has primarily relied upon statistical criteria to guide researchers. This approach may lead researchers to condition on variables that ultimately increase bias in the effect estimates. The use of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) aids researchers in constructing thoughtful models based on hypothesised biologic mechanisms to produce the least biased effect estimates possible. Methods: After providing an overview of different relations in DAGs and the prevailing mechanisms by which conditioning on variables increases or reduces bias in a model, we illustrate examples of DAGs for maternal antidepressants in pregnancy and four separate perinatal outcomes. Results: By comparing and contrasting the diagrams for maternal antidepressant use in pregnancy and spontaneous abortion, major malformations, preterm birth, and postnatal growth, we illustrate the different conditioning sets required for each model. Moreover, we illustrate why it is not appropriate to condition on the same set of covariates for the same exposure and different perinatal outcomes. We further discuss potential selection biases, overadjustment of mediators on the causal path, and sufficient sets of conditioning variables. Conclusion: In our efforts to construct parsimonious models that minimise confounding and selection biases, we must rely upon our scientific knowledge of the causal mechanism. By structuring data collection and analysis around hypothesised DAGs, we ultimately aim to validly estimate the causal effect of interest.

J	Antonelli, J; Parmigiani, G; Dominici, F				Antonelli, Joseph; Parmigiani, Giovanni; Dominici, Francesca			High-Dimensional Confounding Adjustment Using Continuous Spike and Slab Priors	BAYESIAN ANALYSIS			English	Article						high-dimensional data; causal inference; bayesian variable selection; shrinkage priors	VARIABLE-SELECTION; PROPENSITY SCORE; CAUSAL INFERENCE; ADAPTIVE LASSO; UNCERTAINTY; EXPOSOME; BAYES	In observational studies, estimation of a causal effect of a treatment on an outcome relies on proper adjustment for confounding. If the number of the potential confounders (p) is larger than the number of observations (n), then direct control for all potential confounders is infeasible. Existing approaches for dimension reduction and penalization are generally aimed at predicting the outcome, and are less suited for estimation of causal effects. Under standard penalization approaches (e.g. Lasso), if a variable X-j is strongly associated with the treatment T but weakly with the outcome Y, the coefficient beta(j) will be shrunk towards zero thus leading to confounding bias. Under the assumption of a linear model for the outcome and sparsity, we propose continuous spike and slab priors on the regression coefficients beta(j) corresponding to the potential confounders X-j. Specifically, we introduce a prior distribution that does not heavily shrink to zero the coefficients (beta(j)s) of the X(j)s that are strongly associated with T but weakly associated with Y. We compare our proposed approach to several state of the art methods proposed in the literature. Our proposed approach has the following features: 1) it reduces confounding bias in high dimensional settings; 2) it shrinks towards zero coefficients of instrumental variables; and 3) it achieves good coverages even in small sample sizes. We apply our approach to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data to estimate the causal effects of persistent pesticide exposure on triglyceride levels.

Health care data scientists use data-adaptive approaches that automatically optimize confounding control to study causal treatment effects. This article summarizes relevant experiences and extensions. Methods: The literature was reviewed on the uses of high-dimensional propensity score (HDPS) and related approaches for health care database analyses, including methodological articles on their performance and improvement. Articles were grouped into applications, comparative performance studies, and statistical simulation experiments. Results: The HDPS algorithm has been referenced frequently with a variety of clinical applications and data sources from around the world. The appeal of HDPS for database research rests in 1) its superior performance in situations of unobserved confounding through proxy adjustment, 2) its predictable efficiency in extracting confounding information from a given data source, 3) its ability to automate estimation of causal treatment effects to the extent achievable in a given data source, and 4) its independence of data source and coding system. Extensions of the HDPS approach have focused on improving variable selection when exposure is sparse, using free text information and time-varying confounding adjustment. Conclusion: Semiautomated and optimized confounding adjustment in health care database analyses has proven successful across a wide range of settings. Machine-learning extensions further automate its use in estimating causal treatment effects across a range of data scenarios.

Time-modified Confounding	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						bias (epidemiology); confounding factors (epidemiology); structural model	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL; CAUSAL INFERENCE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; DEFINITION; MORTALITY; KNOWLEDGE; RATIO; BIAS	According to the authors, time-modified confounding occurs when the causal relation between a time-fixed or time-varying confounder and the treatment or outcome changes over time. A key difference between previously described time-varying confounding and the proposed time-modified confounding is that, in the former, the values of the confounding variable change over time while, in the latter, the effects of the confounder change over time. Using marginal structural models, the authors propose an approach to account for time-modified confounding when the relation between the confounder and treatment is modified over time. An illustrative example and simulation show that, when time-modified confounding is present, a marginal structural model with inverse probability-of-treatment weights specified to account for time-modified confounding remains approximately unbiased with appropriate confidence limit coverage, while models that do not account for time-modified confounding are biased. Correct specification of the treatment model, including accounting for potential variation over time in confounding, is an important assumption of marginal structural models. When the effect of confounders on either the treatment or outcome changes over time, time-modified confounding should be considered.

Comparison of strategies for scalable causal discovery of latent variable models from mixed data	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DATA SCIENCE AND ANALYTICS			English	Article						Causal inference; Latent variables; Mixed data; COPD; HIV	SELECTION; DISCRETE	Modern technologies allow large, complex biomedical datasets to be collected from patient cohorts. These datasets are comprised of both continuous and categorical data ("Mixed Data"), and essential variables may be unobserved in this data due to the complex nature of biomedical phenomena. Causal inference algorithms can identify important relationships from biomedical data; however, handling the challenges of causal inference over mixed data with unmeasured confounders in a scalable way is still an open problem. Despite recent advances into causal discovery strategies that could potentially handle these challenges; individually, no study currently exists that comprehensively compares these approaches in this setting. In this paper, we present a comparative study that addresses this problem by comparing the accuracy and efficiency of different strategies in large, mixed datasets with latent confounders. We experiment with two extensions of the Fast Causal Inference algorithm: a maximum probability search procedure we recently developed to identify causal orientations more accurately, and a strategy which quickly eliminates unlikely adjacencies in order to achieve scalability to high-dimensional data. We demonstrate that these methods significantly outperform the state of the art in the field by achieving both accurate edge orientations and tractable running time in simulation experiments on datasets with up to 500 variables. Finally, we demonstrate the usability of the best performing approach on real data by applying it to a biomedical dataset of HIV-infected individuals.

J	Cai, XZ; Zhu, YY; Huang, Y; Ghosh, D				Cai, Xizhen; Zhu, Yeying; Huang, Yuan; Ghosh, Debashis			High-dimensional causal mediation analysis based on partial linear structural equation models	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Adaptive LASSO; Causal inference; Confounding; High-dimensional mediators	VARIABLE SELECTION; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; ADAPTIVE LASSO; IDENTIFICATION; MODERATORS; INFERENCE	Causal mediation analysis has become popular in recent years. The goal of mediation analyses is to learn the direct effects of exposure on outcome as well as mediated effects on the pathway from exposure to outcome. A set of generalized structural equations to estimate the direct and indirect effects for mediation analysis is proposed when the number of mediators is of high-dimensionality. Specifically, a two-step procedure is considered where the penalization framework can be adopted to perform variable selection. A partial linear model is used to account for a nonlinear relationship among pre-treatment confounders and the response variable in each model. Procedures for estimating the coefficients for the treatment and the mediators in the structural models are developed. The obtained estimators can be interpreted as causal effects without imposing a linear assumption on the model structure. The performance of Sobel's method in obtaining the standard error and confidence interval for the estimated joint indirect effect is also evaluated in simulation studies. Simulation results show a superior performance of the proposed method.

Therefore, causal inference regarding the treatment effect is not as straightforward as in a randomized trial. To adjust for confounding due to measured covariates, a variety of methods based on the potential outcomes framework are used to estimate average treatment effects. One of the key assumptions is treatment positivity, which states that the probability of treatment is bounded away from zero and one for any possible combination of the confounders. Methods for performing causal inference when this assumption is violated are relatively limited. In this article, we discuss a new balance-related condition involving the convex hulls of treatment groups, which I term relaxed covariate overlap. An advantage of this concept is that it can be linked to a concept from machine learning, termed the margin. Introduction of relaxed covariate overlap leads to an approach in which one can perform causal inference in a three-step manner. The methodology is illustrated with two examples.

Multiply robust causal inference with double-negative control adjustment for categorical unmeasured confounding	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Causal inference; Negative control; Semiparametric inference; Unmeasured confounding	CONTROL EXPOSURES; TIME-SERIES; BIAS	Unmeasured confounding is a threat to causal inference in observational studies. In recent years, the use of negative controls to mitigate unmeasured confounding has gained increasing recognition and popularity. Negative controls have a long-standing tradition in laboratory sciences and epidemiology to rule out non-causal explanations, although they have been used primarily for bias detection. Recently, Miao and colleagues have described sufficient conditions under which a pair of negative control exposure and outcome variables can be used to identify non-parametrically the average treatment effect (ATE) from observational data subject to uncontrolled confounding. We establish non-parametric identification of the ATE under weaker conditions in the case of categorical unmeasured confounding and negative control variables. We also provide a general semiparametric framework for obtaining inferences about the ATE while leveraging information about a possibly large number of measured covariates. In particular, we derive the semiparametric efficiency bound in the non-parametric model, and we propose multiply robust and locally efficient estimators when non-parametric estimation may not be feasible. We assess the finite sample performance of our methods in extensive simulation studies. Finally, we illustrate our methods with an application to the post-licensure surveillance of vaccine safety among children.

The authors evaluated whether hd-PS maintains its capabilities in small cohorts that have few exposed patients or few outcome events. In 4 North American pharmacoepidemiologic cohort studies between 1995 and 2005, the authors repeatedly sampled the data to yield increasingly smaller cohorts. They identified potential confounders in each sample and estimated both an hd-PS that included 0-500 covariates and treatment effects adjusted by decile of hd-PS. For sensitivity analyses, they altered the variable selection process to use zero-cell correction and, separately, to use only the variables' exposure association. With >50 exposed patients with an outcome event, hd-PS-adjusted point estimates in the small cohorts were similar to the full-cohort values. With 25-50 exposed events, both sensitivity analyses yielded estimates closer to those obtained in the full data set. Point estimates generally did not change as compared with the full data set when selecting >300 covariates for the hd-PS. In these data, using zero-cell correction or exposure-based covariate selection allowed hd-PS to function robustly with few events. hd-PS is a flexible analytical tool for nonrandomized research across a range of study sizes and event frequencies.

Although the principles behind confounder selection are now well established, variable selection for confounder adjustment remains a difficult problem in practice, particularly in secondary analyses of databases. We present a simulation study that compares the high-dimensional propensity score algorithm for variable selection with approaches that utilize direct adjustment for all potential confounders via regularized regression, including ridge regression and lasso regression. Simulations were based on 2 previously published pharmacoepidemiologic cohorts and used the plasmode simulation framework to create realistic simulated data sets with thousands of potential confounders. Performance of methods was evaluated with respect to bias and mean squared error of the estimated effects of a binary treatment. Simulation scenarios varied the true underlying outcome model, treatment effect, prevalence of exposure and outcome, and presence of unmeasured confounding. Across scenarios, high-dimensional propensity score approaches generally performed better than regularized regression approaches. However, including the variables selected by lasso regression in a regular propensity score model also performed well and may provide a promising alternative variable selection method.

Effects of Adjusting for Instrumental Variables on Bias and Precision of Effect Estimates	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						bias (epidemiology); confounding factors (epidemiology); epidemiologic methods; instrumental variable; precision; simulation; variable selection	TREATMENT SELECTION BIAS; PROPENSITY SCORE MODELS; OBSERVATIONAL DATA; CAUSAL INFERENCE; SUBCLASSIFICATION; ADJUSTMENT; EFFICIENCY; BALANCE	Recent theoretical studies have shown that conditioning on an instrumental variable (IV), a variable that is associated with exposure but not associated with outcome except through exposure, can increase both bias and variance of exposure effect estimates. Although these findings have obvious implications in cases of known IVs, their meaning remains unclear in the more common scenario where investigators are uncertain whether a measured covariate meets the criteria for an IV or rather a confounder. The authors present results from two simulation studies designed to provide insight into the problem of conditioning on potential IVs in routine epidemiologic practice. The simulations explored the effects of conditioning on IVs, near-IVs (predictors of exposure that are weakly associated with outcome), and confounders on the bias and variance of a binary exposure effect estimate. The results indicate that effect estimates which are conditional on a perfect IV or near-IV may have larger bias and variance than the unconditional estimate. However, in most scenarios considered, the increases in error due to conditioning were small compared with the total estimation error. In these cases, minimizing unmeasured confounding should be the priority when selecting variables for adjustment, even at the risk of conditioning on IVs.

Causal feature selection using a knowledge graph combining structured knowledge from the biomedical literature and ontologies: A use case studying depression as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Knowledge representation; management; or engineering; Knowledge graphs; Causal modeling; Feature selection; Alzheimer's disease; Depression	COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; BIAS; DEMENTIA; SYMPTOMS; ANEMIA; ASSOCIATION; INFERENCE; STROKE; MODELS	Background: Causal feature selection is essential for estimating effects from observational data. Identifying confounders is a crucial step in this process. Traditionally, researchers employ content-matter expertise and literature review to identify confounders. Uncontrolled confounding from unidentified confounders threatens validity, conditioning on intermediate variables (mediators) weakens estimates, and conditioning on common effects (colliders) induces bias. Additionally, without special treatment, erroneous conditioning on variables combining roles introduces bias. However, the vast literature is growing exponentially, making it infeasible to assimilate this knowledge. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel knowledge graph (KG) application enabling causal feature selection by combining computable literature-derived knowledge with biomedical on-tologies. We present a use case of our approach specifying a causal model for estimating the total causal effect of depression on the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) from observational data. Methods: We extracted computable knowledge from a literature corpus using three machine reading systems and inferred missing knowledge using logical closure operations. Using a KG framework, we mapped the output to target terminologies and combined it with ontology-grounded resources. We translated epidemiological defini-tions of confounder, collider, and mediator into queries for searching the KG and summarized the roles played by the identified variables. We compared the results with output from a complementary method and published observational studies and examined a selection of confounding and combined role variables in-depth.Results: Our search identified 128 confounders, including 58 phenotypes, 47 drugs, 35 genes, 23 collider, and 16 mediator phenotypes. However, only 31 of the 58 confounder phenotypes were found to behave exclusively as confounders, while the remaining 27 phenotypes played other roles. Obstructive sleep apnea emerged as a po-tential novel confounder for depression and AD. Anemia exemplified a variable playing combined roles. Conclusion: Our findings suggest combining machine reading and KG could augment human expertise for causal feature selection. However, the complexity of causal feature selection for depression with AD highlights the need for standardized field-specific databases of causal variables. Further work is needed to optimize KG search and transform the output for human consumption.

These difficulties are especially relevant in research on racial and ethnic disparities and neuropsychological outcomes because of the particular influence of selection and measurement in these contexts. In this article, we review the counterfactual framework for thinking about causal effects versus statistical associations. We emphasize that causal inferences are key to predicting the likely consequences of possible interventions, for example in clinical settings. We summarize a number of common biases that can obscure causal relationships, including confounding, measurement ceilings/floors, baseline adjustment bias, practice or retest effects, differential measurement error, conditioning on common effects in direct and indirect effects decompositions, and differential survival. For each, we describe how to recognize when such biases may be relevant and some possible analytic or design approaches to remediating these biases.	[Glymour, M.

Such models arise in various situations: when detailed exposure measurements are combined with variables that can be used to assign exposures to unmeasured subjects; when biomarkers are obtained to assess an unobserved pathophysiologic process; or when additional information is to be obtained on confounding or modifying variables. In such situations, it may be possible to stratify the subsample on data available for all subjects in the main study, such as outcomes, exposure predictors, or geographic locations. Three circumstances where analytic calculations of the optimal design are possible are considered: (i) when all variables are binary; (ii) when all are normally distributed; and (iii) when the latent variable and its measurement are normally distributed, but the outcome is binary. In each of these cases, it is often possible to considerably improve the cost efficiency of the design by appropriate selection of the sampling fractions. More complex situations arise when the data are spatially distributed: the spatial correlation can be exploited to improve exposure assignment for unmeasured locations using available measurements on neighboring locations; some approaches for informative selection of the measurement sample using location and/or exposure predictor data are considered.

Simultaneous adjustment of uncontrolled confounding, selection bias and misclassification in multiple-bias modelling	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Multi-bias modelling; confounding; information bias; selection bias; parameters; imputed; regression weight; mis-specification; simulation	REAL-WORLD EVIDENCE; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; CAUSAL DIAGRAMS; FORMULAS	Background Adjusting for multiple biases usually involves adjusting for one bias at a time, with careful attention to the order in which these biases are adjusted. A novel, alternative approach to multiple-bias adjustment involves the simultaneous adjustment of all biases via imputation and/or regression weighting. The imputed value or weight corresponds to the probability of the missing data and serves to 'reconstruct' the unbiased data that would be observed based on the provided assumptions of the degree of bias. Methods We motivate and describe the steps necessary to implement this method. We also demonstrate the validity of this method through a simulation study with an exposure-outcome relationship that is biased by uncontrolled confounding, exposure misclassification, and selection bias. Results The study revealed that a non-biased effect estimate can be obtained when correct bias parameters are applied. It also found that incorrect specification of every bias parameter by +/-25% still produced an effect estimate with less bias than the observed, biased effect. Conclusions Simultaneous multi-bias analysis is a useful way of investigating and understanding how multiple sources of bias may affect naive effect estimates. This new method can be used to enhance the validity and transparency of real-world evidence obtained from observational, longitudinal studies.

In the presence of structural confounding, certain covariate strata will contain only subjects who could never be exposed, a violation of the positivity or experimental treatment effect assumption. Thus, structural confounding can prohibit the exchangeability necessary for meaningful causal contrasts across levels of exposure. The authors explored the presence and magnitude of structural confounding by estimating the independent effects of neighborhood deprivation and neighborhood racial composition (segregation) on rates of preterm birth in Wake and Durham counties, North Carolina (1999-2001). Tabular analyses and random-intercept fixed-slope multilevel logistic models portrayed different structural realities in these counties. The multilevel modeling results suggested some nonsignificant effect of residence in tracts with high levels of socioeconomic deprivation or racial residential segregation on adjusted odds of preterm birth for white and black women living in these counties, and the confidence limit ratios indicated fairly consistent levels of precision around the estimates. The results of the tabular analysis, however, suggested that many of these regression modeling findings were off-support and based on no actual data. The implications for statistical and public health inference, in the presence of no data, are considered.

In this article, we develop theory for causal effects defined with respect to a different type of intervention, one which alters the information propagated through the edges of the graph. These information transfer interventions may be more useful than node interventions in settings in which causes are non-manipulable, for example when considering race or genetics as a causes. Furthermore, information transfer interventions allow us to define path-specific decompositions which are identified in the presence of treatment-induced mediator-outcome confounding, a practical problem whose general solution remains elusive. We prove that the proposed effects provide valid statistical tests of mechanisms, unlike popular methods based on randomised interventions on the mediator. We propose efficient non-parametric estimators for a covariance version of the proposed effects, using data-adaptive regression coupled with semi-parametric efficiency theory to address model misspecification bias while retaining n-consistency and asymptotic normality. We illustrate the use of our methods in two examples using publicly available data.

Causal Knowledge as a Prerequisite for Interrogating Bias: Reflections on Hernan et al. 20 Years Later	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Editorial Material						causal inference; collider bias; confounding; selection bias	SELECTION BIAS; STRUCTURAL APPROACH; HISTORY	In their seminal 2002 paper, "Causal Knowledge as a Prerequisite for Confounding Evaluation: An Application to Birth Defects Epidemiology," Hernan et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2002;155(2):176-184) emphasized the importance of using theory rather than data to guide confounding control, focusing on colliders as variables that share characteristics with confounders but whose control may actually introduce bias into analyses. In this commentary, we propose that the importance of this paper stems from the connection the authors made between nonexchangeability as the ultimate source of bias and structural representations of bias using directed acyclic graphs. This provided both a unified approach to conceptualizing bias and a means of distinguishing between different sources of bias, particularly confounding and selection bias. Drawing on examples from the paper, we also highlight unresolved questions about the relationship between collider bias, selection bias, and generalizability and argue that causal knowledge is a prerequisite not only for identifying confounders but also for developing any hypothesis about potential sources of bias.

A crucial source of violation of the internal validity of a study involves bias arising from confounding, which is always a challenge in observational research, including life course epidemiology. The increasingly popular approach of meta-analyzing individual participant data from several observational studies also brings up to discussion the problem of confounding when combining data from different populations. In this study, we review and discuss the most common sources of confounding in life course epidemiology: (i) confounding by indication, (ii) impact of baseline selection on confounding, (iii) time-varying confounding and (iv) mediator-outcome confounding. We also discuss the issue of addressing confounding in the context of an individual participant data meta-analysis.

The matching process generally forces certain variables to be independent despite their being connected in the causal diagram, a phenomenon known as unfaithfulness. We show how causal diagrams can be used to visualize many previous results about matched studies. Cohort matching can prevent confounding by the matched variables, but censoring or other missing data and further adjustment may necessitate control of matching variables. Case-control matching generally does not prevent confounding by the matched variables, and control of matching variables may be necessary even if those were not confounders initially. Matching on variables that are affected by the exposure and the outcome, or intermediates between the exposure and the outcome, will ordinarily produce irremediable bias.

James			Time dependent hazard ratio estimation using instrumental variables without conditioning on an omitted covariate	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Causal inference; Censoring; Semi-parametric model; Marginal model		Background Estimation that employs instrumental variables (IV) can reduce or eliminate bias due to confounding. In observational studies, instruments result from natural experiments such as the effect of clinician preference or geographic distance on treatment selection. In randomized studies the randomization indicator is typically a valid instrument, especially if the study is blinded, e.g. no placebo effect. Estimation via instruments is a highly developed field for linear models but the use of instruments in time-to-event analysis is far from established. Various IV-based estimators of the hazard ratio (HR) from Cox's regression models have been proposed. Methods We extend IV based estimation of Cox's model beyond proportionality of hazards, and address estimation of a log-linear time dependent hazard ratio and a piecewise constant HR. We estimate the marginal time-dependent hazard ratio unlike other approaches that estimate the hazard ratio conditional on the omitted covariates. We use estimating equations motivated by Martingale representations that resemble the partial likelihood score statistic. We conducted simulations that include the use of copulas to generate potential times-to-event that have a given marginal structural time dependent hazard ratio but are dependent on omitted covariates. We compare our approach to the partial likelihood estimator, and two other IV based approaches. We apply it to estimation of the time dependent hazard ratio for two vascular interventions. Results The method performs well in simulations of a stepwise time-dependent hazard ratio, but illustrates some bias that increases as the hazard ratio moves away from unity (the value that typically underlies the null hypothesis). It compares well to other approaches when the hazard ratio is stepwise constant. It also performs well for estimation of a log-linear hazard ratio where no other instrumental variable approaches exist. Conclusion The estimating equations we propose for estimating a time-dependent hazard ratio using an IV perform well in simulations. We encourage the use of our procedure for time-dependent hazard ratio estimation when unmeasured confounding is a concern and a suitable instrumental variable exists.

Universal Difference-in-Differences for Causal Inference in Epidemiology	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Difference-in-differences; Equi-confounding; Odds ratios; Selection bias; Generalized linear models; Extended propensity score	DOUBLY ROBUST ESTIMATION; PROPENSITY SCORE	Difference-in-differences is undoubtedly one of the most widely used methods for evaluating the causal effect of an intervention in observational (i.e., nonrandomized) settings. The approach is typically used when pre- and postexposure outcome measurements are available, and one can reasonably assume that the association of the unobserved confounder with the outcome has the same absolute magnitude in the two exposure arms and is constant over time; a so-called parallel trends assumption. The parallel trends assumption may not be credible in many practical settings, for example, if the outcome is binary, a count, or polytomous, as well as when an uncontrolled confounder exhibits nonadditive effects on the distribution of the outcome, even if such effects are constant over time. We introduce an alternative approach that replaces the parallel trends assumption with an odds ratio equi-confounding assumption under which an association between treatment and the potential outcome under no treatment is identified with a well-specified generalized linear model relating the pre-exposure outcome and the exposure. Because the proposed method identifies any causal effect that is conceivably identified in the absence of confounding bias, including nonlinear effects such as quantile treatment effects, the approach is aptly called universal difference-in-differences. We describe and illustrate both fully parametric and more robust semiparametric universal difference-in-differences estimators in a real-world application concerning the causal effects of a Zika virus outbreak on birth rate in Brazil.A supplementary digital video is available at: http://links.lww.com/EDE/C90	[Tchetgen, Eric J.

Methods We propose an approach based on transformation and fractional polynomials which yields simple regression models with interpretable curves. We suggest a way of presenting the results from such models which involves tabulating the risks estimated from the model at convenient values of the risk factor. We discuss how to incorporate several continuous risk and confounding variables within a single model. The approach is exemplified with data from the Whitehall I study of British Civil Servants. We discuss the approach in relation to categorization and non-parametric regression models. Results We show that non-linear risk models fit the data better than linear models. We discuss the difficulties introduced by categorization and the advantages of the new approach. Conclusions Our approach based on fractional polynomials should be considered as an important alternative to the traditional approaches for the analysis of continuous variables in epidemiological studies.

J	Antonelli, J; Zigler, C; Dominici, F				Antonelli, Joseph; Zigler, Corwin; Dominici, Francesca			Guided Bayesian imputation to adjust for confounding when combining heterogeneous data sources in comparative effectiveness research	BIOSTATISTICS			English	Article						Bayesian data augmentation; Model averaging; Missing data; Bayesian adjustment for confounding; Confounder selection	SEER-MEDICARE DATA; PROPENSITY SCORE; MODEL SELECTION; VALIDATION DATA; REGRESSION; UNCERTAINTY; PARAMETERS; BINARY	In comparative effectiveness research, we are often interested in the estimation of an average causal effect from large observational data (the main study). Often this data does not measure all the necessary confounders. In many occasions, an extensive set of additional covariates is measured for a smaller and non-representative population (the validation study). In this setting, standard approaches for missing data imputation might not be adequate due to the large number of missing covariates in the main data relative to the smaller sample size of the validation data. We propose a Bayesian approach to estimate the average causal effect in the main study that borrows information from the validation study to improve confounding adjustment. Our approach combines ideas of Bayesian model averaging, confounder selection, and missing data imputation into a single framework. It allows for different treatment effects in the main study and in the validation study, and propagates the uncertainty due to the missing data imputation and confounder selection when estimating the average causal effect (ACE) in the main study. We compare our method to several existing approaches via simulation. We apply our method to a study examining the effect of surgical resection on survival among 10 396 Medicare beneficiaries with a brain tumor when additional covariate information is available on 2220 patients in SEER-Medicare. We find that the estimated ACE decreases by 30% when incorporating additional information from SEER-Medicare.

Constructing inverse probability weights for marginal structural models	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						bias (epidemiology); causality; confounding factors (epidemiology); probability weighting; regression model	ACTIVE ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; LONG-TERM EFFECTIVENESS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; HIV-INFECTION; SURVIVAL; TIME; SELECTION; INTERVENTIONS; ZIDOVUDINE; MORTALITY	The method of inverse probability weighting (henceforth, weighting) can be used to adjust for measured confounding and selection bias under the four assumptions of consistency, exchangeability, positivity, and no misspecification of the model used to estimate weights. In recent years, several published estimates of the effect of time-varying exposures have been based on weighted estimation of the parameters of marginal structural models because, unlike standard statistical methods, weighting can appropriately adjust for measured time-varying confounders affected by prior exposure. As an example, the authors describe the last three assumptions using the change in viral load due to initiation of antiretroviral therapy among 918 human immunodeficiency virus-infected US men and women followed for a median of 5.8 years between 1996 and 2005. The authors describe possible tradeoffs that an epidemiologist may encounter when attempting to make inferences. For instance, a tradeoff between bias and precision is illustrated as a function of the extent to which confounding is controlled. Weight truncation is presented as an informal and easily implemented method to deal with these tradeoffs. Inverse probability weighting provides a powerful methodological tool that may uncover causal effects of exposures that are otherwise obscured. However, as with all methods, diagnostics and sensitivity analyses are essential for proper use.

Alan			Bias testing, bias correction, and confounder selection using an instrumental variable model	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						bias correction; bias equivalence; confounding bias; instrumental variable; ordinary least squares	REGRESSION	Instrumental variable (IV) analysis can be used to address bias due to unobserved confounding when estimating the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome of interest. However, if a proposed IV is correlated with unmeasured confounders and/or weakly correlated with the treatment, the standard IV estimator may be more biased than an ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator. Several methods have been proposed that compare the bias of the IV and OLS estimators relying on the belief that measured covariates can be used as proxies for the unmeasured confounder. Despite these developments, there is lack of discussion about approaches that can be used to formally test whether the IV estimator may be less biased than the OLS estimator. Thus, we have developed a testing framework to compare the bias and a criterion to select informative measured covariates for bias comparison and regression adjustment. We also have developed a bias-correction method, which allows one to use an invalid IV to correct the bias of the OLS or IV estimator. Numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed methods perform well with realistic sample sizes.

The utility of ensemble procedures for causal adjustment	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						average treatment effect; confounding; covariate balance; inverse probability weighting; matching; propensity score; Super Learner	MISSPECIFICATION; ROBUSTNESS; ESTIMATORS; SELECTION	In investigations of the effect of treatment on outcome, the propensity score is a tool to eliminate imbalance in the distribution of confounding variables between treatment groups. Recent work has suggested that Super Learner, an ensemble method, outperforms logistic regression in nonlinear settings; however, experience with real-data analyses tends to show overfitting of the propensity score model using this approach. We investigated a wide range of simulated settings of varying complexities including simulations based on real data to compare the performances of logistic regression, generalized boosted models, and Super Learner in providing balance and for estimating the average treatment effect via propensity score regression, propensity score matching, and inverse probability of treatment weighting. We found that Super Learner and logistic regression are comparable in terms of covariate balance, bias, and mean squared error (MSE); however, Super Learner is computationally very expensive thus leaving no clear advantage to the more complex approach. Propensity scores estimated by generalized boosted models were inferior to the other two estimation approaches. We also found that propensity score regression adjustment was superior to either matching or inverse weighting when the form of the dependence on the treatment on the outcome is correctly specified.

Patients' characteristics can affect the exposure (confounding) as well as the timing of routine visits (measurement process), and those characteristics may be altered following a visit which can create dependencies between the monitoring and body mass index when viewed as a stochastic or random processes in time. This may result in a form of selection bias that distorts the estimation of the marginal effect of the antidepressant. Inverse intensity of visit weights have been proposed to adjust for these imbalances, however no approaches have addressed complex settings where the covariate and the monitoring processes affect each other in time so as to induce endogeneity, a situation likely to occur in electronic health records. We review how selection bias due to outcome-dependent follow-up times may arise and propose a new cumulated weight that models a complete monitoring path so as to address the above-mentioned challenges and produce a reliable estimate of the impact of antide-pressants on body mass index. More specifically, we do so using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink in the United Kingdom, comparing the marginal effect of two commonly used antidepressants, citalopram and fluoxetine, on body mass index. The results are compared to those obtained with simpler methods that do not account for the extent of the dependence due to an endogenous covariate process.	[Coulombe, Janie; Moodie, Erica E.

MSMs are powerful tools for assessing causality with complicated, longitudinal data sets but have not been widely used by practitioners. The objective of this paper is to illustrate the fitting of an MSM for the causal effect of iron supplement use during pregnancy (time-varying treatment) on odds of anemia at delivery in the presence of time-dependent confounding. Data from pregnant women enrolled in the Iron Supplementation Study (Raleigh, North Carolina, 1997-1999) were used. The authors highlight complexities of MSMs and key issues epidemiologists should recognize before and while undertaking an analysis with these methods and show how such methods can be readily interpreted in existing software packages, including SAS and Stata. The authors emphasize that if a data set with rich information on confounders is available, MSMs can be used straightforwardly to make robust inferences about causal effects of time-dependent treatments/exposures in epidemiologic research.

However, there are concerns about approaches that select a model based on a given data set, and then estimate health effects in the same data. This can create problems when (1) the sample size is small in relation to the magnitude of the health effects; and (2) candidate predictors are highly correlated and likely to have similar effects. Bayesian Model Averaging has been advocated as a way to estimate health effects that accounts for model uncertainty. However, implementations where posterior model probabilities are approximated using BIC, as well as other default choices, may not reflect the ability of each model to provide an estimate of the health effect that is properly adjusted for confounding. Air pollution studies need to focus on estimating health effects while accounting for the uncertainty in the adjustment for confounding factors. This is true especially when model choice and estimation are performed on the same data. The development of appropriate statistical tools remains an open area of investigation.

The latter is especially true when targeting the causal effect of a time-varying exposure in a longitudinal study. Marginal structural models are a relatively new class of causal models that effectively deal with the estimation of the effects of time-varying exposures. Marginal structural models have traditionally been embedded in the counterfactual framework to causal inference. In this paper, we use the causal graph framework to enhance the implementation of marginal structural models. We illustrate our approach using data from a prospective cohort study, the Honolulu Heart Program. These data consist of 8006 men at baseline. To illustrate our approach, we focused on the estimation of the causal effect of physical activity on blood pressure, which were measured at three time points. First, a causal graph is built to encompass prior knowledge. This graph is then validated and improved utilizing structural equation models. We estimated the aforementioned causal effect using marginal structural models for repeated measures and guided the implementation of the models with the causal graph. By employing the causal graph framework, we also show the validity of fitting conditional marginal structural models for repeated measures in the context implied by our data.

J	Cox, LA				(Tony) Cox, Louis Anthony, Jr.			Why Reduced-Form Regression Models of Health Effects Versus Exposures Should Not Replace QRA: Livestock Production and Infant Mortality as an Example	RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article						Animal feeding operations; causal analysis; health risk analysis; infant mortality rates; spurious regression	ECOLOGIC FALLACY; RISK	Do pollution emissions from livestock operations increase infant mortality rate (IMR)? A recent regression analysis of changes in IMR against changes in aggregate "animal units" (a weighted sum of cattle, pig, and poultry numbers) over time, for counties throughout the United States, suggested the provocative conclusion that they do: "[A] doubling of production leads to a 7.4% increase in infant mortality." Yet, we find that regressing IMR changes against changes in specific components of "animal units" (cattle, pigs, and broilers) at the state level reveals statistically significant negative associations between changes in livestock production (especially, cattle production) and changes in IMR. We conclude that statistical associations between livestock variables and IMR variables are very sensitive to modeling choices (e.g., selection of explanatory variables, and use of specific animal types vs. aggregate "animal units). Such associations, whether positive or negative, do not warrant causal interpretation. We suggest that standard methods of quantitative risk assessment (QRA), including emissions release (source) models, fate and transport modeling, exposure assessment, and dose-response modeling, really are important-and indeed, perhaps, essential-for drawing valid causal inferences about health effects of exposures to guide sound, well-informed public health risk management policy. Reduced-form regression models, which skip most or all of these steps, can only quantify statistical associations (which may be due to model specification, variable selection, residual confounding, or other noncausal factors). Sound risk management requires the extra work needed to identify and model valid causal relations.

Ecologic analyses may avoid confounding that would be present in analysis at the individual level because variations in regional or hospital practice may be unrelated to prognosis. The authors used simulated data with. an excluded confounder to evaluate the reliability and limitations of the grouped-treatment approach, a method of incorporating an ecologic measure of treatment assignment into an individual-level multivariable model, similar to the instrumental variable approach. Estimates based on the grouped-treatment approach were closer to:the true value than those of standard individual-level multivariable analysis in every simulation. Furthermore, confidence intervals based on the grouped-treatment approach achieved approximately their nominal coverage, whereas those based on individual-level analyses did not. The grouped-treatment approach appears to be more reliable than standard individual-level analysis in situations where the grouped-treatment variable is unassociated with the outcome except via the actual treatment assignment and measured covariates.

We describe examples of selection bias in case-control studies (eg, inappropriate selection of controls) and cohort studies (eg, informative censoring). We argue that the causal structure underlying the bias in each example is essentially the same: conditioning on a common effect of 2 variables, one of which is either exposure or a cause of exposure and the other is either the outcome or a cause of the outcome. This structure is shared by other biases (eg, adjustment for variables affected by prior exposure). A structural classification of bias distinguishes between biases resulting from conditioning on common effects ("selection bias") and those resulting from the existence of common causes of exposure and outcome ("confounding"). This classification also leads to a unified approach to adjust for selection bias.

If the number of covariates is large relative to the number of observations, then controlling for all available covariates is infeasible. In cases where a sparsity condition holds, variable selection or penalization can reduce the dimension of the covariate space in a manner that allows for valid estimation of treatment effects. In this article, we propose matching on both the estimated propensity score and the estimated prognostic scores when the number of covariates is large relative to the number of observations. We derive asymptotic results for the matching estimator and show that it is doubly robust in the sense that only one of the two score models need be correct to obtain a consistent estimator. We show via simulation its effectiveness in controlling for confounding and highlight its potential to address nonlinear confounding. Finally, we apply the proposed procedure to analyze the effect of gender on prescription opioid use using insurance claims data.

Joseph			Inferring causality from observational studies: the role of instrumental variable analysis	KIDNEY INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						causal inference; confounding; instrumental variable; statistical methods	GENERALIZED-METHOD; WEAK INSTRUMENTS; SURVIVAL; HAZARDS; MODELS; TIME; BIAS	Inferring causality from observational studies can be challenging because of the perennial threat of biases from selection, measurement, and confounding. The gold standard study design in clinical research is the randomized controlled trial, because random allocation to treatment ensures that, on average, comparison groups are balanced with respect to both known and unknown prognostic factors. However, most clinically relevant exposureoutcome relationships are not amendable (logistically or ethically) to randomization. Thus, there has been an emergence of analytical approaches over the last several years to improve the validity of inferences made from observational studies. This review presents such an approach, instrumental variable analysis, a technique that has been used by economists for many years but has only recently seen increasing use in the health care literature. This review provides a description of the method, the assumptions underlying it, and recent applications in nephrology outcomes research. A more detailed review of the underlying mathematics, properties of an instrumental variable, and suggested elements for reporting an instrumental variable analysis are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.

Two-stage instrumental variable methods for estimating the causal odds ratio: Analysis of bias	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						instrumental variable; two-stage residual inclusion; two-stage predictor substitution; logistic regression; bias	PRINCIPAL STRATIFICATION; PRESCRIBING PREFERENCE; RANDOMIZED TREATMENT; POTENTIAL OUTCOMES; LOGISTIC-MODELS; INFERENCE; NONCOMPLIANCE; SELECTION; EFFICACY; DEATH	We present closed-form expressions of asymptotic bias for the causal odds ratio from two estimation approaches of instrumental variable logistic regression: (i) the two-stage predictor substitution (2SPS) method and (ii) the two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI) approach. Under the 2SPS approach, the first stage model yields the predicted value of treatment as a function of an instrument and covariates, and in the second stage model for the outcome, this predicted value replaces the observed value of treatment as a covariate. Under the 2SRI approach, the first stage is the same, but the residual term of the first stage regression is included in the second stage regression, retaining the observed treatment as a covariate. Our bias assessment is for a different context from that of Terza (J. Health Econ. 2008; 27(3): 531-543), who focused on the causal odds ratio conditional on the unmeasured confounder, whereas we focus on the causal odds ratio among compliers under the principal stratification framework. Our closed-form bias results show that the 2SPS logistic regression generates asymptotically biased estimates of this causal odds ratio when there is no unmeasured confounding and that this bias increases with increasing unmeasured confounding. The 2SRI logistic regression is asymptotically unbiased when there is no unmeasured confounding, but when there is unmeasured confounding, there is bias and it increases with increasing unmeasured confounding. The closed-form bias results provide guidance for using these IV logistic regression methods. Our simulation results are consistent with our closed-form analytic results under different combinations of parameter settings. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Whereas standard analysis usually is conducted as if the confounders were known a priori, selection uncertainty also must be taken into account. METHODS: Confounders were selected by using backward elimination (BE), change in estimate (CIE) method, Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and an empirical approach using a priori information. A modified ridge regression estimator, which shrinks effects of confounders toward zero, also was considered. For each criterion, uncertainty in the estimated exposure effect was assessed by using bootstrap simulations for which confounders were selected in each sample. These methods were illustrated by using data for mercury neurotoxicity in Faroe Islands children. Point estimates and standard errors of mercury effects on confounder-sensitive neurobehavioral outcomes were calculated for each selection procedure. RESULTS: The full model and the empirical a priori model showed approximately the same precision, and these methods were (slightly) inferior to only modified ridge regression. Lower precisions were obtained by using BE with a low cutoff level, BIC, and CIE. CONCLUSIONS: Standard analysis ignores model selection uncertainty and is likely to yield overoptimistic inferences. Thus, the traditional BE procedure with p = 5% should be avoided. If data-dependent procedures are required for confounder identification, we recommend that inferences be based on bootstrap statistics to describe the selection process.

The goal of introducing IV is to remove the effects of unobserved factors that may confound the relationship between the biomarkers and the outcome. A valid inference under the IV framework requires pairwise associations and pathway exclusivity. Among these assumptions, the IV expression association needs to be strong for the casual effect estimates to be unbiased. However, a small number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) often provide limited explanation of the variability in the gene or protein expression and can only serve as weak IVs. In this study, we propose to replace SNPs with haplotypes as IVs to increase the variant-expression association and thus improve the casual effect inference of the expression. In the classical two-stage procedure, we developed a haplotype regression model combined with a model selection procedure to identify optimal instruments. The performance of the new method was evaluated through simulations and compared with the IV approaches using observed multiple SNPs. Our results showed the gain of power to detect a causal effect of gene or protein on the outcome using haplotypes compared with using only observed SNPs, under either complete or missing genotype scenarios.

This was a review of the application of simulation methods to the quantification of bias in reproductive and perina-tal epidemiology and an assessment of value gained. Methods: A search of published studies available in English was conducted in August 2020 using PubMed, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Scopus. A gray literature search of Google and Google Scholar, and a hand search using the reference lists of included studies was undertaken. Results: Thirty-nine papers were included in this study, covering information ( n = 14), selection ( n = 14), confounding ( n = 9), protection ( n = 1), and attenuation bias ( n = 1). The methods of simulating data and reporting of results varied, with more recent studies including causal diagrams. Few studies included code for replication. Conclusions: Although there has been an increasing application of simulation in reproductive and peri-natal epidemiology since 2015, overall this remains an underexplored area. Further effort s are required to increase knowledge of how the application of simulation can quantify the influence of bias, includ-ing improved design, analysis and reporting. This will improve causal interpretation in reproductive and perinatal studies. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Unifying instrumental variable and inverse probability weighting approaches for inference of causal treatment effect and unmeasured confounding in observational studies	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Causal treatment effect; identification bounds; instrumental variable; inverse probability weighting; unmeasured confounding	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; PRINCIPAL STRATIFICATION; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; PROPENSITY SCORE; BOUNDS; IDENTIFICATION; REGRESSION; DESIGN; TRIALS; COHORT	Confounding is a major concern when using data from observational studies to infer the causal effect of a treatment. Instrumental variables, when available, have been used to construct bound estimates on population average treatment effects when outcomes are binary and unmeasured confounding exists. With continuous outcomes, meaningful bounds are more challenging to obtain because the domain of the outcome is unrestricted. In this paper, we propose to unify the instrumental variable and inverse probability weighting methods, together with suitable assumptions in the context of an observational study, to construct meaningful bounds on causal treatment effects. The contextual assumptions are imposed in terms of the potential outcomes that are partially identified by data. The inverse probability weighting component incorporates a sensitivity parameter to encode the effect of unmeasured confounding. The instrumental variable and inverse probability weighting methods are unified using the principal stratification. By solving the resulting system of estimating equations, we are able to quantify both the causal treatment effect and the sensitivity parameter (i.e. the degree of the unmeasured confounding). We demonstrate our method by analyzing data from the HIV Epidemiology Research Study.

Correct variable selection addresses the problem of confounding in etiologic research and allows unbiased estimation of probabilities in prognostic studies. The aim of this commentary is to assess how often different variable selection techniques were applied in contemporary epidemiologic analysis. It was of particular interest to see whether modern methods such as shrinkage or penalized regression were used in recent publications. Stepwise selection methods remained the predominant method for variable selection in publications in epidemiological journals in 2008. Shrinkage methods were not used in any of the reviewed articles. Editors, reviewers and authors have insufficiently promoted the new, less controversial approaches of variable selection in the biomedical literature, whereas statisticians may not have adequately addressed the method's feasibility.

Robust Causal Estimation from Observational Studies Using Penalized Spline of Propensity Score for Treatment Comparison	STATS			English	Article						causal inference; double robustness; PENCOMP; variable selection; penalized spline	VARIABLE SELECTION; ADAPTIVE LASSO	Without randomization of treatments, valid inference of treatment effects from observational studies requires controlling for all confounders because the treated subjects generally differ systematically from the control subjects. Confounding control is commonly achieved using the propensity score, defined as the conditional probability of assignment to a treatment given the observed covariates. The propensity score collapses all the observed covariates into a single measure and serves as a balancing score such that the treated and control subjects with similar propensity scores can be directly compared. Common propensity score-based methods include regression adjustment and inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score. We recently proposed a robust multiple imputation-based method, penalized spline of propensity for treatment comparisons (PENCOMP), that includes a penalized spline of the assignment propensity as a predictor. Under the Rubin causal model assumptions that there is no interference across units, that each unit has a non-zero probability of being assigned to either treatment group, and there are no unmeasured confounders, PENCOMP has a double robustness property for estimating treatment effects. In this study, we examine the impact of using variable selection techniques that restrict predictors in the propensity score model to true confounders of the treatment-outcome relationship on PENCOMP. We also propose a variant of PENCOMP and compare alternative approaches to standard error estimation for PENCOMP. Compared to the weighted estimators, PENCOMP is less affected by inclusion of non-confounding variables in the propensity score model. We illustrate the use of PENCOMP and competing methods in estimating the impact of antiretroviral treatments on CD4 counts in HIV+ patients.

The aim of many longitudinal studies is to estimate the causal effect of a time varying exposure on an outcome that requires adjusting for time varying confounding. Time varying confounding affected by previous exposure often occurs in practice, but it is usually adjusted for by using conventional analytical methods such as time dependent Cox regression, random effects models, or generalised estimating equations, which are known to provide biased effect estimates in this setting. This article explains time varying confounding affected by previous exposure and outlines three causal methods proposed to appropriately adjust for this potential bias: inverseprobability-of-treatment weighting, the parametric G formula, and G estimation.

Natural history studies typically follow prospective cohort designs, and enroll large numbers of participants for long-term prospective follow-up (up to several years). Using data from the HIV Epidemiology Research Study (HERS), a six-year natural history study that enrolled 871 HIV-infected women starting in 1993, we investigate the therapeutic effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy regimens (HAART) on CD4 cell count using the marginal structural modeling framework and associated estimation procedures based on inverse-probability weighting (developed by Robins and colleagues). To evaluate treatment effects from a natural history study, specialized methods are needed because treatments are not randomly prescribed and, in particular, the treatment-response relationship can be confounded by variables that are time-varying. Our analysis uses CD4 data on all follow-up visits over a two-year period, and includes sensitivity analyses to investigate potential biases attributable to unmeasured confounding. Strategies for selecting ranges of a sensitivity parameter are given, as are intervals for treatment effect that reflect uncertainty attributable both to sampling and to lack of knowledge about the nature and existence of unmeasured confounding. To our knowledge, this is the first use in "real data" of Robins's sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding (Robins, 1999a, Synthese 121, 151-179). The findings from our analysis are consistent with recent treatment guidelines set by the U.S. Panel of the International AIDS Society (Carpenter et al., 2000, Journal of the American Medical Association 280, 381-391).

Ignoring selection bias can result in unreliable or misleading estimates of the causal effect. Generalized boosted models were used to estimate propensity scores from 42 confounding variables for a sample of 361 neonates. Using emergent neonatal attention and orientation skills as an example developmental outcome, we examined the impact of tobacco exposure with and without accounting for selection bias. Weight at birth, an outcome related to tobacco exposure, also was used to examine the functionality of the propensity score approach. Without inclusion of propensity scores, tobacco-exposed neonates did not differ from their nonexposed peers in attention skills over the first month or in weight at birth. When the propensity score was included as a covariate, exposed infants had marginally lower attention and a slower linear change rate at 4 weeks, with greater quadratic deceleration over the first month. Similarly, exposure-related differences in birth weight emerged when propensity scores were included as a covariate. The propensity score method captured the selection bias intrinsic to this observational study of prenatal tobacco exposure. Selection bias obscured the deleterious impact of tobacco exposure on the development of neonatal attention. The illustrated analytic strategy offers an example to better characterize the impact of prenatal tobacco exposure on important developmental outcomes by directly modeling and statistically accounting for the selection bias from the sampling process.

Examining the Error of Mis-Specifying Nonlinear Confounding Effect With Application on Accelerometer-Measured Physical Activity	RESEARCH QUARTERLY FOR EXERCISE AND SPORT			English	Article						Causality; confounding factors; simulation; statistical models	MODEL FORM; ADJUST; TIME	Purpose: Some confounders are nonlinearly associated with dependent variables, but they are often adjusted using a linear term. The purpose of this study was to examine the error of mis-specifying the nonlinear confounding effect. Methods: We carried out a simulation study to investigate the effect of adjusting for a nonlinear confounder in the estimation of a causal relationship between the exposure and outcome in 3 ways: using a linear term, binning into 5 equal-size categories, or using a restricted cubic spline of the confounder. Continuous, binary, and survival outcomes were simulated. We examined the confounder across varying measurement error. In addition, we performed a real data analysis examining the 3 strategies to handle the nonlinear effects of accelerometer-measured physical activity in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2006 data. Results: The mis-specification of a nonlinear confounder had little impact on causal effect estimation for continuous outcomes. For binary and survival outcomes, this mis-specification introduced bias, which could be eliminated using spline adjustment only when there is small measurement error of the confounder. Real data analysis showed that the associations between high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes and mortality adjusted for physical activity with restricted cubic spline were about 3% to 11% larger than their counterparts adjusted with a linear term. Conclusion: For continuous outcomes, confounders with nonlinear effects can be adjusting with a linear term. Spline adjustment should be used for binary and survival outcomes on confounders with small measurement error.

We present a two-step approach for exposure selection with subsequent confounder adjustment for statistical inference. Methods: We measured cognitive ability in 338 children using the Woodcock-Mun similar to oz General Intellectual Ability (GIA) score, and potential associated features across several environmental domains. Initially, 111 variables theoretically associated with GIA score were introduced into a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) in a 50% feature selection subsample. Effect estimates for selected features were subsequently modeled in linear regressions in a 50% inference (hold out) subsample, first adjusting for sex and age and later for covariates selected via directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). All models were adjusted for clustering by school. Results: Of the 15 LASSO selected variables, eleven were not associated with GIA score following our inference modeling approach. Four variables were associated with GIA scores, including: serum ferritin adjusted for inflammation (inversely), mother's IQ (positively), father's education (positively), and hours per day the child works on homework (positively). Serum ferritin was not in the expected direction. Conclusions: Our two-step approach moves high-dimensional feature selection a step further by incorporating DAG-based confounder adjustment for statistical inference.

Simultaneous SNP selection and adjustment for population structure in high dimensional prediction models	PLOS GENETICS			English	Article							GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; MIXED-MODEL; VARIABLE SELECTION; LASSO; REGULARIZATION; HERITABILITY; RELATEDNESS; DISSECTION; ALGORITHM; STRAINS	Complex traits are known to be influenced by a combination of environmental factors and rare and common genetic variants. However, detection of such multivariate associations can be compromised by low statistical power and confounding by population structure. Linear mixed effects models (LMM) can account for correlations due to relatedness but have not been applicable in high-dimensional (HD) settings where the number of fixed effect predictors greatly exceeds the number of samples. False positives or false negatives can result from two-stage approaches, where the residuals estimated from a null model adjusted for the subjects' relationship structure are subsequently used as the response in a standard penalized regression model. To overcome these challenges, we develop a general penalized LMM with a single random effect called ggmix for simultaneous SNP selection and adjustment for population structure in high dimensional prediction models. We develop a blockwise coordinate descent algorithm with automatic tuning parameter selection which is highly scalable, computationally efficient and has theoretical guarantees of convergence. Through simulations and three real data examples, we show that ggmix leads to more parsimonious models compared to the two-stage approach or principal component adjustment with better prediction accuracy. Our method performs well even in the presence of highly correlated markers, and when the causal SNPs are included in the kinship matrix. ggmix can be used to construct polygenic risk scores and select instrumental variables in Mendelian randomization studies. Our algorithms are available in an R package available on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/package=ggmix). Author summary This work addresses a recurring challenge in the analysis and interpretation of genetic association studies: which genetic variants can best predict and are independently associated with a given phenotype in the presence of population structure? Not controlling confounding due to geographic population structure, family and/or cryptic relatedness can lead to spurious associations. Much of the existing research has therefore focused on modeling the association between a phenotype and a single genetic variant in a linear mixed model with a random effect. However, this univariate approach may miss true associations due to the stringent significance thresholds required to reduce the number of false positives and also ignores the correlations between markers. We propose an alternative method for fitting high-dimensional multivariable models, which selects SNPs that are independently associated with the phenotype while also accounting for population structure. We provide an efficient implementation of our algorithm and show through simulation studies and real data examples that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of prediction accuracy and controlling the false discovery rate.

Synthetic Negative Controls: Using Simulation to Screen Large-scale Propensity Score Analyses	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Causal inference; Confounding; Control studies; Diagnostic; Propensity score	VARIABLE SELECTION; INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES; CONFOUNDING ADJUSTMENT; COVARIATE SELECTION; SUPER LEARNER; BIAS; POSITIVITY; PREDICTION; OUTCOMES; LASSO	The propensity score has become a standard tool to control for large numbers of variables in healthcare database studies. However, little has been written on the challenge of comparing large-scale propensity score analyses that use different methods for confounder selection and adjustment. In these settings, balance diagnostics are useful but do not inform researchers on which variables balance should be assessed or quantify the impact of residual covariate imbalance on bias. Here, we propose a framework to supplement balance diagnostics when comparing large-scale propensity score analyses. Instead of focusing on results from any single analysis, we suggest conducting and reporting results for many analytic choices and using both balance diagnostics and synthetically generated control studies to screen analyses that show signals of bias caused by measured confounding. To generate synthetic datasets, the framework does not require simulating the outcome-generating process. In healthcare database studies, outcome events are often rare, making it difficult to identify and model all predictors of the outcome to simulate a confounding structure closely resembling the given study. Therefore, the framework uses a model for treatment assignment to divide the comparator population into pseudo-treatment groups where covariate differences resemble those in the study cohort. The partially simulated datasets have a confounding structure approximating the study population under the null (synthetic negative control studies). The framework is used to screen analyses that likely violate partial exchangeability due to lack of control for measured confounding. We illustrate the framework using simulations and an empirical example.

J	Schnell, PM; Papadogeorgou, G				Schnell, Patrick M.; Papadogeorgou, Georgia			MITIGATING UNOBSERVED SPATIAL CONFOUNDING WHEN ESTIMATING THE EFFECT OF SUPERMARKET ACCESS ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE DEATHS	ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Causal inference; cardiovascular disease; food access; Markov random field spatial confounding; unmeasured confounding	PROPENSITY SCORE; FOOD STORES; REGRESSION; SELECTION; MODELS; SENSITIVITY; INFERENCE; DESIGN	Confounding by unmeasured spatial variables has received some attention in the spatial statistics and causal inference literatures, but concepts and approaches have remained largely separated. In this paper we aim to bridge these distinct strands of statistics by considering unmeasured spatial confounding within a causal inference framework and estimating effects using outcome regression tools popular within the spatial literature. First, we show how using spatially correlated random effects in the outcome model, an approach common among spatial statisticians, does not necessarily mitigate bias due to spatial confounding, a previously published but not universally known result. Motivated by the bias term of commonly-used estimators, we propose an affine estimator which addresses this deficiency. We discuss how unbiased estimation of causal parameters in the presence of unmeasured spatial confounding can only be achieved under an untestable set of assumptions which will often be application specific. We provide a set of assumptions which describe how the exposure and outcome of interest relate to the unmeasured variables, and we show that this set of assumptions is sufficient for identification of the causal effect based on the observed data when spatial dependencies can be represented by a ring graph. We implement our method using a fully Bayesian approach applicable to any type of outcome variable. This work is motivated by and used to estimate the effect of county-level limited access to supermarkets on the rate of cardiovascular disease deaths in the elderly across the whole continental United States. Even though standard approaches return null or protective effects, our approach uncovers evidence of unobserved spatial confounding and indicates that limited supermarket access has a harmful effect on cardiovascular mortality.

For inference, we develop semiparametric estimators that remain consistent under partial misspecifications of the observed data model.

J	Cefalu, M; Dominici, F; Arvold, N; Parmigiani, G				Cefalu, Matthew; Dominici, Francesca; Arvold, Nils; Parmigiani, Giovanni			Model averaged double robust estimation	BIOMETRICS			English	Article						double robustness; causal inference; variable selection; model averaging; confounding; propensity score	PROPENSITY SCORE; VARIABLE-SELECTION; CONFOUNDER SELECTION; MISSING DATA; ADJUSTMENT; UNCERTAINTY; REGRESSION; EFFICIENCY; CRITERION	Researchers estimating causal effects are increasingly challenged with decisions on how to best control for a potentially high-dimensional set of confounders. Typically, a single propensity score model is chosen and used to adjust for confounding, while the uncertainty surrounding which covariates to include into the propensity score model is often ignored, and failure to include even one important confounder will results in bias. We propose a practical and generalizable approach that overcomes the limitations described above through the use of model averaging. We develop and evaluate this approach in the context of double robust estimation. More specifically, we introduce the model averaged double robust (MA-DR) estimators, which account for model uncertainty in both the propensity score and outcome model through the use of model averaging. The MA-DR estimators are defined as weighted averages of double robust estimators, where each double robust estimator corresponds to a specific choice of the outcome model and the propensity score model. The MA-DR estimators extend the desirable double robustness property by achieving consistency under the much weaker assumption that either the true propensity score model or the true outcome model be within a specified, possibly large, class of models. Using simulation studies, we also assessed small sample properties, and found that MA-DR estimators can reduce mean squared error substantially, particularly when the set of potential confounders is large relative to the sample size. We apply the methodology to estimate the average causal effect of temozolomide plus radiotherapy versus radiotherapy alone on one-year survival in a cohort of 1887 Medicare enrollees who were diagnosed with glioblastoma between June 2005 and December 2009.

For a time-to-event response, marginal structural Cox models are frequently used to deal with such confounding. To avoid some of the problems of fitting marginal structural Cox model, the sequential Cox approach has been suggested as an alternative. Although the estimation mechanisms are different, both approaches claim to estimate the causal effect of treatment by appropriately adjusting for time-dependent confounding. We carry out simulation studies to assess the suitability of the sequential Cox approach for analyzing time-to-event data in the presence of a time-dependent covariate that may or may not be a time-dependent confounder. Results from these simulations revealed that the sequential Cox approach is not as effective as marginal structural Cox model in addressing the time-dependent confounding. The sequential Cox approach was also found to be inadequate in the presence of a time-dependent covariate.

Although the principal estimator of MSM coefficients has been the inverse probability of treatment weight (IPTW) estimator, there are few published examples that illustrate how to apply IPTW or discuss the impact of model selection on effect estimates. The authors applied IPTW estimation of an MSM to observational data from the Fresno Asthmatic Children's Environment Study (2000-2002) to evaluate the effect of asthma rescue medication use on pulmonary function and compared their results with those obtained through traditional regression methods. Akaike's Information Criterion and cross-validation methods were used to fit the MSM. In this paper, the influence of model selection and evaluation of key assumptions such as the experimental treatment assignment assumption are discussed in detail. Traditional analyses suggested that medication use was not associated with an improvement in pulmonary function-a finding that is counterintuitive and probably due to confounding by symptoms and asthma severity. The final MSM estimated that medication use was causally related to a 7% improvement in pulmonary function. The authors present examples that should encourage investigators who use IPTW estimation to undertake and discuss the impact of model-fitting procedures to justify the choice of the final weights.

Nonparametric bounds for the causal effect in a binary instrumental-variable model	STATA JOURNAL			English	Article						st0232; bpbounds; bpboundsi; average causal effect; causal inference; instrumental variables; nonparametric bounds	MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION; IDENTIFICATION; HOMOCYSTEINE; INFERENCE	Instrumental variables can be used to make inferences about causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding. For a model in which the instrument, intermediate/treatment, and outcome variables are all binary, Balke and Pearl (1997, Journal of the American Statistical Association 92: 1172-1.176) derived nonparametric bounds for the intervention probabilities and the average causal effect. We have implemented these bounds in two commands: bpbounds and bpboundsi. We have also implemented several extensions to these bounds. One of these extensions applies when the instrument and outcome are measured in one sample and the instrument and intermediate are measured in another sample. We have also implemented the bounds for an instrument with three categories, as is common in Mendelian randomization analyses in epidemiology and for the case where a monotonic effect of the instrument on the intermediate can be assumed. In each case, we calculate the instrumental-variable inequality constraints as a check for gross violations of the instrumental-variable conditions. The use of the commands is illustrated with a re-creation of the original Balke and Pearl analysis and with a Mendelian randomization analysis. We also give a simulated example to demonstrate that the instrumental-variable inequality constraints can both detect and fail to detect violations of the instrumental-variable conditions.

We consider estimating the effect of a multivariate exposure that includes several continuous agents and their interactionson an outcome, when the true confounding variables are an unknown subset of a potentially large (relative to sample size) set of measured covariates. Our approach is rooted in the ideas of Bayesian model averaging: the exposure effect is estimated as a weighted average of the estimated exposure effects obtained under several linear regression models that include different sets of the potential confounders. We introduce a data-driven prior that assigns to the likely confounders a higher probability of being included into the regression model. We show that our approach can also be formulated as a penalized likelihood formulation with an interpretable tuning parameter. Through a simulation study, we demonstrate that the proposed approach identifies parsimonious models that are fully adjusted for observed confounding and estimates the multivariate exposure effect with smaller mean squared error compared to several alternatives. We apply the method to an Environmental Wide Association Study using National Heath and Nutrition Examination Survey to estimate the effect of mixtures of nutrients and pesticides on lipid levels.

We develop a loss minimization approach for estimating bounds on the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) when unobserved confounders have a bounded effect on the odds ratio of treatment selection. Our approach is scalable and allows flexible use of model classes in estimation, including nonparametric and black-box machine learning methods. Based on these bounds for the CATE, we propose a sensitivity analysis for the average treatment effect (ATE). Our semiparametric estimator extends/bounds the augmented inverse propensity weighted (AIPW) estimator for the ATE under bounded unobserved confounding. By constructing a Neyman orthogonal score, our estimator of the bound for the ATE is a regular root-n estimator so long as the nuisance parameters are estimated at the op(n(-1/4)) rate. We complement our methodology with optimality results showing that our proposed bounds are tight in certain cases. We demonstrate our method on simulated and real data examples, and show accurate coverage of our confidence intervals in practical finite sample regimes with rich covariate information.

J	Genbäck, M; de Luna, X				Genback, Minna; de Luna, Xavier			Causal inference accounting for unobserved confounding after outcome regression and doubly robust estimation	BIOMETRICS			English	Article						average causal effects; double robust; ignorability assumption; regular food intake; sensitivity analysis; uncertainty intervals	SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; SAMPLE SELECTION; GRIP STRENGTH; UNCERTAINTY; MODELS; HEALTH; BIAS	Causal inference with observational data can be performed under an assumption of no unobserved confounders (unconfoundedness assumption). There is, however, seldom clear subject-matter or empirical evidence for such an assumption. We therefore develop uncertainty intervals for average causal effects based on outcome regression estimators and doubly robust estimators, which provide inference taking into account both sampling variability and uncertainty due to unobserved confounders. In contrast with sampling variation, uncertainty due to unobserved confounding does not decrease with increasing sample size. The intervals introduced are obtained by modeling the treatment assignment mechanism and its correlation with the outcome given the observed confounders, allowing us to derive the bias of the estimators due to unobserved confounders. We are thus also able to contrast the size of the bias due to violation of the unconfoundedness assumption, with bias due to misspecification of the models used to explain potential outcomes. This is illustrated through numerical experiments where bias due to moderate unobserved confounding dominates misspecification bias for typical situations in terms of sample size and modeling assumptions. We also study the empirical coverage of the uncertainty intervals introduced and apply the results to a study of the effect of regular food intake on health. An R-package implementing the inference proposed is available.

Collaborative-controlled LASSO for constructing propensity score-based estimators in high-dimensional data	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Propensity score; average treatment effect; LASSO; model selection; electronic healthcare database; collaborative targeted minimum loss-based estimation	CONFOUNDING ADJUSTMENT; REGRESSION; PERFORMANCE; ROBUSTNESS; ALGORITHM; INFERENCE; SELECTION; MODELS; SAFETY; DRUG	Propensity score-based estimators are increasingly used for causal inference in observational studies. However, model selection for propensity score estimation in high-dimensional data has received little attention. In these settings, propensity score models have traditionally been selected based on the goodness-of-fit for the treatment mechanism itself, without consideration of the causal parameter of interest. Collaborative minimum loss-based estimation is a novel methodology for causal inference that takes into account information on the causal parameter of interest when selecting a propensity score model. This "collaborative learning" considers variable associations with both treatment and outcome when selecting a propensity score model in order to minimize a bias-variance tradeoff in the estimated treatment effect. In this study, we introduce a novel approach for collaborative model selection when using the LASSO estimator for propensity score estimation in high-dimensional covariate settings. To demonstrate the importance of selecting the propensity score model collaboratively, we designed quasi-experiments based on a real electronic healthcare database, where only the potential outcomes were manually generated, and the treatment and baseline covariates remained unchanged. Results showed that the collaborative minimum loss-based estimation algorithm outperformed other competing estimators for both point estimation and confidence interval coverage. In addition, the propensity score model selected by collaborative minimum loss-based estimation could be applied to other propensity score-based estimators, which also resulted in substantive improvement for both point estimation and confidence interval coverage. We illustrate the discussed concepts through an empirical example comparing the effects of non-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with selective COX-2 inhibitors on gastrointestinal complications in a population of Medicare beneficiaries.

However, in the literature, the term confounding by indication is not always used consistently. The authors found three different situations in which the term has been applied or might have been used but was not: confounding by indication as protopathic bias, as confounding by severity, or as a form of selection bias. It might be helpful to limit use of the term confounding by indication to the situation in which the disease that forms the indication acts as a confounder irrespective of its severity and to apply the term confounding by severity ii the severity of this disease acts as a confounder. Protopathic bias and selection bias should not be confused with these terms. The use of appropriate terms ultimately will improve communication among researchers and contribute to the clarity of their papers.

However, causal thinking has since developed, with three of the most prominent approaches implicitly or explicitly building on the potential outcomes framework: directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), sufficient-component cause models (SCC models, also referred to as 'causal pies') and the grading of recommendations, assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) methodology. This paper explores how these approaches relate to BH's viewpoints and considers implications for improving causal assessment. We mapped the three approaches above against each BH viewpoint. We found overlap across the approaches and BH viewpoints, underscoring BH viewpoints' enduring importance. Mapping the approaches helped elucidate the theoretical underpinning of each viewpoint and articulate the conditions when the viewpoint would be relevant. Our comparisons identified commonality on four viewpoints: strength of association (including analysis of plausible confounding); temporality; plausibility (encoded by DAGs or SCC models to articulate mediation and interaction, respectively); and experiments (including implications of study design on exchangeability). Consistency may be more usefully operationalised by considering an effect size's transportability to a different population or unexplained inconsistency in effect sizes (statistical heterogeneity). Because specificity rarely occurs, falsification exposures or outcomes (i.e., negative controls) may be more useful. The presence of a dose-response relationship may be less than widely perceived as it can easily arise from confounding. We found limited utility for coherence and analogy. This study highlights a need for greater clarity on BH viewpoints to improve causal assessment.

A Proxy Variable View of Shared Confounding	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING, VOL 139	Proceedings of Machine Learning Research		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)	JUL 18-24, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK				BLESSINGS; IDENTIFICATION	Causal inference from observational data can be biased by unobserved confounders. Confounders-the variables that affect both the treatments and the outcome-induce spurious non-causal correlations between the two. Without additional conditions, unobserved confounders generally make causal quantities hard to identify. In this paper, we focus on the setting where there are many treatments with shared confounding, and we study under what conditions is causal identification possible. The key observation is that we can view subsets of treatments as proxies of the unobserved confounder and identify the intervention distributions of the rest. Moreover, while existing identification formulas for proxy variables involve solving integral equations, we show that one can circumvent the need for such solutions by directly modeling the data. Finally, we extend these results to an expanded class of causal graphs, those with other confounders and selection variables.

These range from ultrasensitive molecular switches in signaling pathways, to assembly and activation of inflammasomes, to rupture of lysosomes and pyroptosis of cells. Realistic dose-response modeling and risk analysis must confront the reality of nonlinear C-R functions. This paper reviews several challenges for traditional statistical regression modeling of C-R functions with thresholds and nonlinearities, together with methods for overcoming them. Statistically significantly positive exposure-response regression coefficients can arise from many non-causal sources such as model specification errors, incompletely controlled confounding, exposure estimation errors, attribution of interactions to factors, associations among explanatory variables, or coincident historical trends. If so, the unadjusted regression coefficients do not necessarily predict how or whether reducing exposure would reduce risk. We discuss statistical options for controlling for such threats, and advocate causal Bayesian networks and dynamic simulation models as potentially valuable complements to nonparametric regression modeling for assessing causally interpretable nonlinear C-R functions and understanding how time patterns of exposures affect risk. We conclude that these approaches are promising for extending the great advances made in statistical C-R modeling methods in recent decades to clarify how to design regulations that are more causally effective in protecting human health.

Consequently, there has been a recent focus on the development of data-driven methods for high-dimensional proxy confounder adjustment in pharmacoepidemiologic research. In this paper, we survey current approaches and recent advancements for high-dimensional proxy confounder adjustment in healthcare database studies. Methods We discuss considerations underpinning three areas for high-dimensional proxy confounder adjustment: (1) feature generation-transforming raw data into covariates (or features) to be used for proxy adjustment; (2) covariate prioritization, selection, and adjustment; and (3) diagnostic assessment. We discuss challenges and avenues of future development within each area. Results There is a large literature on methods for high-dimensional confounder prioritization/selection, but relatively little has been written on best practices for feature generation and diagnostic assessment. Consequently, these areas have particular limitations and challenges. Conclusions There is a growing body of evidence showing that machine-learning algorithms for high-dimensional proxy-confounder adjustment can supplement investigator-specified variables to improve confounding control compared to adjustment based on investigator-specified variables alone. However, more research is needed on best practices for feature generation and diagnostic assessment when applying methods for high-dimensional proxy confounder adjustment in pharmacoepidemiologic studies.

This study aimed to explain (dis)advantages of these techniques in estimating the effect of breast-conserving therapy (BCT) and mastectomy on 10-year distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS).MethodsAll women diagnosed in 2005 with primary T1-2N0-1 breast cancer treated with BCT or mastectomy were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. We used multivariable Cox regression to correct for confounding. Propensity trimming was used to create a more homogeneous population for which the treatment choice was not self-evident. Hospital of surgery was used as hierarchical level to handle hospital-related variation, and as IV to deal with unmeasured confounding.ResultsMultivariable Cox regression showed higher 10-year DMFS for BCT than mastectomy [HR 0.70 (95% CI 0.60-82)]. Propensity trimming on the 10-90th and the 20-80th percentile of the propensity score distribution and hierarchical modelling showed similar HRs. IV analysis showed no significant difference between BCT and mastectomy.ConclusionUnmeasured confounding is very difficult to eliminate in observational research. We cannot conclude that BCT or mastectomy has a causal relationship with 10-year DMFS. It is crucial to critically evaluate all model's assumptions, and to be careful in drawing firm conclusions.

Diagnosing Covariate Balance Across Levels of Right-Censoring Before and After Application of Inverse-Probability-of-Censoring Weights	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						attrition; covariate balance; dependent censoring; informative censoring; inverse-probability-of-censoring weights; IPCW; per-protocol effect; selection bias	CLINICAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC TRIALS; PROPENSITY SCORE; DROPOUT RATES; CAUSAL; INTERVENTION; INFERENCE; MODELS; BIAS	Covariate balance is a central concept in the potential outcomes literature. With selected populations or missing data, balance across treatment groups can be insufficient for estimating marginal treatment effects. Recently, a framework for using covariate balance to describe measured confounding and selection bias for time-varying and other multivariate exposures in the presence of right-censoring has been proposed. Here, we revisit this framework to consider balance across levels of right-censoring over time in more depth. Specifically, we develop measures of covariate balance that can describe what is known as "dependent censoring" in the literature, along with its associated selection bias, under multiple mechanisms for right censoring. Such measures are interesting because they substantively describe the evolution of dependent censoring mechanisms. Furthermore, we provide weighted versions that can depict how well such dependent censoring has been eliminated when inverse-probability-of-censoring weights are applied. These results provide a conceptually grounded way to inspect covariate balance across levels of right-censoring as a validity check. As a motivating example, we applied these measures to a study of hypothetical "static" and "dynamic" treatment protocols in a sequential multiple-assignment randomized trial of antipsychotics with high dropout rates.

Trends in the individual-level and ecological models were in opposite directions. suggesting confounding by indication in the individual-level analysis. The two-level analysis revealed a strong association between institutional utilization of endovascular therapy and reduced individual risk of in-hospital death. Using an ecological treatment variable in an individual analysis may combine reduced confounding by indication in ecological analyses with increased power and more precise specification of outcomes and covariates in individual-level analyses.

To improve efficiency, multiple instruments are routinely used, raising concerns about bias due to possible violation of the instrumental variable assumptions. To address such concerns, we introduce a new class of G-estimators that are guaranteed to remain consistent and asymptotically normal for the causal effect of interest provided that a set of at least ? out of K candidate instruments are valid, for ? = K set by the analyst ex ante without necessarily knowing the identities of the valid and invalid instruments. We provide formal semiparametric efficiency theory supporting our results. Simulation studies and applications to UK Biobank data demonstrate the superior empirical performance of the proposed estimators compared with competing methods.

This poses a challenge to detecting associations of interest and is known to induce spurious associations when left unaccounted for. Penalized linear mixed models (LMMs) are an attractive method to correct for unobserved confounding. These methods correct for varying levels of relatedness and population structure by modeling it as a random effect with a covariance structure estimated from observed genetic data. Despite an extensive literature on penalized regression and LMMs separately, the two are rarely discussed together. The aim of this review is to do so while examining the statistical properties of penalized LMMs in the genetic association setting. Specifically, the ability of penalized LMMs to accurately estimate genetic effects in the presence of environmental confounding has not been well studied. To clarify the important yet subtle distinction between population structure and environmental heterogeneity, we present a detailed review of relevant concepts and methods. In addition, we evaluate the performance of penalized LMMs and competing methods in terms of estimation and selection accuracy in the presence of a number of confounding structures.

However, with few exposed outcomes to inform covariate selection and many candidate confounders, optimal approaches to construct and implement propensity-score-based confounding adjustment remain unclear. Methods: In a cohort study on the effect of anticonvulsant drugs on cardiovascular risk among adult patients from the HealthCore Integrated Research Database, we compared the performance for confounding control of various covariate-selection strategies for propensity-score estimation (expert knowledge only, expert knowledge informed by empirical covariate selection via high-dimensional propensity-score, and high-dimensional propensity-score empirical specification only) and propensity-score-based adjustment methods (propensity-score-matching and propensity-score-decile stratification). This article focuses on the first 90 days of follow-up because any treatment effect identified in this temporal window almost certainty originates from residual confounding rather than pharmacologic action. Results: We identified 166,031 new users and 564 ischemic cardiovascular events. Among those, 12,580 patients initiated anticonvulsants that strongly induce cytochrome P450 enzymes and experienced 68 events. The unadjusted hazard ratio was 1.72 (95% confidence interval = 1.34-2.22). Adjustment for investigator-identified covariates led to 41% to 59% reductions in the hazard ratio; adjustment for both investigator-identified and high-dimensional propensity-score empirically identified covariates led to larger reductions (54% to 72%). A selection strategy based on high-dimensional propensity-score empirical specification alone produced less-attenuated and more-volatile hazard ratio estimates. This volatility seemed to be slightly attenuated in a trimmed propensity-score-stratified analysis. Conclusions: The high-dimensional propensity-score algorithm complements expert knowledge for confounding adjustment, but in settings with few exposed outcomes, its performance without investigator-specified covariates is less clear and may be associated with an increased likelihood of bias. In our example, investigator specification of variables combined with high-dimensional propensity-score empirical selection and the use of trimmed propensity-score-stratified analysis seem to improve effect estimation. Plotting the relation of effect estimates to the increasing number of empirical covariates is a useful diagnostic.

Although this approach controls for time-invariant confounders by design, it may allow for selection bias and confounding by time-varying factors. We conducted a simulation study of the sensitivity of the symmetric bidirectional case-crossover design to time-varying patterns in exposure and outcome. We identified the effects of selection bias and confounding on symmetric bidirectional case-cross, over results and offer strategies to eliminate or reduce these biases. Selection bias results when exposure in the reference periods is not identically representative of exposure in the hazard periods, even when the distribution of exposure is stationary. This bias can be estimated and removed. Selection bias also occurs when the distribution of exposure is nonstationary, but the adjusted symmetric bidirectional case-crossover methodology substantially controls for this. Confounding results from a common temporal pattern in the exposure and the outcome time series, but can also be the result of patterns in exposure and outcome that, although asymptotically uncorrelated, are correlated at finite series lengths. All three biases are reduced by choosing shorter referent-spacing lengths. This effect is illustrated using data on air pollution and daily deaths in Chicago.

We adopt a unified causal framework, predicated on domain knowledge, theory-justified constraints anda data-driven causal structure discovery using causal graphs. We answer our causal query by employing machine learning prediction algorithms; instrumental variables in the presence of latent confounding and Heckman's model in the presence of selection bias. Results show that educated regions are able to distance-work and educational human capital is a key factor in reducing workplace mobility, possibly through its impact on employment. This pattern leads to higher workplace mobility for less educated regions and translates into higher Covid-19 infection rates. The future of the pandemic lies in less educated segments of developing countries and calls for public health action to decrease its unequal and pervasive impact.

Alzheimer's Dis Neuroimaging	Frameworks for estimating causal effects in observational settings: comparing confounder adjustment and instrumental variables	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Review						Causal inference; Observational studies; Instrumental variables; Adjustment; Propensity scores	PROPENSITY SCORE; BIAS; INFERENCE; MODELS; REGRESSION; DONEPEZIL; POSITIVITY; SELECTION; TESTS	To estimate causal effects, analysts performing observational studies in health settings utilize several strategies to mitigate bias due to confounding by indication. There are two broad classes of approaches for these purposes: use of confounders and instrumental variables (IVs). Because such approaches are largely characterized by untestable assumptions, analysts must operate under an indefinite paradigm that these methods will work imperfectly. In this tutorial, we formalize a set of general principles and heuristics for estimating causal effects in the two approaches when the assumptions are potentially violated. This crucially requires reframing the process of observational studies as hypothesizing potential scenarios where the estimates from one approach are less inconsistent than the other. While most of our discussion of methodology centers around the linear setting, we touch upon complexities in non-linear settings and flexible procedures such as target minimum loss-based estimation and double machine learning. To demonstrate the application of our principles, we investigate the use of donepezil off-label for mild cognitive impairment. We compare and contrast results from confounder and IV methods, traditional and flexible, within our analysis and to a similar observational study and clinical trial.	[Zawadzki, Roy S.

Meaningful Causal Decompositions in Health Equity Research Definition, Identification, and Estimation Through a Weighting Framework	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Allowability; Causal inference; Disparity; Equity; Ethics; Interventional effects; Mediation analysis; Oaxaca&#8211; Blinder decomposition	MEDIATION ANALYSIS; DISPARITIES	Causal decomposition analyses can help build the evidence base for interventions that address health disparities (inequities). They ask how disparities in outcomes may change under hypothetical intervention. Through study design and assumptions, they can rule out alternate explanations such as confounding, selection bias, and measurement error, thereby identifying potential targets for intervention. Unfortunately, the literature on causal decomposition analysis and related methods have largely ignored equity concerns that actual interventionists would respect, limiting their relevance and practical value. This article addresses these concerns by explicitly considering what covariates the outcome disparity and hypothetical intervention adjust for (so-called allowable covariates) and the equity value judgments these choices convey, drawing from the bioethics, biostatistics, epidemiology, and health services research literatures. From this discussion, we generalize decomposition estimands and formulae to incorporate allowable covariate sets (and thereby reflect equity choices) while still allowing for adjustment of non-allowable covariates needed to satisfy causal assumptions. For these general formulae, we provide weighting-based estimators based on adaptations of ratio-of-mediator-probability and inverse-odds-ratio weighting. We discuss when these estimators reduce to already used estimators under certain equity value judgments, and a novel adaptation under other judgments.

It is recommended in epidemiologic textbooks and articles over significance test of coefficients, but concerns have been raised concerning its validity. Few simulation studies have been conducted to investigate its performance. Methods An extensive simulation study was realized to compare different implementations of the change in estimate method. The implementations were also compared when estimating the association of body mass index with diastolic blood pressure in the PROspective Quebec Study on Work and Health. Results All methods were susceptible to introduce important bias and to produce confidence intervals that included the true effect much less often than expected in at least some scenarios. Overall mixed results were obtained regarding the accuracy of estimators, as measured by the mean squared error. No implementation adequately differentiated confounders from non-confounders. In the real data analysis, none of the implementation decreased the estimated standard error. Conclusion Based on these results, it is questionable whether change in estimate methods are beneficial in general, considering their low ability to improve the precision of estimates without introducing bias and inability to yield valid confidence intervals or to identify true confounders.

However, most estimation methods rely on the strong assumption that all confounders are observed, which is impractical and untestable in the real world. We develop a mediation analysis framework inferring the latent confounder for debiasing both direct and indirect causal effects. Specifically, we introduce generalized structural equation modeling that incorporates structured latent factors to improve the goodness-of-fit of the model to observed data, and deconfound the mediators and outcome simultaneously. One major advantage of the proposed framework is that it uses the causal pathway structure from cause to outcome via multiple mediators to debias the causal effect without requiring external information on latent confounders. In addition, the proposed framework is flexible in terms of integrating powerful nonparametric prediction algorithms while retaining interpretable mediation effects. In theory, we establish the identification of both causal and mediation effects based on the proposed deconfounding method. Numerical experiments on both simulation settings and a normative aging study indicate that the proposed approach reduces the estimation bias of both causal and mediation effects.

Marginal Structural Models for Life-Course Theories and Social Epidemiology: Definitions, Sources of Bias, and Simulated Illustrations	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						bias; confounding; inverse probability weighting; life course; marginal structural models; simulation; social epidemiology	CAUSAL INFERENCE; INCIDENT STROKE; RISK; METAANALYSIS; DEPRESSION; ZIDOVUDINE; MORTALITY; ALCOHOL; DISEASE; ONSET	Social epidemiology aims to identify social structural risk factors, thus informing targets and timing of interventions. Ascertaining which interventions will be most effective and when they should be implemented is challenging because social conditions vary across the life course and are subject to time-varying confounding. Marginal structural models (MSMs) may be useful but can present unique challenges when studying social epidemiologic exposures over the life course. We describe selected MSMs corresponding to common theoretical life-course models and identify key issues for consideration related to time-varying confounding and late study enrollment. Using simulated data mimicking a cohort study evaluating the effects of depression in early, mid-, and late life on late-life stroke risk, we examined whether and when specific study characteristics and analytical strategies may induce bias. In the context of time-varying confounding, inverse-probability-weighted estimation of correctly specified MSMs accurately estimated the target causal effects, while conventional regression models showed significant bias. When no measure of early-life depression was available, neither MSMs nor conventional models were unbiased, due to confounding by early-life depression. To inform interventions, researchers need to identify timing of effects and consider whether missing data regarding exposures earlier in life may lead to biased estimates.

A general instrumental variable framework for regression analysis with outcome missing not at random	BIOMETRICS			English	Article						Complete-case analysis; Instrumental variable; Nonignorable missing data; Selection bias	SAMPLE SELECTION; LONGITUDINAL DATA; MODELS; BIAS	The instrumental variable (IV) design is a well-known approach for unbiased evaluation of causal effects in the presence of unobserved confounding. In this article, we study the IV approach to account for selection bias in regression analysis with outcome missing not at random. In such a setting, a valid IV is a variable which (i) predicts the nonresponse process, and (ii) is independent of the outcome in the underlying population. We show that under the additional assumption (iii) that the IV is independent of the magnitude of selection bias due to nonresponse, the population regression in view is nonparametrically identified. For point estimation under (i)-(iii), we propose a simple complete-case analysis which modifies the regression of primary interest by carefully incorporating the IV to account for selection bias. The approach is developed for the identity, log and logit link functions. For inferences about the marginal mean of a binary outcome assuming (i) and (ii) only, we describe novel and approximately sharp bounds which unlike Robins-Manski bounds, are smooth in model parameters, therefore allowing for a straightforward approach to account for uncertainty due to sampling variability. These bounds provide a more honest account of uncertainty and allows one to assess the extent to which a violation of the key identifying condition (iii) might affect inferences. For illustration, the methods are used to account for selection bias induced by HIV testing nonparticipation in the evaluation of HIV prevalence in the Zambian Demographic and Health Surveys.

Bias is evident when estimating influenza vaccine effectiveness, even after adjustment for claims-based indicators of illness. We explored bias reduction methods while estimating vaccine effectiveness in a cohort of adult hemodialysis patients. Using the United States Renal Data System and linked data from a commercial dialysis provider, we estimated vaccine effectiveness using a Cox proportional hazards marginal structural model of all-cause mortality before and during 3 influenza seasons in 2005/2006 through 2007/2008. To improve confounding control, we added frailty indicators to the model, measured time-varying confounders at different time intervals, and restricted the sample in multiple ways. Crude and baseline-adjusted marginal structural models remained strongly biased. Restricting to a healthier population removed some unmeasured confounding; however, this reduced the sample size, resulting in wide confidence intervals. We estimated an influenza vaccine effectiveness of 9% (hazard ratio = 0.91, 95% confidence interval: 0.72, 1.15) when bias was minimized through cohort restriction. In this study, the healthy-user bias could not be controlled through statistical adjustment; however, sample restriction reduced much of the bias.	[McGrath, Leah J.; Brookhart, M.

The paper focuses on the logical connections among the different types of models and on the different strengths of each approach. Graphical models can illustrate qualitative population assumptions and sources of bias not easily seen with other approaches; sufficient-component cause models can illustrate specific hypotheses about mechanisms of action; and potential-outcome and structural-equations models provide a basis for quantitative analysis of effects. The different approaches provide complementary perspectives, and can be employed together to improve causal interpretations of conventional statistical results.

Invited Commentary: Causal Diagrams and Measurement Bias	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Editorial Material						bias (epidemiology); body mass index; causality; confounding factors (epidemiology)	BODY-MASS INDEX; NONDIFFERENTIAL MISCLASSIFICATION; STRUCTURAL APPROACH; KNOWLEDGE	Causal inferences about the effect of an exposure on an outcome may be biased by errors in the measurement of either the exposure or the outcome. Measurement errors of exposure and outcome can be classified into 4 types: independent nondifferential, dependent nondifferential, independent differential, and dependent differential. Here the authors describe how causal diagrams can be used to represent these 4 types of measurement bias and discuss some problems that arise when using measured exposure variables (e.g., body mass index) to make inferences about the causal effects of unmeasured constructs (e.g., "adiposity"). The authors conclude that causal diagrams need to be used to represent biases arising not only from confounding and selection but also from measurement.

The goal of this article is to provide a non-technical, practical introduction to IV methods for comparative safety and effectiveness research. We outline the principles and basic assumptions necessary for valid IV estimation, discuss how to interpret the results of an IV study, provide a review of instruments that have been used in comparative effectiveness research, and suggest some minimal reporting standards for an IV analysis. Finally, we offer our perspective of the role of IV estimation vis-a-vis more traditional approaches based on statistical modeling of the exposure or outcome. We anticipate that IV methods will be often underpowered for drug safety studies of very rare outcomes, but may be potentially useful in studies of intended effects where uncontrolled confounding may be substantial.

J	Greenland, S; Morgenstern, H				Greenland, S; Morgenstern, H			Confounding in health research	ANNUAL REVIEW OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Review						bias; causation; collapsibility; confounder; epidemiologic methods	CAUSAL INFERENCE; COLLAPSIBILITY; DIAGRAMS; EXCHANGEABILITY; IDENTIFIABILITY; IDENTIFICATION; NONCOMPLIANCE; REGRESSIONS; COMPONENTS; MORTALITY	Consideration of confounding is fundamental to the design, analysis, and interpretation of studies intended to estimate causal effects. Unfortunately, the word confounding has been used synonymously with several other terms, and it has been used to refer to at least four distinct concepts. This paper provides an overview of confounding and related concepts based on a counterfactual model of causation. In this context, which predominates in nonexperimental research, confounding is a source of bias in the estimation of causal effects. Special attention is given to the history of definitions of confounding, the distinction between confounding and confounders, problems in the control of confounding, the relations of confounding to exchangeability and collapsibility, and confounding in randomized trials.

Improving Observational Study Estimates of Treatment Effects Using Joint Modeling of Selection Effects and Outcomes <i>The Case of AAA Repair</i>	MEDICAL CARE			English	Article						abdominal aortic aneurysm; bivariate probit; endovascular and open surgery; selection; volume-outcome relationship	ABDOMINAL AORTIC-ANEURYSM; VOLUME; MORTALITY; CARE	Background: When 2 treatment approaches are available, there are likely to be unmeasured confounders that influence choice of procedure, which complicates estimation of the causal effect of treatment on outcomes using observational data. Objective: To estimate the effect of endovascular (endo) versus open surgical (open) repair, including possible modification by institutional volume, on survival after treatment for abdominal aortic aneurysm, accounting for observed and unobserved confounding variables. Research Design: Observational study of data from the Medicare program using a joint model of treatment selection and survival given treatment to estimate the effects of type of surgery and institutional volume on survival. Patients: We studied 61,414 eligible repairs of intact abdominal aortic aneurysms during 2001 to 2004. Measures: The outcome, perioperative death, is defined as in-hospital death or death within 30 days of operation. The key predictors are use of endo, transformed endo and open volume, and endo-volume interactions. Results: There is strong evidence of nonrandom selection of treatment with potential confounding variables including institutional volume and procedure date, variables not typically adjusted for in clinical trials. The best fitting model included heterogeneous transformations of endo volume for endo cases and open volume for open cases as predictors. Consistent with our hypothesis, accounting for unmeasured selection reduced the mortality benefit of endo. Conclusions: The effect of endo versus open surgery varies nonlinearly with endo and open volume. Accounting for institutional experience and unmeasured selection enables better decision-making by physicians making treatment referrals, investigators evaluating treatments, and policy makers.

A ROBUST AND EFFICIENT APPROACH TO CAUSAL INFERENCE BASED ON SPARSE SUFFICIENT DIMENSION REDUCTION	ANNALS OF STATISTICS			English	Article						Average treatment effect; dimension reduction; high-dimensional data; multiple-index model; outcome regression; semiparametric efficiency	SLICED INVERSE REGRESSION; PROPENSITY SCORE; VEGETABLE INTAKE; MISSING DATA; LARGE-SAMPLE; BODY-MASS; SELECTION; INDEX; ASSOCIATION; MODEL	A fundamental assumption used in causal inference with observational data is that treatment assignment is ignorable given measured confounding variables. This assumption of no missing confounders is plausible if a large number of baseline covariates are included in the analysis, as we often have no prior knowledge of which variables can be important confounders. Thus, estimation of treatment effects with a large number of covariates has received considerable attention in recent years. Most existing methods require specifying certain parametric models involving the outcome, treatment and confounding variables, and employ a variable selection procedure to identify confounders. However, selection of a proper set of confounders depends on correct specification of the working models. The bias due to model mis-specification and incorrect selection of confounding variables can yield misleading results. We propose a robust and efficient approach for inference about the average treatment effect via a flexible modeling strategy incorporating penalized variable selection. Specifically, we consider an estimator constructed based on an efficient influence function that involves a propensity score and an outcome regression. We then propose a new sparse sufficient dimension reduction method to estimate these two functions without making restrictive parametric modeling assumptions. The proposed estimator of the average treatment effect is asymptotically normal and semiparametrically efficient without the need for variable selection consistency. The proposed methods are illustrated via simulation studies and a biomedical application.

Directed Acyclic Graphs for Oral Disease Research	JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH			English	Review						observational study design; epidemiologic methods; confounders; bias; mediators; causation	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; 5 SYSTEMIC CONDITIONS; CAUSAL-DIAGRAMS; GENERALIZED HYPERVIGILANCE; SELECTION BIAS; MISSING DATA; EPIDEMIOLOGY; KNOWLEDGE; INFERENCE; COLLIDER	Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are nonparametric graphical tools used to depict causal relations in the epidemiologic assessment of exposure-outcome associations. Although their use in dental research was first advocated in 2002, DAGs have yet to be widely adopted in this field. DAGs help identify threats to causal inference such as confounders, bias due to subject selection, and inappropriate handling of missing data. DAGs can also inform the data analysis strategy based on relations among variables depicted on it. This article uses the example of a study of temporomandibular disorders (TMDs), investigating causal effects of facial injury on subsequent risk of TMD. We illustrate how DAGs can be used to identify 1) potential confounders, 2) mediators and the consequences of attempt to estimate direct causal effects, 3) colliders and the consequences of conditioning on colliders, and 4) variables that are simultaneously mediators and confounders and the consequences of adjustment for such variables. For example, one DAG shows that statistical adjustment for the pressure pain threshold would necessarily bias the causal relation between facial injury and TMD. Finally, we discuss the usefulness of DAGs during study design, subject selection, and choosing variables to be measured in a study.	[Akinkugbe, A.

J	Sun, GW; Shook, TL; Kay, GL				Sun, GW; Shook, TL; Kay, GL			Inappropriate use of bivariable analysis to screen risk factors for use in multivariable analysis	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						risk factors; bivariable analysis; confounding; variable selection; bias; multivariable analysis	CORONARY-ARTERY DISEASE; BYPASS GRAFT-SURGERY; AORTIC-VALVE REPLACEMENT; TERM FOLLOW-UP; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; OPERATIVE MORTALITY; COLORECTAL-CANCER; EJECTION FRACTION; NOISE VARIABLES; STOPPING RULES	The use of bivariable selection (BVS) for selecting variables to be used in multivariable analysis is inappropriate despite its common usage in medical sciences. In BVS, if the statistical p value of a risk factor in bivariable analysis is greater than an arbitrary value (often p = 0.05), then this factor will not be allowed to compete for inclusion in multivariable analysis. This type of variable selection is inappropriate because the BVS method wrongly rejects potentially important variables when the relationship between an outcome and a risk factor is confounded by any confounder and when this confounder is not properly controlled. This article uses both hypothetical and actual data to show how a nonsignificant risk factor in bivariable analysis may actually be a significant risk factor in multivariable analysis if confounding is properly controlled. Furthermore, problems resulting from the automated forward and stepwise modeling with or without the presence of confounding are also addressed, To avoid these improper procedures and deficiencies, alternatives in performing multivariable analysis, including advantages and disadvantages of the BVS method and automated stepwise modeling, are reviewed and discussed.

In contrast, methods based on marginal structural models (MSMs) can provide consistent estimates of causal effects when unmeasured confounding and model misspecification are absent. MSMs are a new class of causal models whose parameters are estimated using a new class of estimators-inverse-probability-of-treatment weighted estimators. We use a marginal structural Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the joint effect of zidovudine (AZT) and prophylaxis therapy for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia on the survival of HIV-positive men in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, an observational study of homosexual men. We obtained an estimated causal mortality rate (hazard) ratio of .67 (conservative 95% confidence interval .46-.98) for AZT and of 1.14 (.79, 1.64) for prophylaxis therapy. These estimates will be consistent for the true causal rate ratios when the functional forms chosen for our models are correct and data have been obtained on all time-independent and time-dependent covariates that predict both subsequent treatment and mortality.

However, due to lack of enough covariates in most environmental data sets, current methods without enough adjustments for confounders inevitably lead to residual confounding. We propose a negative-control exposure based on a time-series studies (NCE-TS) model to effectively eliminate unobserved confounders using an after-outcome exposure as a negative-control exposure. We show that the causal effect is identifiable and can be estimated by the NCE-TS for continuous and categorical outcomes. Simulation studies indicate unbiased estimation by the NCE-TS model. The potential of NCE-TS is illustrated by 2 challenging applications: We found that living in areas with higher levels of surrounding greenness over 6 months was associated with less risk of stroke-specific mortality, based on the Shandong Ecological Health Cohort during January 1,2010, to December 31,2018. In addition, we found that the widely established negative association between temperature and cancer risks was actually caused by numbers of unobserved confounders, according to the Global Open Database from 2003-2012. The proposed NCE-TS model is implemented in an R package (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) called NCETS, freely available on GitHub.

We propose a method to simultaneously address both issues in the form of a semi-parametric sensitivity analysis. In particular, our approach incorporates Bayesian Additive Regression Trees into a two-parameter sensitivity analysis strategy that assesses sensitivity of posterior distributions of treatment effects to choices of sensitivity parameters. This results in an easily interpretable framework for testing for the impact of an unmeasured confounder that also limits the number of modeling assumptions. We evaluate our approach in a large-scale simulation setting and with high blood pressure data taken from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

Causal inference with observational data: the need for triangulation of evidence	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Review						causal inference; epidemiology; mental health; observational data; triangulation	ALCOHOL-CONSUMPTION; MEASUREMENT ERROR; MEDIATION ANALYSIS; MATERNAL SMOKING; SUBSTANCE USE; MISSING DATA; SIMULATION-EXTRAPOLATION; DRUG-USE; BIAS; MODELS	The goal of much observational research is to identify risk factors that have a causal effect on health and social outcomes. However, observational data are subject to biases from confounding, selection and measurement, which can result in an underestimate or overestimate of the effect of interest. Various advanced statistical approaches exist that offer certain advantages in terms of addressing these potential biases. However, although these statistical approaches have different underlying statistical assumptions, in practice they cannot always completely remove key sources of bias; therefore, using design-based approaches to improve causal inference is also important. Here it is the design of the study that addresses the problem of potential bias - either by ensuring it is not present (under certain assumptions) or by comparing results across methods with different sources and direction of potential bias. The distinction between statistical and design-based approaches is not an absolute one, but it provides a framework for triangulation - the thoughtful application of multiple approaches (e.g. statistical and design based), each with their own strengths and weaknesses, and in particular sources and directions of bias. It is unlikely that any single method can provide a definite answer to a causal question, but the triangulation of evidence provided by different approaches can provide a stronger basis for causal inference. Triangulation can be considered part of wider efforts to improve the transparency and robustness of scientific research, and the wider scientific infrastructure and system of incentives.

Our aim is to formulate a marginal structural model for estimating diabetes care provisions in which we envisioned hypothetical (i.e. counterfactual) dynamic treatment regimes using a combination of drug therapies to manage diabetes: metformin, sulfonylurea and SGLT-2i. The binary outcome of diabetes care provisions was defined using a composite measure of chronic disease prevention and screening elements [27] including (i) primary care visit, (ii) blood pressure, (iii) weight, (iv) hemoglobin A1c, (v) lipid, (vi) ACR, (vii) eGFR and (viii) statin medication. We used several statistical learning algorithms to describe causal relationships between the prescription of three common classes of diabetes medications and quality of diabetes care using the electronic health records contained in National Diabetes Repository. In particular, we generated an ensemble of statistical learning algorithms using the SuperLearner framework based on the following base learners: (i) least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, (ii) ridge regression, (iii) elastic net, (iv) random forest, (v) gradient boosting machines, and (vi) neural network. Each statistical learning algorithm was fitted using the pseudo-population generated from the marginalization of the time-dependent confounding process. Covariate balance was assessed using the longitudinal (i.e. cumulative-time product) stabilized weights with calibrated restrictions. Our results indicated that the treatment drop-in cohorts (with respect to metformin, sulfonylurea and SGLT-2i) may have improved diabetes care provisions in relation to treatment naive (i.e. no treatment) cohort. As a clinical utility, we hope that this article will facilitate discussions around the prevention of adverse chronic outcomes associated with type II diabetes through the improvement of diabetes care provisions in primary care.

Two-stage residual inclusion estimation: Addressing endogeneity in health econometric modeling	JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS			English	Article						causal effects; instrumental variables; confounding	GENDER ECONOMICS COURSES; COUNT DATA MODELS; ILLICIT DRUG-USE; GENERALIZED-METHOD; CONTRACEPTIVE USE; MORAL-HAZARD; CARE; EMPLOYMENT; SELECTION; ALCOHOL	The paper focuses on two estimation methods that have been widely used to address endogeneity in empirical research in health economics and health services research-two-stage predictor substitution (2SPS) and two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI). 2SPS is the rote extension (to nonlinear models) of the popular linear two-stage least squares estimator. The 2SRI estimator is similar except that in the second-stage regression, the endogenous variables are not replaced by first-stage predictors. Instead, first-stage residuals are included as additional regressors. In a generic parametric framework, we show that 2SRI is consistent and 2SPS is not. Results from a simulation study and an illustrative example also recommend against 2SPS and favor 2SRI. Our findings are important given that there are many prominent examples of the application of inconsistent 2SPS in the recent literature. This study can be used as a guide by future researchers in health economics who are confronted with endogeneity in their empirical work. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In a TND study, individuals who experience symptoms and seek care are recruited and tested for the infectious disease which defines cases and controls. Despite TND's potential to reduce unobserved differences in healthcare seeking behavior (HSB) between vaccinated and unvaccinated subjects, it remains subject to various potential biases. First, residual confounding may remain due to unobserved HSB, occupation as healthcare worker, or previous infection history. Second, because selection into the TND sample is a common consequence of infection and HSB, collider stratification bias may exist when conditioning the analysis on tested samples, which further induces confounding by latent HSB. In this paper, we present a novel approach to identify and estimate vaccine effectiveness in the target population by carefully leveraging a pair of negative control exposure and outcome variables to account for potential hidden bias in TND studies. We illustrate our proposed method with extensive simulations and an application to study COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness using data from the University of Michigan Health System.

Adjusting for unmeasured confounding in nonrandomized longitudinal studies: a methodological review	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Review						Method review; Unmeasured confounding; Unobserved confounding; Longitudinal; Observational data; Electronic health records	PROPENSITY SCORE METHODS; PANEL-DATA; BIAS; ADJUSTMENT; MODELS	Objectives: Motivated by recent calls to use electronic health records for research, we reviewed the application and development of methods for addressing the bias from unmeasured confounding in longitudinal data. Study Design and Setting: Methodological review of existing literature. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for articles addressing the threat to causal inference from unmeasured confounding in nonrandomized longitudinal health data through quasi-experimental analysis. Results: Among the 121 studies included for review, 84 used instrumental variable analysis (IVA), of which 36 used lagged or historical instruments. Difference-in-differences (DiD) and fixed effects (FE) models were found in 29 studies. Five of these combined IVA with DiD or FE to try to mitigate for time-dependent confounding. Other less frequently used methods included prior event rate ratio adjustment, regression discontinuity nested within pre-post studies, propensity score calibration, perturbation analysis, and negative control outcomes. Conclusion: Well-established econometric methods such as DiD and IVA are commonly used to address unmeasured confounding in nonrandomized longitudinal studies, but researchers often fail to take full advantage of available longitudinal information. A range of promising new methods have been developed, but further studies are needed to understand their relative performance in different contexts before they can be recommended for widespread use.

The influence of cluster-constant confounders can be eliminated by studying the exposure-outcome association within (conditional on) clusters, but additional regression modeling is usually required to control for observed cluster-varying confounders. A problem is that the working regression model may be misspecified, in which case the estimated within-cluster association may be biased. To reduce sensitivity to model misspecification we propose to augment the standard working model for the outcome with an auxiliary working model for the exposure. We derive a doubly robust conditional generalized estimating equation (DRCGEE) estimator for the within-cluster association. This estimator combines the two models in such a way that it is consistent if either model is correct, not necessarily both. Thus, the DRCGEE estimator gives the researcher two chances instead of only one to make valid inference on the within-cluster association. We have implemented the estimator in an R package and we use it to examine the association between smoking during pregnancy and cognitive abilities in offspring, in a sample of siblings.

Although certain functions will require investigator intervention, confounding control is one area that can largely be automated. The high-dimensional propensity score (hd-PS) algorithm is one option for automated confounding control in longitudinal healthcare databases. In this article, we discuss the use of hd-PS for automating confounding control in sequential database cohort studies, as applied to safety monitoring systems. In particular, we discuss the robustness of the covariate selection process, the potential for over- or under-selection of variables including the possibilities of M-bias and Z-bias, the computation requirements, the practical considerations in a federated database network, and the cases where automated confounding adjustment may not function optimally. We also outline recent improvements to the algorithm and show how the algorithm has performed in several published studies. We conclude that despite certain limitations, hd-PS offers substantial advantages over non-automated alternatives in active product safety monitoring systems.

Methodological Challenges When Studying Distance to Care as an Exposure in Health Research	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						causal diagrams; causal inference; distance to care; identifiability conditions; instrumental variables; selectionbias; unmeasured confounding; well-defined interventions	CAUSAL INFERENCE; MATERNAL MORTALITY; BIRTH OUTCOMES; OBSTETRIC CARE; DEFINITION; HIV; INTERGROWTH-21ST; ASSUMPTION; PREVENTION; TANZANIA	Distance to care is a common exposure and proposed instrumental variable in health research, but it is vulnerable to violations of fundamental identifiability conditions for causal inference. We used data collected from the Botswana Birth Outcomes Surveillance study between 2014 and 2016 to outline 4 challenges and potential biases when using distance to care as an exposure and as a proposed instrument: selection bias, unmeasured confounding, lack of sufficiently well-defined interventions, and measurement error. We describe how these issues can arise, and we propose sensitivity analyses for estimating the degree of bias.

Selecting Shrinkage Parameters for Effect Estimation The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						confounding factors (epidemiology); LASSO; model selection; shrinkage estimators	BAYESIAN-ADJUSTMENT; MODEL SELECTION; REGRESSION; UNCERTAINTY	We present a method for improving estimation in linear regression models in samples of moderate size, using shrinkage techniques. Our work connects the theory of causal inference, which describes how variable adjustment should be performed with large samples, with shrinkage estimators such as ridge regression and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), which can perform better in sample sizes seen in epidemiologic practice. Shrinkagemethods reduce mean squared error by trading off some amount of bias for a reduction in variance. However, when inference is the goal, there are no standard methods for choosing the penalty "tuning" parameters that govern these tradeoffs. We propose selecting the penalty parameters for these shrinkage estimators by minimizing bias and variance in future similar data sets drawn from the posterior predictive distribution. Our method provides both the point estimate of interest and corresponding standard error estimates. Through simulations, we demonstrate that it can achieve better mean squared error than using cross-validation for penalty parameter selection. We apply our method to a cross-sectional analysis of the association between smoking and carotid intima-media thickness in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (multiple US locations, 2000-2002) and compare it with similar analyses of these data.

Confounding in Statistical Mediation Analysis: What It Is and How to Address It	JOURNAL OF COUNSELING PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						mediation; causal inference; confounder adjustment	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; PREVENTION PROGRAM; CAUSAL INFERENCE; BIAS FORMULAS; SELF-EFFICACY; IDENTIFICATION; INTERVENTION; CHILDREN; DESIGN	Psychology researchers are often interested in mechanisms underlying how randomized interventions affect outcomes such as substance use and mental health. Mediation analysis is a common statistical method for investigating psychological mechanisms that has benefited from exciting new methodological improvements over the last 2 decades. One of the most important new developments is methodology for estimating causal mediated effects using the potential outcomes framework for causal inference. Potential outcomes-based methods developed in epidemiology and statistics have important implications for understanding psychological mechanisms. We aim to provide a concise introduction to and illustration of these new methods and emphasize the importance of confounder adjustment. First, we review the traditional regression approach for estimating mediated effects. Second, we describe the potential outcomes framework. Third, we define what a confounder is and how the presence of a confounder can provide misleading evidence regarding mechanisms of interventions. Fourth, we describe experimental designs that can help rule out confounder bias. Fifth, we describe new statistical approaches to adjust for measured confounders of the mediator-outcome relation and sensitivity analyses to probe effects of unmeasured confounders on the mediated effect. All approaches are illustrated with application to a real counseling intervention dataset. Counseling psychologists interested in understanding the causal mechanisms of their interventions can benefit from incorporating the most up-to-date techniques into their mediation analyses.

Propensity score (PS) methods can be used to achieve comparability of treated and nontreated groups in terms of their observed covariates and, as such, control for confounding in estimating treatment effects. In this article, we provide a step-by-step guidance on how to use PS methods. For illustrative purposes, we used simulated data based on an observational study of the relation between oral nutritional supplementation and hospital length of stay. We focused on the key aspects of PS analysis, including covariate selection, PS estimation, covariate balance assessment, treatment effect estimation, and reporting. PS matching, stratification, covariate adjustment, and weighting are discussed. R codes and example data are provided to show the different steps in a PS analysis.	[Ali, M.

Controlling for time-dependent confounding using marginal structural models	STATA JOURNAL			English	Article						st0075; marginal structural models; causal models; weighted regression; survival analysis; logistic regression; confounding		Longitudinal studies in which exposures, confounders, and outcomes are measured repeatedly over time have the potential to allow causal inferences about the effects of exposure on outcome. There is particular interest in estimating the causal effects of medical treatments (or other interventions) in circumstances in which a randomized controlled trial is difficult or impossible. However, standard methods for estimating exposure effects in longitudinal studies are biased in the presence of time-dependent confounders affected by prior treatment. This article describes the use of marginal structural models (described by Robins, Hern'an, and Brumback [2000]) to estimate exposure or treatment effects in the presence of time-dependent confounders affected by prior treatment. The method is based on deriving inverse-probability-of-treatment weights, which are then used in a pooled logistic regression model to estimate the causal effect of treatment on outcome. We demonstrate the use of marginal structural models to estimate the effect of methotrexate on mortality in persons suffering from rheumatoid arthritis.

Sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding in a marginal structural Cox proportional hazards model	LIFETIME DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Sensitivity analysis; Selection bias; Unmeasured confounding	CAUSAL INFERENCE; LIFE EVENTS; SMOKING; EPIDEMIOLOGY; DEPRESSION; SYMPTOMS; EXPOSURE; PERIOD; BIASES; MEN	Sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding should be reported more often, especially in observational studies. In the standard Cox proportional hazards model, this requires substantial assumptions and can be computationally difficult. The marginal structural Cox proportional hazards model (Cox proportional hazards MSM) with inverse probability weighting has several advantages compared to the standard Cox model, including situations with only one assessment of exposure (point exposure) and time-independent confounders. We describe how simple computations provide sensitivity for unmeasured confounding in a Cox proportional hazards MSM with point exposure. This is achieved by translating the general framework for sensitivity analysis for MSMs by Robins and colleagues to survival time data. Instead of bias-corrected observations, we correct the hazard rate to adjust for a specified amount of unmeasured confounding. As an additional bonus, the Cox proportional hazards MSM is robust against bias from differential loss to follow-up. As an illustration, the Cox proportional hazards MSM was applied in a reanalysis of the association between smoking and depression in a population-based cohort of Norwegian adults. The association was moderately sensitive for unmeasured confounding.

We investigate the direction of causation between vitamin D and CRC by extending the conventional approaches to allow pleiotropic relationships and by explicitly modelling unmeasured confounders. Methods: Plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), genetic variants associated with 25-OHD and CRC, and other relevant information was available for 2645 individuals (1057 CRC cases and 1588 controls) and included in the model. We investigate whether 25-OHD is likely to be causally associated with CRC, or vice versa, by selecting the best modelling hypothesis according to Bayesian predictive scores. We examine consistency for a range of prior assumptions. Results: Model comparison showed preference for the causal association between low 25-OHD and CRC over the reverse causal hypothesis. This was confirmed for posterior mean deviances obtained for both models (11.5 natural log units in favour of the causal model), and also for deviance information criteria (DIC) computed for a range of prior distributions. Overall, models ignoring hidden confounding or pleiotropy had significantly poorer DIC scores. Conclusion: Results suggest causal association between 25-OHD and colorectal cancer, and support the need for randomised clinical trials for further confirmations.

By compiling narratives written by us, his colleagues, we not only present highlights of Marshall's research and their significance for causal inference but also offer a portrayal of Marshall's personal accomplishments and character. Our discussion of Marshall's research notably includes (but is not limited to) handling of posttreatment variables such as noncompliance, employing G-estimation for treatment effects on failure-time outcomes, estimating effects of time-varying exposures subject to time-dependent confounding, and developing a causal framework for case-control studies. We also provide a description of some of Marshall's unpublished work, which is accompanied by a bonus anecdote. We discuss future research directions related to Marshall's research. While Marshall's impact in causal inference and the world outside of it cannot be wholly captured by our words, we hope nonetheless to present some of what he has done for our field and what he has meant to us and to his loved ones.

The identification of causal components of mixtures requires accurate measurements of all components, an appreciation of the sources from which they derive and resulting correlations between components. Recent work has suggested that the usual methods of handling multiple exposures in statistical models is much more complicated than in classical problems, such as considering alcohol as a confounding factor in the association between tobacco smoking and breast cancer. Herein, we use directed acyclic graphs (DAG) to analyse several hypothetical examples to illustrate the problems encountered in the statistical analysis of pollutant mixtures. In some instances, the results may be biased regardless as to whether one adjusts or does not adjust for co-exposures. We suggest that use of markers that are amenable to public health interventions may reduce this problem. Before starting a study one should identify the key environmental sources, develop a DAG to assist with framing the statistical models, estimate correlations between components, report results for all measured components (e.g., unadjusted and adjusted for each other), and incorporate toxicological and mechanistic investigations. As it is likely that one may not know what the "correct" model is, one could consider reporting different models containing various combinations of the measured exposure variables.

The causal influence of brain size on human intelligence: Evidence from within-family phenotypic associations and GWAS modeling	INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Intelligence; Brain size; Cognitive evolution; Statistical genetics; Causal inference	GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; COGNITIVE-ABILITY; SCORE REGRESSION; VOLUME; PLEIOTROPY; COMMON; LOCI; TWIN; METAANALYSIS; INSIGHTS	There exists a moderate correlation between MRI-measured brain size and the general factor of IQ performance (g), but the question of whether the association reflects a theoretically important causal relationship or spurious confounding remains somewhat open. Previous small studies (n <100) looking for the persistence of this correlation within families failed to find a tendency for the sibling with the larger brain to obtain a higher test score. We studied the within-family relationship between brain volume and intelligence in the much larger sample provided by the Human Connectome Project (n = 1022) and found a highly significant correlation (disattenuated rho = 0.18, p < .001). We replicated this result in the Minnesota Center for Twin and Family Research (n = 2698), finding a highly significant within-family correlation between head circumference and intelligence (disattenuated rho = 0.19, p < .001). We also employed novel methods of causal inference relying on summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of head size (n approximate to 10,000) and measures of cognition (257,000 < n < 767,000). Using bivariate LD Score regression, we found a genetic correlation between intracranial volume (ICV) and years of education (EduYears) of 0.41 (p < .001). Using the Latent Causal Variable method, we found a genetic causality proportion of 0.72 (p < .001); thus the genetic correlation arises from an asymmetric pattern, extending to sub-significant loci, of genetic variants associated with ICV also being associated with EduYears but many genetic variants associated with EduYears not being associated with ICV. This is the pattern of genetic results expected from a causal effect of brain size on intelligence. These findings give reason to take up the hypothesis that the dramatic increase in brain volume over the course of human evolution has been the result of natural selection favoring general intelligence.

We provide an introduction to the theory of RD and a systematic review and assessment of the RD literature in medicine, epidemiology, and public health. Study Design and Setting: We review the necessary conditions for valid RD results, provide a practical guide to RD implementation, compare RD to other methodologies, and conduct a systematic review of the RD literature in PubMed. Results: We describe five key elements of analysis all RD studies should report, including tests of validity conditions and robustness checks. Thirty two empirical RD studies in PubMed met our selection criteria. Most of the 32 RD articles analyzed the effectiveness of social policies or mental health interventions, with only two evaluating clinical interventions to improve physical health. Seven out of the 32 studies reported on all the five key elements. Conclusion: Increased use of RD provides an exciting opportunity for obtaining unbiased causal effect estimates when experiments are not feasible or when we want to evaluate programs under "real-life" conditions. Although treatment eligibility in medicine, epidemiology, and public health is commonly determined by threshold rules, use of RD in these fields has been very limited until now. (C) 2015 The Authors.

PROG-IMT Study Grp	Multiple imputation for handling systematically missing confounders in meta-analysis of individual participant data	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						missing data; IPD meta-analysis; multilevel model; multiple imputation: chained equations	INTIMA-MEDIA THICKNESS; PATIENT DATA; CAROTID ATHEROSCLEROSIS; RISK; SURVIVAL; MODEL; PROGRESSION; PREDICTION; DISEASE; TRIALS	A variable is systematically missing' if it is missing for all individuals within particular studies in an individual participant data meta-analysis. When a systematically missing variable is a potential confounder in observational epidemiology, standard methods either fail to adjust the exposure-disease association for the potential confounder or exclude studies where it is missing. We propose a new approach to adjust for systematically missing confounders based on multiple imputation by chained equations. Systematically missing data are imputed via multilevel regression models that allow for heterogeneity between studies. A simulation study compares various choices of imputation model. An illustration is given using data from eight studies estimating the association between carotid intima media thickness and subsequent risk of cardiovascular events. Results are compared with standard methods and also with an extension of a published method that exploits the relationship between fully adjusted and partially adjusted estimated effects through a multivariate random effects meta-analysis model. We conclude that multiple imputation provides a practicable approach that can handle arbitrary patterns of systematic missingness. Bias is reduced by including sufficient between-study random effects in the imputation model. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Double Bias: Estimation of Causal Effects from Length-Biased Samples in the Presence of Confounding	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOSTATISTICS			English	Article						Causal Inference; Length-biased Sampling; Propensity Score; Cox Proportional Hazard model; Accelerated Failure Time model	PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS REGRESSION; NONPARAMETRIC-ESTIMATION; PREVALENT COHORT; PROPENSITY SCORE; SURVIVAL CURVES; LIKELIHOOD; MODELS; STATIONARITY; STATISTICS	Length bias in survival data occurs in observational studies when, for example, subjects with shorter lifetimes are less likely to be present in the recorded data. In this paper, we consider estimating the causal exposure (treatment) effect on survival time from observational data when, in addition to the lack of randomization and consequent potential for confounding, the data constitute a length-biased sample; we hence term this a double-bias problem. We develop estimating equations that can be used to estimate the causal effect indexing the structural Cox proportional hazard and accelerated failure time models for point exposures in double-bias settings. The approaches rely on propensity score-based adjustments, and we demonstrate that estimation of the propensity score must be adjusted to acknowledge the length-biased sampling. Large sample properties of the estimators are established and their small sample behavior is studied using simulations. We apply the proposed methods to a set of, partly synthesized, length-biased survival data collected as part of the Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA) to compare survival of subjects with dementia among institutionalized patients versus those recruited from the community and depict their adjusted survival curves.

Under the unconfoundedness assumption, matching methods are popular because they can be used to emulate an RCT that is hidden in the observational study. To ensure the key assumption hold, the effort is often made to collect a large number of possible confounders, rendering dimension reduction imperative in matching. Three matching schemes based on the propensity score (PSM), prognostic score (PGM), and double score (DSM, ie, the collection of the first two scores) have been proposed in the literature. However, a comprehensive comparison is lacking among the three matching schemes and has not made inroads into the best practices including variable selection, choice of caliper, and replacement. In this article, we explore the statistical and numerical properties of PSM, PGM, and DSM via extensive simulations. Our study supports that DSM performs favorably with, if not better than, the two single score matching in terms of bias and variance. In particular, DSM is doubly robust in the sense that the matching estimator is consistent requiring either the propensity score model or the prognostic score model is correctly specified. Variable selection on the propensity score model and matching with replacement is suggested for DSM, and we illustrate the recommendations with comprehensive simulation studies.

However, traditional approaches do not always deliver unconfounded causal conclusions in practice. The rise of "doubly robust" nonparametric tools coupled with the growth of deep learning for capturing rich representations of multimodal data offers a unique opportunity to develop and test such models for causal inference on comprehensive electronic health records (EHRs). In this article, we investigate causal modeling of an RCT-established causal association: the effect of classes of antihypertensive on incident cancer risk. We develop a transformer-based model, targeted bidirectional EHR transformer (T-BEHRT) coupled with doubly robust estimation to estimate average risk ratio (RR). We compare our model to benchmark statistical and deep learning models for causal inference in multiple experiments on semi-synthetic derivations of our dataset with various types and intensities of confounding. In order to further test the reliability of our approach, we test our model on situations of limited data. We find that our model provides more accurate estimates of relative risk least sum absolute error (SAE) from ground truth compared with benchmark estimations. Finally, our model provides an estimate of class-wise antihypertensive effect on cancer risk that is consistent with results derived from RCTs.

The effect of relationship status on health with dynamic health and persistent relationships	JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS			English	Article						Endogenous dummy variables; Dynamic panel data; Health and marriage	HOUSEHOLD PANEL SURVEY; MARITAL TRANSITIONS; MODELS; SELECTION; INSURANCE; VARIABLES; MORTALITY; MARRIAGE; WOMEN	The dynamic evolution of health and persistent relationship status pose econometric challenges to disentangling the causal effect of relationships on health from the selection effect of health on relationship choice. Using a new econometric strategy we find that marriage is not universally better for health. Rather, cohabitation benefits the health of men and women over 45, being never married is no worse for health, and only divorce marginally harms the health of younger men. We find strong evidence that unobservable health-related factors can confound estimates. Our method can be applied to other research questions with dynamic dependent and multivariate endogenous variables. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The problem of unmeasured confounding in settings with multiple treatments is most common in statistical genetics and bioinformatics settings, where researchers have developed many successful statistical strategies without engaging deeply with the causal aspects of the problem. Recently there have been a number of attempts to bridge the gap between these statistical approaches and causal inference, but these attempts have either been shown to be flawed or have relied on fully parametric assumptions. In this article, we propose two strategies for identifying and estimating causal effects of multiple treatments in the presence of unmeasured confounding. The auxiliary variables approach leverages variables that are not causally associated with the outcome; in the case of a univariate confounder, our method only requires one auxiliary variable, unlike existing instrumental variable methods that would require as many instruments as there are treatments. An alternative null treatments approach relies on the assumption that at least half of the confounded treatments have no causal effect on the outcome, but does not require a priori knowledge of which treatments are null. Our identification strategies do not impose parametric assumptions on the outcome model and do not rest on estimation of the confounder. This article extends and generalizes existing work on unmeasured confounding with a single treatment and models commonly used in bioinformatics. for this article are available online.

J	Norström, F; Hammarström, A				Norstrom, Fredrik; Hammarstrom, Anne			Methodological perspectives on the study of the health effects of unemployment - reviewing the mode of unemployment, the statistical analysis method and the role of confounding factors	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Unemployment; Labour market; Propensity score weighting; G-computation; Biased estimates	PROPENSITY SCORE METHODS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; REGRESSION; QUALITY	Introduction Studying the relationship between unemployment and health raises many methodological challenges. In the current study, the aim was to evaluate the sensitivity of estimates based on different ways of measuring unemployment and the choice of statistical model. Methods The Northern Swedish cohort was used, and two follow-up surveys thereof from 1995 and 2007, as well as register data about unemployment. Self-reported current unemployment, self-reported accumulated unemployment and register-based accumulated unemployment were used to measure unemployment and its effect on self-reported health was evaluated. Analyses were conducted with G-computation, logistic regression and three estimators for the inverse probability weighting propensity scores, and 11 potentially confounding variables were part of the analyses. Results were presented with absolute differences in the proportion with poor self-reported health between unemployed and employed individuals, except when logistic regression was used alone. Results Of the initial 1083 pupils in the cohort, our analyses vary between 488-693 individuals defined as employed and 61-214 individuals defined as unemployed. In the analyses, the deviation was large between the unemployment measures, with a difference of at least 2.5% in effect size when unemployed was compared with employed for the self-reported and register-based unemployment modes. The choice of statistical method only had a small influence on effect estimates and the deviation was in most cases lower than 1%. When models were compared based on the choice of potential confounders in the analytical model, the deviations were rarely above 0.6% when comparing models with 4 and 11 potential confounders. Our variable for health selection was the only one that strongly affected estimates when it was not part of the statistical model. Conclusions How unemployment is measured is highly important when the relationship between unemployment and health is estimated. However, misspecifications of the statistical model or choice of analytical method might not matter much for estimates except for the inclusion of a variable measuring health status before becoming unemployed. Our results can guide researchers when analysing similar research questions. Model diagnostics is commonly lacking in publications, but they remain very important for validation of analyses.

Even in randomized studies the mediator may still be correlated with unobserved prognostic variables that affect the outcome, in which case the mediator's role in the causal process may not be inferred without bias. In the behavioural and social science literature very little attention has been given so far to the causal assumptions required for moderated mediation analysis. In this paper we focus on the index for moderated mediation, which measures by how much the mediated effect is larger or smaller for varying levels of the moderator. We show that in linear models this index can be estimated without bias in the presence of unmeasured common causes of the moderator, mediator and outcome under certain conditions. Importantly, one can thus use the test for moderated mediation to support evidence for mediation under less stringent confounding conditions. We illustrate our findings with data from a randomized experiment assessing the impact of being primed with social deception upon observer responses to others' pain, and from an observational study of individuals who ended a romantic relationship assessing the effect of attachment anxiety during the relationship on mental distress 2years after the break-up.

Statistical modeling of causal effects in continuous time	ANNALS OF STATISTICS			English	Article						causality in continuous time; counterfactuals; longitudinal data; observational studies	CONFOUNDING FACTORS; INFERENCE; SURVIVAL	This article studies the estimation of the causal effect of a time-varying treatment on time-to-an-event or on some other continuously distributed outcome. The paper applies to the situation where treatment is repeatedly adapted to time-dependent patient characteristics. The treatment effect cannot be estimated by simply conditioning on these time-dependent patient characteristics, as they may themselves be indications of the treatment effect. This time-dependent confounding is common in observational studies. Robins [(1992) Biometrika 79 321-334, (1998b) Encyclopedia of Biostatistics 6 4372-4389] has proposed the so-called structural nested models to estimate treatment effects in the presence of time-dependent confounding. In this article we provide a conceptual framework and formalization for structural nested models in continuous time. We show that the resulting estimators are consistent and asymptotically normal. Moreover, as conjectured in Robins [(1998b) Encyclopedia of Biostatistics 6 4372-4389], a test for whether treatment affects the outcome of interest can be performed without specifying a model for treatment effect. We illustrate the ideas in this article with an example.	Harvard Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Biostat, Boston, MA 02115 USA	Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

J	Jimenez, M; Dietrich, T				Jimenez, Monik; Dietrich, Thomas			Regression models in periodontal epidemiology: purpose, approach and interpretation	PERIODONTOLOGY 2000			English	Article							DISEASE	Statistical models, including those using regression analyses, are ubiquitous in periodontal research. However, many investigators may not have a thorough understanding of the concepts underlying the complex statistical models used in much of the current literature. This review aims to demystify biostatical regression models and familiarize the reader with the regression models most commonly encountered in the periodontal literature. Complex models can be intuitively understood in terms of stratified analyses. Therefore, we discuss the use of stratified analyses and emphasize their natural connection to regression models using examples from the periodontal research literature. We critically review various types of regression models, as well as the fundamental assumptions unique to each. An introduction to the fundamentals of model building describes the basics of variable selection procedures and variable management, including discussions regarding the assumptions inherent in common practices. Lastly, modeling approaches to assess confounding and effect modification are discussed by use of examples from the periodontal epidemiological literature.

J	Shahar, E				Shahar, Eyal			Causal diagrams for encoding and evaluation of information bias	JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE			English	Article						causal diagram; information bias; surrogate variables	STRUCTURAL APPROACH	Epidemiologists and clinical researchers usually classify bias into three main categories: confounding, selection bias and information bias. Previous authors have described the first two categories in the logic and notation of causal diagrams, formally known as directed acyclic graphs (DAG). I examine common types of information bias - disease-related and exposure-related - from the perspective of causal diagrams. Disease or exposure information bias always involves the use of an effect of the variable of interest - specifically, an effect of true disease status or an effect of true exposure status. The bias typically arises from a causal or an associational path of no interest to the researchers. In certain situations, it may be possible to prevent or remove some of the bias. Common types of information bias, just like confounding and selection bias, have a clear and helpful representation within the framework of causal diagrams.

We provide a clear, structured overview of key concepts and terms, intended as a starting point for readers unfamiliar with the causal inference literature. First, we introduce theoretical frameworks underlying causal effect estimation methods: the counterfactual theory of causation, the potential outcomes framework, structural equations and directed acyclic graphs. Second, we define the most common causal effect estimands, and the issues of effect measure modification, interaction and mediation (direct and indirect effects). Third, we define the assumptions required to estimate causal effects: exchangeability, positivity, consistency and non-interference. Fourth, we define and explain biases that arise when attempting to estimate causal effects, including confounding, collider bias, selection bias and measurement bias. Finally, we describe common methods and study designs for causal effect estimation, including covariate adjustment, G-methods and natural experiment methods.

Clarifying the language barrier between epidemiologists and economists	HEALTH SERVICES AND OUTCOMES RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Selection bias; Confounding; Omitted variable bias; Endogeneity; Epidemiology; Health economics	PROPENSITY SCORE METHODS; SELECTION BIAS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; ENDOGENEITY	In health intervention research, epidemiologists and economists are more and more interested in estimating causal effects based on observational data. However, collaboration and interaction between both disciplines are regularly clouded by differences in the terminology used. Amongst others, this is reflected in differences in labeling, handling, and interpreting the sources of bias in parameter estimates. For example, both epidemiologists and economists use the term selection bias. However, what economists label as selection bias is labeled as confounding by epidemiologists. This paper aims to shed light on this and other subtle differences between both fields and illustrate them with hypothetical examples. We expect that clarification of these differences will improve the multidisciplinary collaboration between epidemiologists and economists. Furthermore, we hope to empower researchers to select the most suitable analytical technique from either field for the research problem at hand.	[Varga, A. N.; Morel, A. E. Guevara; van Dongen, J.

Treatment Effects in the Presence of Unmeasured Confounding: Dealing With Observations in the Tails of the Propensity Score Distribution-A Simulation Study	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						bias (epidemiology); causal inference; cohort studies; confounding factors (epidemiology); epidemiologic methods; models, statistical; propensity score; research design	ADJUSTMENT; MORTALITY	Frailty, a poorly measured confounder in older patients, can promote treatment in some situations and discourage it in others. This can create unmeasured confounding and lead to nonuniform treatment effects over the propensity score (PS). The authors compared bias and mean squared error for various PS implementations under PS trimming, thereby excluding persons treated contrary to prediction. Cohort studies were simulated with a binary treatment T as a function of 8 covariates X. Two of the covariates were assumed to be unmeasured strong risk factors for the outcome and present in persons treated contrary to prediction. The outcome Y was simulated as a Poisson function of T and all X's. In analyses based on measured covariates only, the range of PS's was trimmed asymmetrically according to the percentile of PS in treated patients at the lower end and in untreated patients at the upper end. PS trimming reduced bias due to unmeasured confounders and mean squared error in most scenarios assessed. Treatment effect estimates based on PS range restrictions do not correspond to a causal parameter but may be less biased by such unmeasured confounding. Increasing validity based on PS trimming may be a unique advantage of PS's over conventional outcome models.

Tchetgen			Proximal causal inference for complex longitudinal studies	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY			English	Article						double robustness; longitudinal data; marginal structural mean model; proximal causal inference; semiparametric theory; unmeasured confounding	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; TIME-SERIES; IDENTIFICATION; MORTALITY; VARIABLES; BIAS	A standard assumption for causal inference about the joint effects of time-varying treatment is that one has measured sufficient covariates to ensure that within covariate strata, subjects are exchangeable across observed treatment values, also known as 'sequential randomization assumption (SRA)'. SRA is often criticized as it requires one to accurately measure all confounders. Realistically, measured covariates can rarely capture all confounders with certainty. Often covariate measurements are at best proxies of confounders, thus invalidating inferences under SRA. In this paper, we extend the proximal causal inference (PCI) framework of Miao, Geng, et al. (2018. Identifying causal effects with proxy variables of an unmeasured confounder. Biometrika, 105(4), 987-993. ) to the longitudinal setting under a semiparametric marginal structural mean model (MSMM). PCI offers an opportunity to learn about joint causal effects in settings where SRA based on measured time-varying covariates fails, by formally accounting for the covariate measurements as imperfect proxies of underlying confounding mechanisms. We establish nonparametric identification with a pair of time-varying proxies and provide a corresponding characterization of regular and asymptotically linear estimators of the parameter indexing the MSMM, including a rich class of doubly robust estimators, and establish the corresponding semiparametric efficiency bound for the MSMM. Extensive simulation studies and a data application illustrate the finite sample behaviour of proposed methods.	[Ying, Andrew; Tchetgen, Eric J.

This definition captures selection bias under both the structural approach (where conditioning on selection into the study opens a noncausal path from exposure to disease in a directed acyclic graph) and the traditional definition (where a given measure of association differs between the study sample and the population eligible for inclusion). This approach is nonparametric, and selection bias under the approach can be analyzed using single-world intervention graphs both under and away from the null hypothesis. It allows the simultaneous analysis of confounding and selection bias, it explicitly links the selection of study participants to the estimation of causal effects using study data, and it can be adapted to handle selection bias in descriptive epidemiology. Through examples, we show that this approach provides a novel perspective on the variety of mechanisms that can generate selection bias and simplifies the analysis of selection bias in matched studies and case-cohort studies.

Existing summary-level MR methods often rely on strong assumptions, resulting in many false-positive findings. To relax MR assumptions, ongoing research has been primarily focused on accounting for confounding due to pleiotropy. Here, we show that sample structure is another major confounding factor, including population stratification, cryptic relatedness, and sample overlap. We propose a unified MR approach, MR-APSS, which 1) accounts for pleiotropy and sample structure simultaneously by leveraging genome-wide information; and 2) allows the inclusion of more genetic variants with moderate effects as instrument variables (IVs) to improve statistical power without inflating type I errors. We first evaluated MR-APSS using comprehensive simulations and negative controls and then applied MR-APSS to study the causal relationships among a collection of diverse complex traits. The results suggest that MR-APSS can better identify plausible causal relationships with high reliability. In particular, MR-APSS can perform well for highly polygenic traits, where the IV strengths tend to be relatively weak and existing summary-level MR methods for causal inference are vulnerable to confounding effects.

J	Etminan, M; Collins, GS; Mansournia, MA				Etminan, Mahyar; Collins, Gary S.; Mansournia, Mohammad Ali			Using Causal Diagrams to Improve the Design and Interpretation of Medical Research	CHEST			English	Article						causal directed acyclic graphs; colliders; confounding; detection bias; overadjustment bias; selection bias		Causal directed acyclic graphs (cDAGs) have become popular tools for researchers to better examine biases related to causal questions. DAGs comprise a series of arrows connecting nodes that represent variables and in doi ng so can demonstrate the causal relation between different variables. cDAGs can provide researchers with a blueprint of the exposure and outcome relation and the other variables that play a role in that causal question. cDAGs can be helpful in the design and interpretation of observational studies in pulmonary, critical care, sleep, and cardiovascular medicine. They can also help clinicians and researchers to better identify the structure of different biases that can affect the validity of observational studies. Most of the available literature on cDAGs and their function use language that might be unfamiliar to clinicians. This article explains cDAG terminology and the principles behind how they work. We use cDAGs and clinical examples that are mostly focused in the area of pulmonary medicine to describe the structure of confounding, selection bias, overadjustment bias, and detection bias. These principles are then applied to a more complex published case study on the use of statins and COPD mortality.

Complications arising from the 'stickiness' of ZNA	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Residence characteristics; Housing; Social epidemiology; Causal inference; Confounding factors; Obesity; Social mobility	SOCIOECONOMIC CONTEXT; SOCIAL-ENVIRONMENT; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; HEALTH BEHAVIORS; OBESITY; POVERTY; MULTILEVEL; CULTURE; ORIGINS; FAMINE	Are neighborhoods causal? The answer remains elusive. Armed with new multilevel methods, enthusiasm for neighborhoods research surged at the turn of the century. However, a wave of skepticism has arisen based on the difficulty of drawing causal inferences from observational studies in which selection to neighborhoods is non-random. Researchers have sought answers from experimental and quasi experimental studies of movers vs. stayers. We develop two related concepts in this essay in the hopes of shedding light on this problem. First, the inceptive environment into which persons are born (which we term ZNA for Zip code Nativity Area) exerts a potentially powerful causal impact on health. Detecting that causal effect is challenging for reasons similar that obtain in other fields (including genetics). Second, we explicate the problem of neighborhood 'stickiness' in terms of the persistence of neighborhood treatment assignment, and argue that under-appreciation of stickiness has led to systematic bias in causal estimates of neighborhoods proportional to the degree of stickiness. In sticky contexts, failure to account for the lasting influences of ZNA by adjusting for intermediate individual socioeconomic and health variables on the causal pathway can result in neighborhood effects estimates that are biased toward the null. We follow with an example drawn from evidence of neighborhood 'stickiness' and obesity. The stickiness of ZNA cautions us that experimental evidence may be insufficient or misleading as a solution to causal inference problems in neighborhood research. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Causal analysis approaches in epidemiology	REVUE D EPIDEMIOLOGIE ET DE SANTE PUBLIQUE			French	Article						Causality; Models; Structural; Bias (Epidemiology); Confounding factors ( Epidemiology)	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; DYNAMIC PATH-ANALYSIS; FAILURE-TIME MODELS; INVERSE PROBABILITY; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; RISK; ASSOCIATION; SURVIVAL; ENVIRONMENT	Epidemiological research is mostly based on observational studies. Whether such studies can provide evidence of causation remains discussed. Several causal analysis methods have been developed in epidemiology. This paper aims at presenting an overview of these methods: graphical models, path analysis and its extensions, and models based on the counterfactual approach, with a special emphasis on marginal structural models. Graphical approaches have been developed to allow synthetic representations of supposed causal relationships in a given problem. They serve as qualitative support in the study of causal relationships. The sufficient-component cause model has been developed to deal with the issue of multicausality raised by the emergence of chronic multifactorial diseases. Directed acyclic graphs are mostly used as a visual tool to identify possible confounding sources in a study. Structural equations models, the main extension of path analysis, combine a system of equations and a path diagram, representing a set of possible causal relationships. They allow quantifying direct and indirect effects in a general model in which several relationships can be tested simultaneously. Dynamic path analysis further takes into account the role of time. The counterfactual approach defines causality by comparing the observed event and the counterfactual event (the event that would have been observed if, contrary to the fact, the subject had received a different exposure than the one he actually received). This theoretical approach has shown limits of traditional methods to address some causality questions. In particular, in longitudinal studies, when there is time-varying confounding, classical methods (regressions) may be biased. Marginal structural models have been developed to address this issue. In conclusion, `` causal models'', though they were developed partly independently, are based on equivalent logical foundations. A crucial step in the application of these models is the formulation of causal hypotheses, which will be a basis for all methodological choices. Beyond this step, statistical analysis tools recently developed offer new possibilities to delineate complex relationships, in particular in life course epidemiology. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The data source and analytical opportunities for study create risks that can lead to misinterpretation or bias the results. This review serves as an introduction to the concept of bias and confounding to help researchers conduct methodologically sound pharmacoepidemiologic research projects using administrative databases. Beyond general considerations for observational study, there are several unique issues related to database research that should be addressed. The risks of uninterpretable or biased results can be minimized by: providing a robust description of the data tables used; focusing on why and how they were created; measuring and reporting the accuracy of diagnostic and procedural codes used; and properly accounting for any time-dependent nature of variables. The hallmark of good research is rigorously careful analysis and interpretation. The promise for value of real world evidence using databases in medical decision making must be balanced against concerns related to observational inherited limitations for bias and confounding. Researchers should aim to avoid bias in the design of a study, adjust for confounding, and discuss the effects of residual bias on the results.

A key IV identification condition known as the exclusion restriction states that the IV cannot have a direct effect on the outcome which is not mediated by the exposure in view. In MR studies, such an assumption requires an unrealistic level of prior knowledge about the mechanism by which genetic markers causally affect the outcome. As a result, possible violation of the exclusion restriction can seldom be ruled out in practice. To address this concern, we introduce a new class of IV estimators which are robust to violation of the exclusion restriction under data generating mechanisms commonly assumed in MR literature. The proposed approach named "MR G-Estimation under No Interaction with Unmeasured Selection" (MR GENIUS) improves on Robins' G-estimation by making it robust to both additive unmeasured confounding and violation of the exclusion restriction assumption. In certain key settings, MR GENIUS reduces to the estimator of Lewbel (J. Bus. Econom. Statist. 30 (2012) 67-80) which is widely used in econometrics but appears largely unappreciated in MR literature. More generally, MR GENIUS generalizes Lewbel's estimator to several key practical MR settings, including multiplicative causal models for binary outcome, multiplicative and odds ratio exposure models, case control study design and censored survival outcomes.

Efforts to adjust for confounding by neighborhood using complex survey data	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						confounding; conditional logistic regression; generalized linear mixed models: misspecified mixing distribution; complex survey data: causal inference	LONGITUDINAL DATA; CLUSTERED DATA; MODELS; SELECTION	In social epidemiology, one often considers neighborhood or contextual effects on health outcomes, in addition to effects of individual exposures. This paper is concerned with the estimation of an individual exposure effect in the presence of confounding by neighborhood effects, motivated by an analysis of National health Interview Survey (NHIS) data. In the analysis, we operationalize neighborhood as the secondary sampling unit of the survey, which consists of small groups of neighboring census blocks. Thus the neighborhoods are sampled with unequal probabilities, as are individuals within neighborhoods. We develop and compare several approaches for the analysis of the effect of dichotomized individual-level education on the receipt of adequate mammography screening. In the analysis, neighborhood effects are likely to confound the individual effects, due to such factors as differential availability of health services and differential neighborhood culture. The approaches can be grouped into three broad classes: ordinary logistic regression for survey data, with either no effect or a fixed effect for each cluster; conditional logistic regression extended for survey data; and generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) regression for survey data. Standard use of GLMMs with small clusters fails to adjust for confounding by cluster (e.g. neighborhood); this motivated us to develop an adaptation. We use theory, simulation, and analyses of the NIIIS data to compare and contrast all of these methods. One conclusion is that all of the methods perform poorly when the sampling bias is strong; more research and new methods are clearly needed. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In practice, the most one can hope for is that covariate measurements are at best proxies of the true underlying confounding mechanism operating in a given observational study. In this article, we consider the framework of proximal causal inference introduced by Miao, Geng, and Tchetgen Tchetgen and Tchetgen Tchetgen et al. which while explicitly acknowledging covariate measurements as imperfect proxies of confounding mechanisms, offers an opportunity to learn about causal effects in settings where exchangeability on the basis of measured covariates fails. We make a number of contributions to proximal inference including (i) an alternative set of conditions for nonparametric proximal identification of the average treatment effect; (ii) general semiparametric theory for proximal estimation of the average treatment effect including efficiency bounds for key semiparametric models of interest; (iii) a characterization of proximal doubly robust and locally efficient estimators of the average treatment effect. Moreover, we provide analogous identification and efficiency results for the average treatment effect on the treated. Our approach is illustrated via simulation studies and a data application on evaluating the effectiveness of right heart catheterization in the intensive care unit of critically ill patients. for this article are available online.

These associations are commonly caused by confusion derived from social, environmental, and behavioral factors, which can be difficult to measure. Mendelian randomization is based on the selection of genetic variants that are used as instrumental variables that influence exposure patterns or are associated with an intermediate phenotype of the disease. The present work aims to discuss how to select the appropriate genetic variants as instrumental variables and to present methodological tools to deal with the limitations of this epidemiological method. The use of instrumental variables for modifiable exposures has the potential to mitigate the effects of common limitations, such as confusion, when robust genetic variants are chosen as instrumental variables.

J	Tong, SL; Lu, Y				Tong, SL; Lu, Y			Identification of confounders in the assessment of the relationship between lead exposure and child development	ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						bias (epidemiology); confounding factors (epidemiology); selection criteria; epidemiologic research	PORT-PIRIE; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE; AGE; INTELLIGENCE; COHORT	PURPOSE: To explore the best approach to identify and adjust for confounders in epidemiologic practice METHODS: In the Port Pirie cohort study, the selection of covariates was based on both a priori and an empirical consideration. In an assessment of the relationship between exposure to environmental lead and child development, change-in estimate (CE) and significance testing (ST) criteria were compared in identifying potential confounders. The Pearson correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the potential for collinearity between pairs of major quantitative covariates. In multivariate analyses, the effects of confounding factors were assessed with multiple linear regression models. RESULTS: The nature and number of covariates selected varied with different confounder selection criteria and different cutoffs. Four covariates (i.e., quality of home environment, socioeconomic status (SES), maternal intelligence, and parental smoking behaviour) met the conventional CE criterion (greater than or equal to 10%), whereas 14 variables met the ST criterion (p less than or equal to 0.25). However, the magnitude of the relationship between blood lead concentration and children's IQ differed slightly after adjustment fur confounding, using either the CE (partial regression coefficient: -4.4; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.5 to -8.3) or ST criterion (-4.3; 95% CI: -0.2 to -8.4). CONCLUSIONS: Identification and selection of confounding factors need to be viewed cautiously in epidemiologic studies. Either the CE (e.g., greater than or equal to 10%) or ST (e.g., P less than or equal to 0.25) criterion may be implemented in identification of a potential confounder if a study sample is sufficiently large, and both the methods are subject to arbitrariness of selecting a cut-off point. In this study, the CE criterion (i.e., greater than or equal to 10%) appears to be more stringent than the ST method (i.e., P less than or equal to 0.25) in the identification of confounders. However, the ST rule cannot be used to determine the trueness of confounding because it cannot reflect the causal relationship between the confounder and outcome. This study shows the complexities one can expect to encounter in the identification of and adjustment for confounders. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

The Role of Exchangeability in Causal Inference	STATISTICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Bayesian inference; causal inference; confound-ing; exchangeability; posterior predictive inference	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; PARAMETRIC G-FORMULA; IDENTIFIABILITY; ASSUMPTION; DEFINITION	Though the notion of exchangeability has been discussed in the causal inference literature under various guises, it has rarely taken its orig-inal meaning as a symmetry property of probability distributions. As this property is a standard component of Bayesian inference, we argue that in Bayesian causal inference it is natural to link the causal model, including the notion of confounding and definition of causal contrasts of interest, to the concept of exchangeability. Here, we propose a probabilistic between -group exchangeability property as an identifying condition for causal effects, relate it to alternative conditions for unconfounded inferences (commonly stated using potential outcomes) and define causal contrasts in the presence of exchangeability in terms of posterior predictive expectations for further exchangeable units. While our main focus is on a point treatment setting, we also investigate how this reasoning carries over to longitudinal settings.

The package aims to provide a flexible tool for simplifying the conduct of transparent and reproducible simulation studies, with a particular emphasis on the types of data and interventions frequently encountered in real-world causal inference problems, such as, observational data with time-dependent confounding, selection bias, and random monitoring processes. The package interface allows for concise expression of complex functional dependencies between a large number of nodes, where each node may represent a measurement at a specific time point. The package allows for specification and simulation of counterfactual data under various user-specified interventions (e.g., static, dynamic, deterministic, or stochastic). In particular, the interventions may represent exposures to treatment regimens, the occurrence or non-occurrence of right-censoring events, or of clinical monitoring events. Finally, the package enables the computation of a selected set of user-specified features of the distribution of the counterfactual data that represent common causal quantities of interest, such as, treatment-specific means, the average treatment effects and coefficients from working marginal structural models. The applicability of simcausal is demonstrated by replicating the results of two published simulation studies.

J	Flanders, WD; Ye, DN				Flanders, W.

Here, we consider M-bias, a type of selection bias, described by Hernan et al as a situation wherein bias is caused by selecting on a variable that is caused by two other variables, one a cause of the exposure, the other a cause of the outcome. Our goals are to derive a bound for (the maximum) M-bias, explore through examples the magnitude of M-bias, illustrate how to apply the bound for other types of selection bias, and provide a program for directly calculating M-bias and the bound. Methods: We derive a bound for selection bias assuming specific, causal relationships that characterize M-bias and further evaluate it using simulations. Results: Through examples, we show that, in many plausible situations, M-bias will tend to be small. In some examples, the bias is not small-but plausibility of the examples, ultimately to be judged by the researcher, may be low. The examples also show how the M-bias bound yields bounds for other types of selection bias and also for confounding. The latter illustrates how Lee's bound for confounding can arise as a limiting case of ours. Conclusions: We have derived a new bound for M-bias. Examples illustrate how to apply it with other types of selection bias. They also show that it can yield tighter bounds in certain situations than a previously published bound for M-bias. Our examples suggest that M-bias may often, but not uniformly, be small.	[Flanders, W.

EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						selection bias; confounding; magnetic fields; wire codes; childhood leukemia; case-control studies	ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC-LEUKEMIA; CHILDHOOD-CANCER; WIRE CODES; EXPOSURE; NONRESPONDENTS; RESPONDENTS; ASSOCIATION	In contrast with several previous studies, our recent large case-control study found little association between childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and electric-power-line wire codes. Here we examine internal evidence from our study to assess the possibility that selection bias and/or confounding may have affected the findings. We compared the relation between childhood ALL and wire codes and direct measurements of magnetic fields in subjects who participated in all phases of the study with the relation in all subjects, including those who declined to allow access inside the home. We found that the odds ratio for ALL among those living in homes with very high current configurations increased by 23% when 107 "partial participants" were excluded. We found similar, but slightly smaller, increases in the odds ratios when we performed the same comparisons using direct measurements of magnetic fields, excluding subjects who allowed only a measurement outside the front door. "Partial participants" tended to be characterized by lower socioeconomic status than subjects who participated fully, suggesting possible selection bias. We also examined the relation between a large number of potential confounding variables and both proxy and direct measurements of magnetic fields. Univariate adjustment for individual variables changed the odds ratio for ALL by less than 8%, while simultaneous adjustment for several factors reduced the estimate by a maximum of 15%. We conclude that while confounding alone is unlikely to be an important source of bias in our own and previous studies of magnetic fields, selection bias may be more of a concern, particularly in light of the generally low response rates among controls in case-control studies.

J	Zhu, J; Gallego, B				Zhu, Jie; Gallego, Blanca			Causal inference for observational longitudinal studies using deep survival models	JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Survival Analysis; Causal Inference; Deep Learning; Neural Subnetworks	SEPSIS	Objective: Causal inference for observational longitudinal studies often requires the accurate estimation of treatment effects on time-to-event outcomes in the presence of time-dependent patient history and time -dependent covariates. Materials and Methods: To tackle this longitudinal treatment effect estimation problem, we have developed a time-variant causal survival (TCS) model that uses the potential outcomes framework with an ensemble of recurrent subnetworks to estimate the difference in survival probabilities and its confidence interval over time as a function of time-dependent covariates and treatments. Results: Using simulated survival datasets, the TCS model showed good causal effect estimation performance across scenarios of varying sample dimensions, event rates, confounding and overlapping. However, increasing the sample size was not effective in alleviating the adverse impact of a high level of confounding. In a large clinical cohort study, TCS identified the expected conditional average treatment effect and detected individual treatment effect heterogeneity over time. TCS provides an efficient way to estimate and update individualized treatment effects over time, in order to improve clinical decisions. Discussion: The use of a propensity score layer and potential outcome subnetworks helps correcting for selection bias. However, the proposed model is limited in its ability to correct the bias from unmeasured confounding, and more extensive testing of TCS under extreme scenarios such as low overlapping and the presence of unmeasured confounders is desired and left for future work. Conclusion: TCS fills the gap in causal inference using deep learning techniques in survival analysis. It considers time-varying confounders and treatment options. Its treatment effect estimation can be easily compared with the conventional literature, which uses relative measures of treatment effect. We expect TCS will be particularly useful for identifying and quantifying treatment effect heterogeneity over time under the ever complex obser-vational health care environment.

The first school is linked to path analysis and structural equation models (SEMs), while the second is related mostly to methods developed within the potential outcomes approach to causal inference. By giving model-free definitions of direct and indirect effects and clear assumptions for their identification, the latter school has formalized notions intuitively developed in the former and has greatly increased the flexibility of the models involved. However, through its predominant focus on nonparametric identification, the causal inference approach to effect decomposition via natural effects is limited to settings that exclude intermediate confounders. Such confounders are naturally dealt with (albeit with the caveats of informality and modeling inflexibility) in the SEM framework. Therefore, it seems pertinent to revisit SEMs with intermediate confounders, armed with the formal definitions and (parametric) identification assumptions from causal inference. Here we investigate: 1) how identification assumptions affect the specification of SEMs, 2) whether the more restrictive SEM assumptions can be relaxed, and 3) whether existing sensitivity analyses can be extended to this setting. Data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (1990-2005) are used for illustration.

Comparison of Instrumental Variable Analysis Using a New Instrument With Risk Adjustment Methods to Reduce Confounding by Indication	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						asthma; comparative effectiveness research; confounding factors (epidemiology); instrumental variable; propensity score; risk adjustment; therapeutics	PROPENSITY SCORE; PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT; BREAST-CANCER; ASTHMA; HETEROGENEITY; IDENTIFICATION; SELECTION; DATABASE; THERAPY; BIAS	Confounding by indication is a vexing problem, especially in evaluating treatment effects using observational data, since treatment decisions are often related to disease severity, prognosis, and frailty. To compare the ability of the instrumental variable (IV) approach with a new instrument based on the local-area practice style and risk adjustment methods, including conventional multivariate regression and propensity score adjustment, to reduce confounding by indication, the authors investigated the effects of long-term control (LTC) therapy on the occurrence of acute asthma exacerbation events among children and young adults with incident and uncontrolled persistent asthma, using Iowa Medicaid claims files from 1997-1999. Established evidence from clinical trials has demonstrated the protective benefits of LTC therapy for persistent asthma. Among patients identified (n = 4,275), those with higher asthma severity at baseline were more likely to receive LTC therapy. The multivariate regression and propensity score adjustment methods suggested that LTC therapy had no effect on the occurrence of acute exacerbation events. Estimates from the new IV approach showed that LTC therapy significantly decreased the occurrence of acute exacerbation events, which is consistent with established clinical evidence. The authors discuss how to interpret estimates from the risk adjustment and IV methods when the treatment effect is heterogeneous.

J	Canan, C; Lesko, C; Lau, B				Canan, Chelsea; Lesko, Catherine; Lau, Bryan			Instrumental Variable Analyses and Selection Bias	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							INVERSE PROBABILITY; CAUSAL INFERENCE	Instrumental variables (IV) are used to draw causal conclusions about the effect of exposure E on outcome Y in the presence of unmeasured confounders. IV assumptions have been well described: (1) IV affects E; (2) IV affects Y only through E; (3) IV shares no common cause with Y. Even when these assumptions are met, biased effect estimates can result if selection bias allows a noncausal path from E to Y. We demonstrate the presence of bias in IV analyses on a sample from a simulated dataset, where selection into the sample was a collider on a noncausal path from E to Y. By applying inverse probability of selection weights, we were able to eliminate the selection bias. IV approaches may protect against unmeasured confounding but are not immune from selection bias. Inverse probability of selection weights used with IV approaches can minimize bias.

Directed acyclic graphs: An under-utilized tool for child maltreatment research	CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT			English	Article						Directed acyclic graphs; Causal diagrams; Confounding; Selection bias; Colliders; Methodology	CAUSAL INFERENCE; ADJUSTMENT; DIAGRAMS; SAMPLE; ABUSE; DAGS; BIAS	Background: Child maltreatment research involves modeling complex relationships between multiple interrelated variables. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are one tool child maltreatment researchers can use to think through relationships among the variables operative in a causal research question and to make decisions about the optimal analytic strategy to minimize potential sources of bias. Objective: The purpose of this paper is to highlight the utility of DAGs for child maltreatment research and to provide a practical resource to facilitate and support the use of DAGs in child maltreatment research. Results: We first provide an overview of DAG terminology and concepts relevant to child maltreatment research. We describe DAG construction and define specific types of variables within the context of DAGs including confounders, mediators, and colliders, detailing the manner in which each type of variable can be used to inform study design and analysis. We then describe four specific scenarios in which DAGs may yield valuable insights for child maltreatment research: (1) identifying covariates to include in multivariable models to adjust for confounding; (2) identifying unintended effects of adjusting for a mediator; (3) identifying unintended effects of adjusting for multiple types of maltreatment; and (4) identifying potential selection bias in data specific to children involved in the child welfare system. Conclusions: Overall, DAGs have the potential to help strengthen and advance the child maltreatment research and practice agenda by increasing transparency about assumptions, illuminating potential sources of bias, and enhancing the interpretability of results for translation to evidence-based practice.

J	Lindmark, A				Lindmark, Anita			Sensitivity analysis for unobserved confounding in causal mediation analysis allowing for effect modification, censoring and truncation	STATISTICAL METHODS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Causal inference; Indirect effect; Direct effect; Parametric estimation; Sequential ignorability; Uncertainty interval	BIAS FORMULAS; INFERENCE	Causal mediation analysis is used to decompose the total effect of an exposure on an outcome into an indirect effect, taking the path through an intermediate variable, and a direct effect. To estimate these effects, strong assumptions are made about unconfoundedness of the relationships between the exposure, mediator and outcome. These assumptions are difficult to verify in a given situation and therefore a mediation analysis should be complemented with a sensitivity analysis to assess the possible impact of violations. In this paper we present a method for sensitivity analysis to not only unobserved mediator-outcome confounding, which has largely been the focus of previous literature, but also unobserved confounding involving the exposure. The setting is estimation of natural direct and indirect effects based on parametric regression models. We present results for combinations of binary and continuous mediators and outcomes and extend the sensitivity analysis for mediator-outcome confounding to cases where the continuous outcome variable is censored or truncated. The proposed methods perform well also in the presence of interactions between the exposure, mediator and observed confounders, allowing for modeling flexibility as well as exploration of effect modification. The performance of the method is illustrated through simulations and an empirical example.

Here we are investigating the effects on treatment outcome of the number of sessions attended when the latter is possibly subject to hidden selection effects (hidden confounding). The aim is to estimate the parameters of a structural mean model (SMM) using randomisation, and possibly randomisation by covariate interactions, as instrumental variables. We describe, compare and illustrate the equivalence of the use of a simple G-estimation algorithm and two two-stage least squares procedures that are traditionally used in economics.

Directed acyclic graphs in statistical modelling of epidemiological studies	REVISTA MEDICA DE CHILE			Spanish	Article						Confounding Factors (Epidemiology); Epidemiologic Methods; Regression Analysis		Background: Confusion in observational epidemiological studies distorts the relationship between exposure and event. "Step by step" regression models, diverts the decision to a statistical algorithm with little causal basis. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), qualitatively and visually assess the confusion. They can complement the decision on confounder control during statistical modeling. Aim: To evaluate the minimum set of confounders to be controlled in a cause-effect relationship with the use of "step-by-step regression" and DAGs, in a study of arsenic exposure. Material and Methods: We worked with data from Caceres et al., 2010 in 66 individuals from northern Chile. The interindividual variability in the urinary excretion of dimethyl arsenic acid attributable to the GSTT1 polymorphism was estimated. A causal DAG was constructed using DAGitty v2.3 with the list of variables. A multiple linear regression model with the step-by-step backwards methodology was carried out. Results: The causal diagram included 12 non-causal open pathways. The minimum adjustment set corresponded to the variables "sex", "body mass index" and "fish and seafood ingest". Confusion retention of the multivariate model included normal and overweight status, gender and the interaction between "water intake" and GSTT1. Conclusions: The use of DAG prior to the modeling would allow a more comprehensive, coherent and biologically plausible analysis of causal relationships in public health.

However, it is not always possible to include all covariates in adjustment. We aimed to find the optimal imbalance threshold for entering covariates into regression. Methods: We conducted a series of Monte Carlo simulations on virtual populations of 5,000 subjects. We performed PS 1: 1 nearest-neighbor matching on each sample. We calculated standardized mean differences across groups to detect any remaining imbalance in the matched samples. We examined 25 thresholds (from 0.01 to 0.25, stepwise 0.01) for considering residual imbalance. The treatment effect was estimated using logistic regression that contained only those covariates considered to be unbalanced by these thresholds. Results: We showed that regression adjustment could dramatically remove residual confounding bias when it included all of the covariates with a standardized difference greater than 0.10. The additional benefit was negligible when we also adjusted for covariates with less imbalance. We found that the mean squared error of the estimates was minimized under the same conditions. Conclusion: If covariate balance is not achieved, we recommend reiterating PS modeling until standardized differences below 0.10 are achieved on most covariates. In case of remaining imbalance, a double adjustment might be worth considering.

J	Lee, PH; Burstyn, I				Lee, Paul H.; Burstyn, Igor			Identification of confounder in epidemiologic data contaminated by measurement error in covariates	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Causal effect; Change-in-estimate; Confounding; Simulation; Model-selection; Epidemiology	EXPOSURE-MEASUREMENT ERROR; SELECTION; CRITERION; VALIDITY; QUESTIONNAIRE; ADJUSTMENT; IMPACT	Background: Common methods for confounder identification such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), hypothesis testing, or a 10 % change-in-estimate (CIE) criterion for estimated associations may not be applicable due to (a) insufficient knowledge to draw a DAG and (b) when adjustment for a true confounder produces less than 10 % change in observed estimate (e.g. in presence of measurement error). Methods: We compare previously proposed simulation-based approach for confounder identification that can be tailored to each specific study and contrast it with commonly applied methods (significance criteria with cutoff levels of p-values of 0.05 or 0.20, and CIE criterion with a cutoff of 10 %), as well as newly proposed two-stage procedure aimed at reduction of false positives (specifically, risk factors that are not confounders). The new procedure first evaluates potential for confounding by examination of correlation of covariates and applies simulated CIE criteria only if there is evidence of correlation, while rejecting a covariate as confounder otherwise. These approaches are compared in simulations studies with binary, continuous, and survival outcomes. We illustrate the application of our proposed confounder identification strategy in examining the association of exposure to mercury in relation to depression in the presence of suspected confounding by fish intake using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009-2010 data. Results: Our simulations showed that the simulation-determined cutoff was very sensitive to measurement error in exposure and potential confounder. The analysis of NHANES data demonstrated that if the noise-to-signal ratio (error variance in confounder/variance of confounder) is at or below 0.5, roughly 80 % of the simulated analyses adjusting for fish consumption would correctly result in a null association of mercury and depression, and only an extremely poorly measured confounder is not useful to adjust for in this setting. Conclusions: No a prior criterion developed for a specific application is guaranteed to be suitable for confounder identification in general. The customization of model-building strategies and study designs through simulations that consider the likely imperfections in the data, as well as finite-sample behavior, would constitute an important improvement on some of the currently prevailing practices in confounder identification and evaluation.

Confounding Adjustment in Comparative Effectiveness Research Conducted Within Distributed Research Networks	MEDICAL CARE			English	Article						comparative effectiveness research; distributed research network; confounding; propensity score; disease risk score; instrumental variable; marginal structural model; pharmacoepidemiology	DISEASE RISK SCORES; PROPENSITY SCORE; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES; CAUSAL INFERENCE; SAFETY SURVEILLANCE; OUTCOMES RESEARCH; HEALTH; MORTALITY; SELECTION	Background: A distributed research network (DRN) of electronic health care databases, in which data reside behind the firewall of each data partner, can support a wide range of comparative effectiveness research (CER) activities. An essential component of a fully functional DRN is the capability to perform robust statistical analyses to produce valid, actionable evidence without compromising patient privacy, data security, or proprietary interests. Objectives and Methods: We describe the strengths and limitations of different confounding adjustment approaches that can be considered in observational CER studies conducted within DRNs, and the theoretical and practical issues to consider when selecting among them in various study settings. Results: Several methods can be used to adjust for multiple confounders simultaneously, either as individual covariates or as confounder summary scores (eg, propensity scores and disease risk scores), including: (1) centralized analysis of patient-level data, (2) case-centered logistic regression of risk set data, (3) stratified or matched analysis of aggregated data, (4) distributed regression analysis, and (5) meta-analysis of site-specific effect estimates. These methods require different granularities of information be shared across sites and afford investigators different levels of analytic flexibility. Conclusions: DRNs are growing in use and sharing of highly detailed patient-level information is not always feasible in DRNs. Methods that incorporate confounder summary scores allow investigators to adjust for a large number of confounding factors without the need to transfer potentially identifiable information in DRNs. They have the potential to let investigators perform many analyses traditionally conducted through a centralized dataset with detailed patient-level information.

First, convincing evidence has to be established that there is a risk at all. In practice this endeavor requires prudent use of the observational epidemiological information with delicate balancing between utilizing the information optimally but not over-interpreting it. If a case for an environmental risk has been made, the second challenge is to provide useful input that regulatory authorities can use to set standards. This article surveys some of these issues in the concrete case of neurobehavioral effects in Faroese children prenatally exposed to methylmercury. A selection of modem, appropriate methods has been applied in the analysis of this material that may be considered typical of environmental epidemiology today.

Instrumental variable methods for causal inference	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						instrumental variables; observational study; confounding; comparative effectiveness	MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION; MATERNAL SMOKING; PROPENSITY SCORE; CLINICAL-TRIAL; UNITED-STATES; TO-TREAT; MODELS; HEALTH; IDENTIFICATION; REGRESSION	A goal of many health studies is to determine the causal effect of a treatment or intervention on health outcomes. Often, it is not ethically or practically possible to conduct a perfectly randomized experiment, and instead, an observational study must be used. A major challenge to the validity of observational studies is the possibility of unmeasured confounding (i.e., unmeasured ways in which the treatment and control groups differ before treatment administration, which also affect the outcome). Instrumental variables analysis is a method for controlling for unmeasured confounding. This type of analysis requires the measurement of a valid instrumental variable, which is a variable that (i) is independent of the unmeasured confounding; (ii) affects the treatment; and (iii) affects the outcome only indirectly through its effect on the treatment. This tutorial discusses the types of causal effects that can be estimated by instrumental variables analysis; the assumptions needed for instrumental variables analysis to provide valid estimates of causal effects and sensitivity analysis for those assumptions; methods of estimation of causal effects using instrumental variables; and sources of instrumental variables in health studies.

Using Super Learner Prediction Modeling to Improve High-dimensional Propensity Score Estimation	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD-ESTIMATION; VARIABLE SELECTION; CONFOUNDING ADJUSTMENT; REGRESSION; BALANCE; COHORT; BIAS	The high-dimensional propensity score is a semiautomated variable selection algorithm that can supplement expert knowledge to improve confounding control in nonexperimental medical studies utilizing electronic healthcare databases. Although the algorithm can be used to generate hundreds of patient-level variables and rank them by their potential confounding impact, it remains unclear how to select the optimal number of variables for adjustment. We used plasmode simulations based on empirical data to discuss and evaluate data-adaptive approaches for variable selection and prediction modeling that can be combined with the high-dimensional propensity score to improve confounding control in large healthcare databases. We considered approaches that combine the high-dimensional propensity score with Super Learner prediction modeling, a scalable version of collaborative targeted maximum-likelihood estimation, and penalized regression. We evaluated performance using bias and mean squared error (MSE) in effect estimates. Results showed that the high-dimensional propensity score can be sensitive to the number of variables included for adjustment and that severe overfitting of the propensity score model can negatively impact the properties of effect estimates. Combining the high-dimensional propensity score with Super Learner was the most consistent strategy, in terms of reducing bias and MSE in the effect estimates, and may be promising for semiautomated data-adaptive propensity score estimation in high-dimensional covariate datasets.

In addition, more complex questions of interest, such as effects of treatment on the treated and mediated effects may not always be identified even in data where treatment assignment is known and under investigator control, or may be identified under one causal model but not another. Increasingly complex effects of interest, coupled with a diversity of causal models in use resulted in a fragmented view of identification. This fragmentation makes it unnecessarily difficult to determine if a given parameter is identified (and in what model), and what assumptions must hold for this to be the case. This, in turn, complicates the development of estimation theory and sensitivity analysis procedures. In this paper, we give a unifying view of a large class of causal effects of interest, including novel effects not previously considered, in terms of a hierarchy of interventions, and show that identification theory for this large class reduces to an identification theory of random variables under interventions from this hierarchy. Moreover, we show that one type of intervention in the hierarchy is naturally associated with queries identified under the Finest Fully Randomized Causally Interpretable Structure Tree Graph (FFRCISTG) model of Robins (via the extended g-formula), and another is naturally associated with queries identified under the Non-Parametric Structural Equation Model with Independent Errors (NPSEM-IE) of Pearl, via a more general functional we call the edge g-formula. Our results motivate the study of estimation theory for the edge g-formula, since we show it arises both in mediation analysis, and in settings where treatment assignment has unobserved causes, such as models associated with Pearl's front-door criterion.

However, few generalizability approaches exist for estimating causal quantities in a target population that is not well-represented by a randomized study but is reflected when additionally incorporating observational data. To generalize to a target population represented by a union of these data, we propose a novel class of conditional cross-design synthesis estimators that combine randomized and observational data, while addressing their estimates' respective biases-lack of overlap and unmeasured confounding. These methods enable estimating the causal effect of managed care plans on health care spending among Medicaid beneficiaries in New York City, which requires obtaining estimates for the 7% of beneficiaries randomized to a plan and 93% who choose a plan, who do not resemble randomized beneficiaries. Our new estimators include outcome regression, propensity weighting, and double robust approaches. All use the covariate overlap between the randomized and observational data to remove potential unmeasured confounding bias. Applying these methods, we find substantial heterogeneity in spending effects across managed care plans. This has major implications for our understanding of Medicaid, where this heterogeneity has previously been hidden. Additionally, we demonstrate that unmeasured confounding rather than lack of overlap poses a larger concern in this setting.

Alternatives to randomisation in the evaluation of public-health interventions: statistical analysis and causal inference	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article							PROPENSITY SCORE METHODS; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; BASE-LINE; TIME; VACCINE; EVENTS; NUMBER	Background In non-randomised evaluations of public-health interventions, statistical methods to control confounding will usually be required. We review approaches to the control of confounding and discuss issues in drawing causal inference from these studies. Methods Non-systematic review of literature and mathematical data-simulation. Results Standard stratification and regression techniques will often be appropriate, but propensity scores may be useful where many confounders need to be controlled, and data are limited. All these techniques require that key putative confounders are measured accurately. Instrumental variables offer, in theory, a solution to the problem of unknown or unmeasured confounders, but identifying an instrument which meets the required conditions will often be challenging. Obtaining measurements of the outcome variable in both intervention and control groups before the intervention is introduced allows balance to be assessed, and these data may be used to help control confounding. However, imbalance in outcome measures at baseline poses challenges for the analysis and interpretation of the evaluation, highlighting the value of adopting a design strategy that maximises the likelihood of achieving balance. Finally, when it is not possible to have any concurrent control group, making multiple measures of outcome pre- and postintervention can enable the estimation of intervention effects with appropriate statistical models. Conclusion For non-randomised designs, careful statistical analysis can help reduce bias by confounding in estimating intervention effects. However, investigators must report their methods thoroughly and be conscious and critical of the assumptions they must make whenever they adopt these designs.

Theory and Analysis of Total, Direct, and Indirect Causal Effects	MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH			English	Article							MEDIATION; INFERENCE; MODELS; IDENTIFICATION; EQUIVALENCE; BIAS	Mediation analysis, or more generally models with direct and indirect effects, are commonly used in the behavioral sciences. As we show in our illustrative example, traditional methods of mediation analysis that omit confounding variables can lead to systematically biased direct and indirect effects, even in the context of a randomized experiment. Therefore, several definitions of causal effects in mediation models have been presented in the literature (Baron & Kenny, 1986; Imai, Keele, & Tingley, 2010; Pearl, 2012). We illustrate the stochastic theory of causal effects as an alternative foundation of causal mediation analysis based on probability theory. In this theory we define total, direct, and indirect effects and show how they can be identified in the context of our illustrative example. A particular strength of the stochastic theory of causal effects are the causality conditions that imply causal unbiasedness of effect estimates. The causality conditions have empirically testable implications and can be used for covariate selection. In the discussion, we highlight some similarities and differences of the stochastic theory of causal effects with other theories of causal effects.

Considerations and Targeted Approaches to Identifying Bad Actors in Exposure Mixtures	STATISTICS IN BIOSCIENCES			English	Article; Early Access						Mixtures; Causal inference; Variable importance; Persistent organic pollutants	CAUSAL INFERENCE; TELOMERE LENGTH; REGRESSION; SELECTION	Variable importance is a key statistical issue in exposure mixtures, as it allows a ranking of exposures as potential targets for intervention, and helps to identify bad actors within a mixture. In settings where mixtures have many constituents or high between-constituent correlations, estimators of importance can be subject to bias or high variance. Current approaches to assessing variable importance have major limitations, including reliance on overly strong or incorrect constraints or assumptions, excessive model extrapolation, or poor interpretability, especially regarding practical significance. We sought to overcome these limitations by applying an established doubly robust, machine learning-based approach to estimating variable importance in a mixtures context. This method reduces model extrapolation, appropriately controls confounding, and provides both interpretability and model flexibility. We illustrate its use with an evaluation of the relationship between telomere length, a measure of biologic aging, and exposure to a mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxins, and furans among 979 US adults from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). In contrast with standard approaches for mixtures, our approach selected PCB 180 and PCB 194 as important contributors to telomere length. We hypothesize that this difference could be due to residual confounding in standard methods that rely on variable selection. Further empirical evaluation of this method is needed, but it is a promising tool in the search for bad actors within a mixture.

Time-Dependent Confounding in the Study of the Effects of Regular Physical Activity in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: An Application of the Marginal Structural Model	ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Confounding Factors (Epidemiology); Epidemiology; Epidemiologic Methods; Exercise; Models; Statistical; Motor Activity; Pulmonary Disease; Chronic Obstructive	BODY-COMPOSITION; RISK; MORTALITY; LIMITATION; SURVIVAL; DECLINE; DEATH; COPD	PURPOSE: Results from longitudinal studies about the association between physical activity and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may have been biased because they did not properly adjust for time-dependent confounders. Marginal structural models (MSMs) have been proposed to address this type of confounding. We sought to assess the presence of time-dependent confounding in the association between physical activity and COPD development and course by comparing risk estimates between standard statistical methods and MSMs. METHODS: By using the population-based cohort Copenhagen City Heart Study, 6,568 subjects selected from the general population in 1976 were followed up until 2004 with three repeated examinations. RESULTS: Moderate to high compared with low physical activity was associated with a reduced risk of developing COPD both in the standard analysis (odds ratio [OR] 0.76, p = 0.007) and in the MSM analysis (OR 0.79, p = 0.025). In the subgroup with COPD (n = 2,226), high physical activity was associated with a reduced risk of COPD admissions during follow-up (standard, incidence rate ratio, 0.74; p = 0.096; MSM, 0.68, p = 0.044), and with a reduced risk of mortality (standard, hazard ratio 0.80, p = 0.001; MSM, 0.81, p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: These results support the previously reported associations between physical activity and reduced risk of COPD development, hospitalizations, and mortality, thereby suggesting they were not due to time-dependent confounding.

These methods have so far been compared under circumstances where intake of the nutrient of interest is measured as a continuous variable. Because it is common practice to categorize nutrient intakes in the analysis, the authors investigate the effect of such categorization on the interpretation of results from the four methods with the use of computer simulations and statistical theory. They consider four cases: where the nutrient intake is either divided into quartiles or ordered so as to investigate trend over the quartile groups, combined with using an adjusting variable that is either continuous or categorized. The results show: 1) the Residual, Standard, and Partition methods are no longer equivalent as they are in the continuous case; 2) compared with the Standard method, the Residual method appears to be more powerful for detecting trends in relative odds, is more robust to residual confounding when the adjustment Variable is categorized, and provides more meaningful odds ratios; and 3) the Residual and Nutrient Density methods give closely similar results.

Discovering causal associations between variables is one of the main goals of clinical trials, with the ultimate aim of identifying the causes of specific health status. Prior knowledge of causal paths could help ensure patients do not develop the resultant conditions. In recent years, thanks to the enormous amount of health data stored with the support of digital tools, attempts have been made to employ Machine Learning to infer causality. Those methodologies suffer from some deficiencies in controlling cofounders when analysing causality, as well as providing causal rules general enough to be useful in healthcare practice. Conversely, this work presents and evaluates CauRuler, a new approach to deal with causality from association rules. The proposed approach uses a pruning strategy to reduce the association rule set, which does not compromise the causality learning capability of the algorithm. This behaviour makes the algorithm suitable for exploiting large health databases with thousands of patients and medical instances. CauRuler can control a larger number of confounders than other proposals, bringing robustness to causal analysis and avoiding the identification of spurious associations. Additionally, the method generalizes causality using anti-monotone properties to obtain complex and general causal paths. The method can target correct causal associations in complex medical databases with retrospective data. Method: CauRuler extends association rule mining with an irredundancy property so that the set of rules learnt is reduced in size and generalized. General association rules, conformed by fewer items, enable controlling more confounding variables to verify, with more statistical evidence on available data, if they represent causal paths in patient disease trajectories.Results: CauRuler has been tested on a complex real medical database (3,5 M visits to the primary care services between 2019 and 2020, and controlling over 15.000 different variables including diagnoses and demographic and other clinical patient data). The reduction of the rule set achieved by the pruning strategy goes from 7.732 to 2.240 rules, from which 46 have been found to have causality relationships in the patient trajectories, and generalized to 14 rules tested as true causal relationships thanks to the confounding analysis. These rules have been validated by clinicians with the support of a graphical map. The obtained causal paths control in average of 906 confounder variables, retrieving robust results.Conclusions: Causal relationships enable predicting causal paths between health conditions according to patient trajectories. Knowing these causal paths is crucial for understanding and preventing the appearance or worsening of diseases in patients. CauRuler, with high demanding thresholds, has proven its efficiency and effectiveness in targeting previously known causal associations between diagnoses, reaching consensus in the medical community. Softening these thresholds should help target interesting general causal paths.

Addressing missing data in confounders when estimating propensity scores for continuous exposures	HEALTH SERVICES AND OUTCOMES RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Generalized propensity scores; Missing data; Causal inference; Continuous exposures	MULTIPLE IMPUTATION; CAUSAL INFERENCE	Propensity score models are frequently used to estimate causal effects in observational studies. One unresolved issue in fitting these models is handling missing values in the propensity score model covariates. As these models usually contain a large set of covariates, using only individuals with complete data significantly decreases the sample size and statistical power. Several missing data imputation approaches have been proposed, including multiple imputation (MI), MI with missingness pattern (MIMP), and treatment mean imputation. Generalized boosted modeling (GBM), which is a nonparametric approach to estimate propensity scores, can automatically handle missingness in the covariates. Although the performance of MI, MIMP, and treatment mean imputation have previously been compared for binary treatments, they have not been compared for continuous exposures or with single imputation and GBM. We compared these approaches in estimating the generalized propensity score (GPS) for a continuous exposure in both a simulation study and in empirical data. Using GBM with the incomplete data to estimate the GPS did not perform well in the simulation. Missing values should be imputed before estimating propensity scores using GBM or any other approach for estimating the GPS.

J	Caron, A; Baio, G; Manolopoulou, I				Caron, Alberto; Baio, Gianluca; Manolopoulou, Ioanna			Shrinkage Bayesian Causal Forests for Heterogeneous Treatment Effects Estimation	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND GRAPHICAL STATISTICS			English	Article						Bayesian nonparametrics; Causal inference; Heterogeneous treatment effects; Observational studies; Machine learning; Tree ensembles	LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; EARLY INTERVENTION; PROPENSITY SCORE; PREMATURE-INFANTS; REGRESSION; INFERENCE; SELECTION; HEALTH	This article develops a sparsity-inducing version of Bayesian Causal Forests, a recently proposed nonparametric causal regression model that employs Bayesian Additive Regression Trees and is specifically designed to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects using observational data. The sparsity-inducing component we introduce is motivated by empirical studies where not all the available covariates are relevant, leading to different degrees of sparsity underlying the surfaces of interest in the estimation of individual treatment effects. The extended version presented in this work, which we name Shrinkage Bayesian Causal Forest, is equipped with an additional pair of priors allowing the model to adjust the weight of each covariate through the corresponding number of splits in the tree ensemble. These priors improve the model's adaptability to sparse data generating processes and allow to perform fully Bayesian feature shrinkage in a framework for treatment effects estimation, and thus to uncover the moderating factors driving heterogeneity. In addition, the method allows prior knowledge about the relevant confounding covariates and the relative magnitude of their impact on the outcome to be incorporated in the model. We illustrate the performance of our method in simulated studies, in comparison to Bayesian Causal Forest and other state-of-the-art models, to demonstrate how it scales up with an increasing number of covariates and how it handles strongly confounded scenarios. Finally, we also provide an example of application using real-world data. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.

We demonstrate the use of multiple PS estimation methods to optimize covariate balance. Methods: We used secondary data from 1292 adults with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression trial (2001-2004). After initial citalopram treatment failed, patient preference influenced assignment to medication augmentation (n = 565) or switch (n = 727). To reduce selection bias, we used boosted classification and regression trees (BCART) and logistic regression iteratively to identify two potentially optimal PSs. We assessed and compared covariate balance. Results: After iterative selection of interaction terms to minimize imbalance, logistic regression yielded better balance than BCART (average standardized absolute mean difference across 47 covariates: 0.03 vs. 0.08, matching; 0.02 vs. 0.05, weighting). Conclusions: Comparing multiple PS estimates is a pragmatic way to optimize balance. Logistic regression remains valuable for this purpose. Simulation studies are needed to compare PS models under varying conditions. Such studies should consider more flexible estimation methods, such as logistic models with automated selection of interactions or hybrid models using main effects logistic regression instead of a constant log-odds as the initial model for BCART.

Many published time series papers have used parameter-heavy models that fully explained the second order patterns in disease to give residuals that have no short-term autocorrelation or seasonality. This is often achieved by including predictors of past disease counts (autoregression) or seasonal splines with many degrees of freedom. These approaches give great residuals, but add little to our understanding of cause and effect. We argue that modelling approaches should rely more on good epidemiology and less on statistical tests. This includes thinking about causal pathways, making potential confounders explicit, fitting a limited number of models, and not over-fitting at the cost of under-estimating the true association between exposure and disease.

J	Petersen, AH; Lange, T				Petersen, Anne Helby; Lange, Theis			What Is the Causal Interpretation of Sibling Comparison Designs?	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Causal inference; Confounding; Counterfactual; Observational data; Sibling comparison designs	BIRTH-WEIGHT; RISK; CONFOUNDERS; CHILDHOOD; DELIVERY; DISORDER; AUTISM; COHORT; AGE	Sibling comparison designs have long been used to assess causal effects of exposures for which randomized studies are impossible and measurement of all relevant confounding is unobtainable. The idea is to utilize the fact that siblings often share a lot of unobserved variables. Therefore, it is proposed that in certain cases, comparing siblings is equivalent to comparing exchangeable individuals, which is the foundation for causal inference based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, this intuition-and the publication of highly important sibling studies-vastly predate modern causal inference theory. Full causal descriptions of sibling comparison designs are essentially nonexistent, and therefore it is not clear exactly how or if we can interpret their estimated effects as causal. We fill this theoretical gap by proposing a counterfactual-based framework for sibling comparison designs. Moreover, we employ this framework to derive precise causal interpretations for three commonly used sibling model estimators stemming from fixed-effects ordinary least squares (OLS), conditional logistic regression, and stratified Cox regression. We establish that, for the latter two, the obtained effect parameter describes a causal effect on the full sibling group, not the individuals, and thus it does not correspond to the prevailing intuition from the RCT analogue. For fixed-effects OLS estimation, the parameter describes a causal effect on an individual, but may depend on an intervention on the whole sibling group. OLS estimation thus results in an estimator that can be given a simple causal interpretation that is similar, but not equal to, the RCT parallel. See video abstract at, .

Clarifying the causes of consistent and inconsistent findings in genetics	GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Review						confounding; selection bias; causal inference; GWAS; heritability; consistency; replications	SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; SELECTION BIAS; POPULATION STRATIFICATION; GENOME; INFERENCE; HEALTH; HYPERSENSITIVITY; HERITABILITY; PATTERNS	As research in genetics has advanced, some findings have been unexpected or shown to be inconsistent between studies or datasets. The reasons these inconsistencies arise are complex. Results from genetic studies can be affected by various factors including statistical power, linkage disequilibrium, quality control, confounding and selection bias, as well as real differences from interactions and effect modifiers, which may be informative about the mechanisms of traits and disease. Statistical artefacts can manifest as differences between results but they can also conceal underlying differences, which implies that their critical examination is important for understanding the underpinnings of traits. In this review, we examine these factors and outline how they can be identified and conceptualised with structural causal models. We explain the consequences they have on genetic estimates, such as genetic associations, polygenic scores, family- and genome-wide heritability, and describe methods to address them to aid in the estimation of true effects of genetic variation. Clarifying these factors can help researchers anticipate when results are likely to diverge and aid researchers' understanding of causal relationships between genes and complex traits.

In general, individuals who receive the highest level of treatment are the individuals with the greatest severity and need for treatment. Thus, there is planned selection of the treatment dose. In addition to the planned selection mandated by the treatment rules, staff judgment results in unplanned selection of the treatment level. Given observational longitudinal data or data in which there is unplanned selection of the treatment level, the methodology proposed here allows the estimation of a mean response to a dynamic treatment regime under the assumption of sequential randomization.

Using aggregated time series data, ITSA evaluates whether the time trend of a health indicator shows a change associated with the radiological event. That is, ITSA checks whether there is a statistically significant discrepancy between the projection of a pre-event trend and the data empirically observed after the event. Conducting ITSA requires one to consider specific methodological issues due to unique threats to internal validity that make ITSA prone to bias. We here discuss the strengths and limitations of ITSA with respect to bias and confounding, data quality, and statistical aspects. We provide recommendations to strengthen the robustness of ITSA studies and reduce their susceptibility to producing spurious results as a consequence of arbitrary modelling decisions.

Tchetgen			On semiparametric estimation of a path-specific effect in the presence of mediator-outcome confounding	BIOMETRIKA			English	Article						Causal inference; HIV/AIDS; Machine learning; Mediation; Multiple robustness; Unobserved confounding	CAUSAL; INFERENCE; MODELS	Path-specific effects constitute a broad class of mediated effects from an exposure to an outcome via one or more causal pathways along a set of intermediate variables. Most of the literature concerning estimation of mediated effects has focused on parametric models, with stringent assumptions regarding unmeasured confounding. We consider semiparametric inference of a path-specific effect when these assumptions are relaxed. In particular, we develop a suite of semiparametric estimators for the effect along a pathway through a mediator, but not through an exposure-induced confounder of that mediator. These estimators have different robustness properties, as each depends on different parts of the likelihood of the observed data. One estimator is locally semiparametric efficient and multiply robust. The latter property implies that machine learning can be used to estimate nuisance functions. We demonstrate these properties, as well as finite-sample properties of all the estimators, in a simulation study. We apply our method to an HIV study, in which we estimate the effect comparing two drug treatments on a patient's average log CD4 count mediated by the patient's level of adherence, but not by previous experience of toxicity, which is clearly affected by which treatment the patient is assigned to and may confound the effect of the patient's level of adherence on their virologic outcome.

A two-part model is a popular choice for analyzing medical cost data, where the first part models the probability of a positive cost using logistic regression and the second part models the positive cost using a lognormal or Gamma distribution. To address the unmeasured confounding in studies on cost outcome under two-part models, two instrumental variable (IV) methods, two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI) and two-stage prediction substitution (2SPS) are widely applied. However, previous literature demonstrated that both the 2SRI and the 2SPS could fail to consistently estimate the causal effect among compliers under standard IV assumptions for binary and survival outcomes. Our simulation studies confirmed that it continued to be the case for a two-part model, which is another nonlinear model. In this article, we develop a model-based IV approach, Instrumental Variable with Two-Part model (IV2P), to obtain a consistent estimate of the causal effect among compliers for cost outcome under standard IV assumptions. In addition, we develop sensitivity analysis approaches to allow the evaluation of the sensitivity of the causal conclusions to potential quantified violations of the exclusion restriction assumption and the randomization of IV assumption. We apply our method to a randomized cash incentive study to evaluate the effect of a primary care visit on medical cost among low-income adults newly covered by a primary care program.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS FOR UNMEASURED CONFOUNDING IN COARSE STRUCTURAL NESTED MEAN MODELS	STATISTICA SINICA			English	Article						Censoring; confounding by indication; estimating equations; HIV/AIDS research; non-ignorable; sequential randomization	MISSING DATA; NONCOMPLIANCE; MORTALITY; INFECTION; INFERENCE; THERAPY; IMPACT; TRIALS; TIME; BIAS	Coarse Structural Nested Mean Models (SNMMs, Robins (2000)) and G-estimation can be used to estimate the causal effect of a time-varying treatment from longitudinal observational studies. However, they rely on an untestable assumption of no unmeasured confounding. In the presence of unmeasured confounders, the unobserved potential outcomes are not missing at random, and standard G-estimation leads to biased effect estimates. To remedy this, we investigate the sensitivity of G-estimators of coarse SNMMs to unmeasured confounding, assuming a nonidentifiable bias function which quantifies the impact of unmeasured confounding on the average potential outcome. We present adjusted G-estimators of coarse SNMM parameters and prove their consistency, under the bias modeling for unmeasured confounding. We present a sensitivity analysis for the effect of the ART initiation time on the mean CD4 count at year 2 after infection in HIV-positive patients, based on the prospective Acute and Early Disease Research Program.

Common Methods for Handling Missing Data in Marginal Structural Models: What Works and Why	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						complete cases; inverse probability weighting; last observation carried forward; missingness pattern approach; multiple imputation; propensity score; time-varying confounding	INVERSE PROBABILITY WEIGHTS; MULTIPLE IMPUTATION; VALUES	Marginal structural models (MSMs) are commonly used to estimate causal intervention effects in longitudinal nonrandomized studies. A common challenge when using MSMs to analyze observational studies is incomplete confounder data, where a poorly informed analysis method will lead to biased estimates of intervention effects. Despite a number of approaches described in the literature for handling missing data in MSMs, there is little guidance on what works in practice and why. We reviewed existing missing-data methods for MSMs and discussed the plausibility of their underlying assumptions. We also performed realistic simulations to quantify the bias of 5 methods used in practice: complete-case analysis, last observation carried forward, the missingness pattern approach, multiple imputation, and inverse-probability-of-missingness weighting. We considered 3 mechanisms for nonmonotone missing data encountered in research based on electronic health record data. Further illustration of the strengths and limitations of these analysis methods is provided through an application using a cohort of persons with sleep apnea: the research database of the French Observatoire Sommeil de la Federation de Pneumologie. We recommend careful consideration of 1) the reasons for missingness, 2) whether missingness modifies the existing relationships among observed data, and 3) the scientific context and data source, to inform the choice of the appropriate method(s) for handling partially observed confounders in MSMs.	[Leyrat, Clemence; Carpenter, James R.; Williamson, Elizabeth J.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Med Stat, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England; [Carpenter, James R.] UCL, MRC, London Hub Trials Methodol Res, Clin Trials Unit, London, England; [Bailly, Sebastien] Univ Grenoble Alpes, Unite 1042, INSERM, Lab Hypoxie Physiopathol, Grenoble, France; [Williamson, Elizabeth J.] Hlth Data Res, London, England	University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of London; University College London; Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit; Communaute Universite Grenoble Alpes; Universite Grenoble Alpes (UGA); Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm)	Leyrat, C (corresponding author), London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Med Stat, Keppel St, London WC1E 7HT, England.	clemence.leyrat@Ishtm.ac.uk	Leyrat, Clémence/I-9413-2019; zheng, liu/KHU-2329-2024; BAILLY, Sebastien/H-4648-2013	Leyrat, Clémence/0000-0002-4097-4577; BAILLY, Sebastien/0000-0002-2179-4650; Carpenter, James/0000-0003-3890-6206	Medical Research Council [MR/M013278/1, MC UU 12023/21, MC UU 12023/29]; "e-Health and Integrated Care" Chair of Excellence of the Universite Grenoble Alpes Foundation; Agence Nationale de la Recherche's Institut Interdisciplinaire d'Intelligence Artificielle MIAI@Grenoble Alpes project (Multidisciplinary Institute of Artificial Intelligence); MRC [MR/S01442X/1, MC_UU_12023/21, MR/M013278/1, MR/T032448/1] Funding Source: UKRI	Medical Research Council(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); "e-Health and Integrated Care" Chair of Excellence of the Universite Grenoble Alpes Foundation; Agence Nationale de la Recherche's Institut Interdisciplinaire d'Intelligence Artificielle MIAI@Grenoble Alpes project (Multidisciplinary Institute of Artificial Intelligence); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC))	This work was supported by the Medical Research Council (project grant MR/M013278/1 (E.J.W.) and grants MC UU 12023/21 (J.R.C.) and MC UU 12023/29 (J.R.C.)).

Objective: To determine the frequency and adequacy of adjustment for confounding in medical articles. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: 34 scientific medical journals with a high impact factor. Measurements: Frequency of reporting on methods used to adjust for confounding in 537 original research articles published in January 1998. Results: Of the 537 articles, 169 specified that adjustment for confounding was used. In 1 paper in 10, it was unclear which statistical method was used or for which variables adjustment was made. In 45% of papers, it was not clear how multicategory or continuous variables were treated in the analysis. inadequate reporting was less frequent if an author was affiliated with a department of statistics, epidemiology, or public health and if articles were published in journals with a high impact factor. Conclusions: Details of methods used to adjust for confounding are frequently not reported in original research articles.

J	Spiegelman, D; Zhou, X				Spiegelman, Donna; Zhou, Xin			Evaluating Public Health Interventions: 8. Causal Inference for Time-Invariant Interventions	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article							DOUBLY ROBUST ESTIMATION; PROPENSITY SCORE; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; MODELS	We provide an overview of classical and newer methods for the control of confounding of time-invariant interventions to permit causal inference in public health evaluations. We estimated the causal effect of gender on all-cause mortality in a large HIV care and treatment program supported by the President's Emergency Program for AIDS Relief in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, between 2004 and 2012. We compared results from multi-variable modeling, three propensity score methods, inverse-probability weighting, doubly robust methods, and targeted maximum likelihood estimation. Considerable confounding was evident, and, as expected by theory, all methods considered gave the same result, a statistically significant approximately 20% increased mortality rate in men. In general, there is no clear advantage of any of these methods for causal inference over classical multivariable modeling, from the point of view of either bias reduction or efficiency. Rather, given sufficient data to adequately fit the multivariable model to the data, multivariable modeling will yield causal estimates with the greatest statistical efficiency. All methods can adjust only for well-measured confounders-if there are unmeasured or poorly measured confounders, none of these methods will yield causal estimates.

Results from these models can be highly sensitive to inclusion of lagged and baseline exposure terms for different visits. This sensitivity is often overlooked in practice; moreover, results from these models are not directly comparable to results from conventional time-dependent regression models, because the latter do not estimate the same causal parameter even when no bias is present. We thus explore the implications of including lagged and baseline exposure terms in causal and regression models, using a public data set (Caerphilly Heart Disease Study in the United Kingdom, 1979-1998) relating smoking to cardiovascular outcomes.

Selecting a scale for spatial confounding adjustment	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY			English	Article						Air pollution epidemiology; Confounding; Regression splines; Spatial filtering	AIR-POLLUTION; TIME-SERIES; PARTICULATE MATTER; REGRESSION; MORTALITY; MODEL; BIAS; DIMENSION; EXPOSURE; HEALTH	Unmeasured, spatially structured factors can confound associations between spatial environmental exposures and health outcomes. Adding flexible splines to a regression model is a simple approach for spatial confounding adjustment, but the spline degrees of freedom do not provide an easily interpretable spatial scale. We describe a method for quantifying the extent of spatial confounding adjustment in terms of the Euclidean distance at which variation is removed. We develop this approach for confounding adjustment with splines and using Fourier and wavelet filtering. We demonstrate differences in the spatial scales that these bases can represent and provide a comparison of methods for selecting the amount of confounding adjustment. We find the best performance for selecting the amount of adjustment by using an information criterion evaluated on an outcome model without exposure. We apply this method to spatial adjustment in an analysis of fine particulate matter and blood pressure in a cohort of US women.

Inverse-probability-of-treatment weighted estimation of causal parameters in the presence of error-contaminated and time-dependent confounders	BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						causal inference; inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting; logistic regression model; marginal structural model; measurement error; time-dependent confounding	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; SIMULATION-EXTRAPOLATION; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; MULTIPLE-IMPUTATION; PROPENSITY SCORE; REGRESSION; BIAS; INFERENCE; MISCLASSIFICATION	Inverse-probability-of-treatment weighted (IPTW) estimation has been widely used to consistently estimate the causal parameters in marginal structural models, with time-dependent confounding effects adjusted for. Just like other causal inference methods, the validity of IPTW estimation typically requires the crucial condition that all variables are precisely measured. However, this condition, is often violated in practice due to various reasons. It has been well documented that ignoring measurement error often leads to biased inference results. In this paper, we consider the IPTW estimation of the causal parameters in marginal structural models in the presence of error-contaminated and time-dependent confounders. We explore several methods to correct for the effects of measurement error on the estimation of causal parameters. Numerical studies are reported to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed methods.

New methods are constantly being developed, and older more established methods are yet appropriate. Careful application of statistical analysis techniques can improve causal inference of comparative treatment effects from nonrandomized studies using secondary databases. A Task Force was formed to offer a review of the more recent developments in statistical control of confounding. Methods: The Task Force was commissioned and a chair was selected by the ISPOR Board of Directors in October 2007. This Report, the third in this issue of the journal, addressed methods to improve causal inference of treatment effects for nonrandomized studies. Results: The Task Force Report recommends general analytic techniques and specific best practices where consensus is reached including: use of stratification analysis before multivariable modeling, multivariable regression including model performance and diagnostic testing, propensity scoring, instrumental variable, and structural modeling techniques including marginal structural models, where appropriate for secondary data. Sensitivity analyses and discussion of extent of residual confounding are discussed. Conclusions: Valid findings of causal therapeutic benefits can be produced from nonrandomized studies using an array of state-of-the-art analytic techniques. Improving the quality and uniformity of these studies will improve the value to patients, physicians, and policymakers worldwide.

J	Infante-Rivard, C; Cusson, A				Infante-Rivard, Claire; Cusson, Alexandre			Reflection on modern methods: selection bias-a review of recent developments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Review						Selection bias; endogenous selection bias; causal inference; external validity; generalizability; sensitivity analysis	MISSING DATA; INFERENCE	Selection bias remains a more difficult bias to understand than confounding or measurement error. Past definitions have not always been illuminating and a simple method (such as the change-in-estimate method for confounding) has not been available to determine its presence and magnitude in the study sample. A better understanding of the nature of the bias has led to the definition of endogenous selection bias. It is the result of conditioning on a collider variable, itself caused by two other variables; the latter variables become spuriously associated. Conditioning on a variable in the analysis that is a collider or on an indicator of sample selection has the same effect. Note that selection bias is possible even in the absence of a collider, but in the presence of endogenous selection bias, the concern is whether it is possible to identify a causal effect in the sample. Conditions have been outlined to determine that. However, even if conditions are met to identify a causal effect in the study sample, its generalization to a defined target population is not a given. We discuss the concept of endogeneity and the sources of endogenous selection bias in observational studies. We then briefly address the terms generalizability, target population (or alternative formulations) and transportability. We outline the explicit conditions to identify causal effects in studies affected by selection bias: they involve exchangeability between exposed and unexposed and exchangeability between sampled and unsampled. We briefly describe methods to generalize estimated causal effects to the target population. The latter usually require data from the target population. Finally we discuss sensitivity analyses; some are limited to providing an indication of the presence and direction of the bias and others can provide corrected estimates with user-supplied selection bias parameters.

Propensity score methods for time-dependent cluster confounding	BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						clustering; matching; observational study; propensity score; survival analysis	CAUSAL INFERENCE; MODELS	In observational studies, subjects are often nested within clusters. In medical studies, patients are often treated by doctors and therefore patients are regarded as nested or clustered within doctors. A concern that arises with clustered data is that cluster-level characteristics (e.g., characteristics of the doctor) are associated with both treatment selection and patient outcomes, resulting in cluster-level confounding. Measuring and modeling cluster attributes can be difficult and statistical methods exist to control for all unmeasured cluster characteristics. An assumption of these methods however is that characteristics of the cluster and the effects of those characteristics on the outcome (as well as probability of treatment assignment when using covariate balancing methods) are constant over time. In this paper, we consider methods that relax this assumption and allow for estimation of treatment effects in the presence of unmeasured time-dependent cluster confounding. The methods are based on matching with the propensity score and incorporate unmeasured time-specific cluster effects by performing matching within clusters or using fixed- or random-cluster effects in the propensity score model. The methods are illustrated using data to compare the effectiveness of two total hip devices with respect to survival of the device and a simulation study is performed that compares the proposed methods. One method that was found to perform well is matching within surgeon clusters partitioned by time. Considerations in implementing the proposed methods are discussed.

Background: A randomized trial to prove that liver resection improves survival in patients with CRC-LM is neither feasible nor ethical. Here, we test this assertion using instrumental variable (IV) analysis that allows for causal-inference by controlling for observed and unobserved confounding effects. Methods: We abstracted data on patients with synchronous CRC-LM using the California Cancer Registry from 2000 to 2012 and linked the records to the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development Inpatient Database. We used 2 instruments: resection rates in a patient's neighborhood (within 50mile radius)-NALR rate; and Medical Service Study Area resection ratesMALR rate. IV analysis was performed using the 2SLS method. Results: A total of 24,828 patients were diagnosed with stage-IV colorectal cancer of which 16,382 (70%) had synchronous CRC-LM. Liver resection was performed in 1635 (9.8%) patients. NALR rates ranged from 8% (lowestquintile) to 11% (highest-quintile), whereas MALR rates ranged from 3% (lowest quintile) to 19% (highest quintile). There was a strong association between instruments and probability of liver resection (F-statistic at median cut-off: NALR 24.8; MALR 266.8; P < 0.001). IV analysis using both instruments revealed a 23.6 month gain in survival (robust SE 4.4, P < 0.001) with liver resection for patients whose treatment choices were influenced by the rates of resection in their geographic area (marginal patients), after accounting for measured and unmeasured confounders. Conclusion: Less than 10% of patients with CRC-LM had liver resection. Significant geographic variation in resection rates is attributable to community biases. Liver resection leads to extensive survival benefit, accounting for measured and unmeasured confounders.	[Raoof, Mustafa; Ituarte, Philip H.

Confounding and regression adjustment in difference-in-differences studies	HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						difference&#8208; in&#8208; differences; matching; parallel trends; regression adjustment; time&#8208; varying confounding	INTERACTION TERMS; MODELS	Objective To define confounding bias in difference-in-difference studies and compare regression- and matching-based estimators designed to correct bias due to observed confounders. Data sources We simulated data from linear models that incorporated different confounding relationships: time-invariant covariates with a time-varying effect on the outcome, time-varying covariates with a constant effect on the outcome, and time-varying covariates with a time-varying effect on the outcome. We considered a simple setting that is common in the applied literature: treatment is introduced at a single time point and there is no unobserved treatment effect heterogeneity. Study design We compared the bias and root mean squared error of treatment effect estimates from six model specifications, including simple linear regression models and matching techniques. Data collection Simulation code is provided for replication. Principal findings Confounders in difference-in-differences are covariates that change differently over time in the treated and comparison group or have a time-varying effect on the outcome. When such a confounding variable is measured, appropriately adjusting for this confounder (ie, including the confounder in a regression model that is consistent with the causal model) can provide unbiased estimates with optimal SE. However, when a time-varying confounder is affected by treatment, recovering an unbiased causal effect using difference-in-differences is difficult. Conclusions Confounding in difference-in-differences is more complicated than in cross-sectional settings, from which techniques and intuition to address observed confounding cannot be imported wholesale. Instead, analysts should begin by postulating a causal model that relates covariates, both time-varying and those with time-varying effects on the outcome, to treatment. This causal model will then guide the specification of an appropriate analytical model (eg, using regression or matching) that can produce unbiased treatment effect estimates. We emphasize the importance of thoughtful incorporation of covariates to address confounding bias in difference-in-difference studies.

Identifying and Addressing Confounding Bias in Violence Prevention Research	CURRENT EPIDEMIOLOGY REPORTS			English	Article						Confounding; Directed acyclic graphs; Violence prevention	FIREARM LEGISLATION; SUBSTANCE USE; RISK; GUN; PERPETRATION; ASSOCIATION; YOUTH; AMERICAN; HOMICIDE; SUICIDE	Purpose of ReviewViolence prevention research has enhanced our understanding of individual and community risk and protective factors for aggression and violence. However, our knowledge of risk and protective factors for violence is highly dependent on observational studies, since there are few randomized trials of risk and protective factors for violence. Observational studies are susceptible to systematic errors, specifically confounding, and may lack internal validity.Recent FindingsMany violence prevention studies utilize methods that do not correctly identify the set of covariates needed for statistical adjustment. This results in unwarranted matching and restriction leading to further confounding or selection bias. Covariate adjustment based on purely statistical criteria generates inconsistent results and uncertain conclusions.SummaryConventional methods used to identify confounding in violence prevention research are often inadequate. Causal diagrams have the potential to improve the understanding and identification of potential confounding biases in observational violence prevention studies, and methods like sensitivity analysis using quantitative bias analysis can help to address unmeasured confounding. Violence research studies should make more use of these methods.

Clinical mastitis (CM) is one of the most influential culling risk factors. However the culling decision could be based either on the disease status or on the current milk yield, milk production being a significant confounder when modelling dairy cow culling risk. But milk yield (and somatic cell count) are time-varying confounders, which are also affected by prior CM and therefore lie on the causal pathway between the exposure of interest, CM, and the outcome, culling. Including these time-varying confounders could result in biased estimates. A marginal structural model (MSM) is a statistical technique allowing estimation of the causal effect of a time-varying exposure in the presence of time-varying covariates without conditioning on these covariates. The objective of this paper is to estimate the causal effect on culling of CM occurring between calving and 120 days in milk, using MSM to control for such time-varying confounders affected by previous exposure. A retrospective longitudinal study was conducted on data from dairy herds in the Province of Quebec, Canada, by extracting health information events from the dairy herd health management software used by most Quebec dairy producers and their veterinarians. The data were extracted for all lactations starting between January 1st and December 31st, 2010. A total of 3952 heifers and 8724 cows from 261 herds met the inclusion criteria and were used in the analysis. The estimated CM causal hazard ratios were 1.96 [1.57-2.44] and 1.47 [1.28-1.69] for heifers and cows, respectively, and as long as causal assumptions hold. Our findings confirm that CM was a risk factor for culling,. but with a reduced effect compared to previous studies, which did not properly control for the presence of time dependent confounders such as milk yield and somatic cell count. Cows experienced a lower risk for CM, with milk production having more influence on culling risk in cows than heifers.

Investigation of the structure and magnitude of time-varying uncontrolled confounding in simulated cohort data analyzed using g-computation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Simulation; g-computation; time-varying; uncontrolled confounding; marginal structural model	CAUSAL INFERENCE; MODELS	Background When estimating the effect of time-varying exposures on longer-term outcomes, the assumption of conditional exchangeability or no uncontrolled confounding extends beyond baseline confounding to include time-varying confounding. We illustrate the structures and magnitude of uncontrolled time-varying confounding in exposure effect estimates obtained from g-computation when sequential conditional exchangeability is violated.Methods We used directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to depict time-varying uncontrolled confounding. We performed simulations and used g-computation to quantify the effects of each time-varying exposure for each DAG type. Models adjusting all time-varying confounders were considered the true (bias-adjusted) estimate. The exclusion of time-varying uncontrolled confounders represented the biased effect estimate and an unmet 'no uncontrolled confounding' assumption. True and biased estimates were compared across DAGs, with different magnitudes of uncontrolled confounding.Results Time-varying uncontrolled confounding can present in several scenarios, including relationships into subsequently measured exposure(s), outcome, unmeasured confounder(s) and other measured confounder(s). In simulations, effect estimates obtained from g-computation were more biased in DAGs when the uncontrolled confounders were directly related to the outcome. Complex DAGs that included relationships between uncontrolled confounders and other variables and relationships where exposures caused uncontrolled confounders at the next time point resulted in the most biased effect estimates. In these complex DAGs, excluding uncontrolled confounders affected the multiple effect estimates.Conclusions Time-varying uncontrolled confounding has the potential to substantially impact observed effect estimates. Given the importance of longitudinal studies in advising public health, the impact of time-varying uncontrolled confounding warrants more recognition and evaluation using quantitative bias analysis.

J	Mansournia, MA; Poole, C				Mansournia, Mohammad Ali; Poole, Charles			Case-control matching on confounders revisited	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Matching; Case-control study; Confounding; Selection bias	CAUSAL DIAGRAMS; DESIGN; COLLAPSIBILITY; VALIDITY; CONFIDENCE; EFFICIENCY; MODELS; RISK	Matching by a confounder in a case-control study nearly always produces a control-selection bias that mixes with the confounding to produce a net bias. Previous theoretical work has assumed that control for a single confounder, the matching factor, is sufficient to remove all the confounding and that the confounder-exposure, confounder-outcome and exposure-outcome associations are monotonic. Under these conditions: (a) The net bias is toward the null if the exposure affects the outcome and nil if it does not. (b) If the confounding is away from the null, the selection bias is toward the null. (c) If the confounding is toward the null, the selection bias can be in any direction or even nil. If more than one confounder needs to be controlled to remove all the confounding, the net bias from matching by one of them can be away from the null, whether the exposure affects the outcome or not. An influential heuristic, that matching controls to cases by a variable associated with exposure always brings the marginal exposure distributions of the case and control groups closer together, turns out to be faulty. The implications of matching by confounders in case-control studies are less straightforward than previously thought. Suggestions are offered for advancing the methodologic literature on this topic.

However, this framework is not insulated from spatial confounding, a topic of significant interest in cancer epidemiology, where the latent correlation between the spatial random effects and fixed effects (such as covariates), often lead to misleading interpretation. Aims To introduce three popular approaches (RHZ,HHandSPOCK; details in paper) often employed to tackle spatial confounding, and illustrate their implementation in cancer research via the popular statistical softwareR. Methods As a solution to alleviate spatial confounding, restricted spatial regressions are constructed by either projecting the latent effect onto the orthogonal space of covariates, or by displacing the spatial locations. Popular parametric count data models, such as the Poisson, generalized Poisson and negative binomial, were considered for the areal count responses, while the spatial association is quantified via the conditional autoregressive (CAR) model. Our method of inference in Bayesian, sometimes aided by the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) to accelerate computing. The methods are implemented in theRpackageRASCOavailable from the first author'sGitHubpage. Results The results reveal that all three methods perform well in alleviating the bias and variance inflation present in the spatial models. The effects of spatial confounding were also explored, which, if ignored in practice, may lead to wrong conclusions. Conclusion Spatial confounding continues to remain a critical bottleneck in deriving precise inference from spatial DM models. Hence, its effects must be investigated, and mitigated. Several approaches are available in the literature, and they produce trustworthy results. The central contribution of this paper is providing the practitioners theRpackageRASCO, capable of fitting a large number of spatial models, as well as their restricted versions.	[Azevedo, Douglas R.

Causal Inference in Cancer Epidemiology: What Is the Role of Mendelian Randomization?	CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY BIOMARKERS & PREVENTION			English	Review							BODY-MASS INDEX; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; DENSITY-LIPOPROTEIN CHOLESTEROL; NATURALLY RANDOM ALLOCATION; PROSTATE-CANCER; LUNG-CANCER; VITAMIN-E; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES	Observational epidemiologic studies are prone to confounding, measurement error, and reverse causation, undermining robust causal inference. Mendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic variants to proxy modifiable exposures to generate more reliable estimates of the causal effects of these exposures on diseases and their outcomes. MR has seen widespread adoption within cardio-metabolic epidemiology, but also holds much promise for identifying possible interventions for cancer prevention and treatment. However, some methodologic challenges in the implementation of MR are particularly pertinent when applying this method to cancer etiology and prognosis, including reverse causation arising from disease latency and selection bias in studies of cancer progression. These issues must be carefully considered to ensure appropriate design, analysis, and interpretation of such studies. In this review, we provide an overview of the key principles and assumptions of MR, focusing on applications of this method to the study of cancer etiology and prognosis. We summarize recent studies in the cancer literature that have adopted a MR framework to highlight strengths of this approach compared with conventional epidemiological studies. Finally, limitations of MR and recent methodologic developments to address them are discussed, along with the translational opportunities they present to inform public health and clinical interventions in cancer.

For any given DAG, a set of graphical rules can be applied to identify minimally sufficient adjustment sets that can be used to adjust for bias due to confounding when estimating the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome. The daggle app is a web-based application that aims to assist in the learning and teaching of adjustment set identification using DAGs.General features The application offers two modes: tutorial and random. The tutorial mode presents a guided introduction to how common causal structures can be presented using DAGs and how graphical rules can be used to identify minimally sufficient adjustment sets for causal estimation. The random mode tests this understanding by presenting the user with a randomly generated DAG-a daggle. To solve the daggle, users must correctly identify a valid minimally sufficient adjustment set.Implementation The daggle app is implemented as an R shiny application using the golem framework. The application builds upon existing R libraries including pcalg to generate reproducible random DAGs, dagitty to identify all valid minimal adjustment sets and ggdag to visualize DAGs.

To incorporate the correlated nature of the data, we employ mixed-effects models and a sandwich estimator to make inferences on the average causal effect (ACE). Our methods apply the concept of potential outcomes from the Rubin Causal Model (Holland in J Am Stat Assoc 81(396):945-960, 1986), and extend Schafer and Kang's methods of estimating the variance of the ACE (Schafer and Kang in Psychol Methods 13(4):279-313, 2008). Particularly, we develop two model-based approaches to estimate the ACE and its variance under a dual-modeling strategy which adjusts for the confounding effect through inverse probability weighting. These two approaches use linear mixed-effects models for the estimation of potential outcomes, but differ in how clustering is handled in the treatment assignment model. We present a summary of our comprehensive simulation study assessing the repetitive sampling properties of the two approaches in a pseudo-random simulation environment. Finally, we report our findings from an application to study the ACE of inadequate prenatal care on birth weight among low-income women in New York State.

We examine this setting further, giving theoretical and empirical results concerning the frequentist and Bayesian performance of random coefficient regression. Particularly, we compare estimators based on this adjustment for residual confounding to estimators based on the assumption of no residual confounding. This devolves to comparing an estimator from a nonidentified but more realistic model to an estimator from a less realistic but identified model. The approach described by Gustafson (2005, Statistical Science 20, 111-140) is used to quantify the performance of a Bayesian estimator arising from a nonidentified model. From both theoretical calculations and simulations we find support for the idea that superior performance can be obtained by replacing unrealistic identifying constraints with priors that allow modest departures from those constraints. In terms of point-estimator bias this superiority arises when the extent of residual confounding is substantial, but the advantage is much broader in terms of interval estimation. The benefit from modeling residual confounding is maintained when the prior distributions employed only roughly correspond to reality, for the standard identifying constraints are equivalent to priors that typically correspond much worse.

J	Bendtsen, M; McCambridge, J				Bendtsen, Marcus; McCambridge, Jim			Causal models accounted for research participation effects when estimating effects in a behavioral intervention trial	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Research participation effects; Behavioral interventions; Randomized controlled trials; Causal models; Bias; Statistical analysis	PSYCHOLOGY; DRUG	Objective: Participants in intervention studies are asked to take part in activities linked to the conduct of research, including signing consent forms and being assessed. If participants are affected by such activities through mechanisms by which the intervention is intended to work, then there is confounding. We examine how to account for research participation effects analytically. Study design and setting: Data from a trial of a brief alcohol intervention among Swedish university students is used to show how a proposed causal model can account for assessment effects. Results: The proposed model can account for research participation effects as long as researchers are willing to use existing data to make assumptions about causal influences, for instance on the magnitude of assessment effects. The model can incorporate several research processes which may introduce bias. Conclusions: As our knowledge grows about research participation effects, we may move away from asking if participants are affected by study design, toward rather asking by how much they are affected, by which activities and in which circumstances. The analytic perspective adopted here avoids assuming there are no research participation effects. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Potential confounding by exposure history and prior outcomes - An example from perinatal epidemiology	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; CLEARER DEFINITION; PREGNANCY OUTCOMES; CAUSAL INFERENCE; RISK; DEFECTS; TIME; BIAS	Prior pregnancy outcomes, such as spontaneous abortion and preterm birth, are often predictive of future pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, many researchers adjust for reproductive history. Although this adjustment may be appropriate for a predictive model, it is not necessarily appropriate when the goal is to obtain an unbiased estimate of the effect of exposure on disease. Reproductive history may seem to meet the conventional criteria for confounding because it is unlikely to be on the causal pathway between exposure and current outcome, is often associated with current outcome, and may be associated with exposure as well. However, whether reproductive history is a confounder or not depends on the underlying reason for its associations with exposure and current outcome. Thus, conventional methods for assessing confounding are often inadequate. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) can be used to evaluate complex scenarios for confounding when the research question is clearly defined with respect to the exposure, the outcome, and the effect estimate of interest. Special care is required when reproductive history affects future exposure. We use 5 DAGs to illustrate possible relations between reproductive history and current outcome. We assess each DAG for confounding, and identify the appropriate analytic technique. We provide a numeric example using data from the Collaborative Perinatal Project. There is no single answer as to whether reproductive history should be included in the model; the decision depends on the research question and the underlying DAG.

PROMISE-EBF Study Grp	Assessing causal effects of early life-course factors on early childhood caries in 5-year-old Ugandan children using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs): A prospective cohort study	COMMUNITY DENTISTRY AND ORAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						ECC; epidemiology; paediatric dentistry; public health; statistics	DENTAL-CARIES; RISK-FACTORS; BACKGROUND FACTORS; HEALTH; PREVALENCE; DURATION; MALNUTRITION; ASSOCIATIONS; CONSUMPTION; NUTRITION	Objective: To estimate the effect of distal and proximal early life-course factors on early childhood caries (ECC) in 5-year-old Ugandan children, particularly focusing on the causal effect of exclusive breast feeding (EBF) on ECC using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for confounder selection. Methods: This study had a nested prospective cohort design, focusing on 5 years of follow-ups of caregiver-children pairs from the PROMISE-EBF trial (ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT00397150) conducted in 2011 in Eastern Uganda. Data were from recruitment interviews, 24-week, 2-year and 5-year follow-ups of a cohort of 417 mother-children pairs. Trained research assistants performed interviews with caregivers in the local language and ECC was recorded under field conditions using the World Health Organization's (WHO) decayed missing or filled teeth (dmft) index. Early life-course factors in terms of socio-demographic characteristics, EBF and other feeding habits were assessed at the various follow-ups. The outcome (ECC; dmft>0) was assessed at the 5-year follow-up. Causal diagrams as DAGs were constructed to guide the selection of confounding and collider variables to be included in or excluded from the final multivariable analysis. Negative binomial regression analyses were performed based on two comparative DAGs representing different causal models. Results: Model 1 based on DAG 1, showed EBF to be a protective factor against ECC, with an IRR and 95% CI of 0.62 (0.43-0.91). According to Model 2 based on DAG 2, EBF and having both parents living together had protective effects: the corresponding IRRs and 95% CI were 0.60 (0.41-0.88) and 0.48 (0.25-0.90), respectively. Conclusions: Both plausible models indicated that being exclusively breastfed for 24 weeks had a protective causal effect against ECC. Further research, examining the unmeasured variables included in the DAGs is necessary to strengthen the present finding and allow stronger causal claims.

Assumptions of IV Methods for Observational Epidemiology	STATISTICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Causal inference; instrumental variables; Mendelian randomization; relative bias; structural mean models	CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; COUNT DATA MODELS; MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION; CAUSAL INFERENCE; INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES; GENETIC ASSOCIATION; NONCOMPLIANCE; METAANALYSIS; DIAGRAMS; IDENTIFICATION	Instrumental variable (IV) methods are becoming increasingly popular as they seem to offer the only viable way to overcome the problem of unobserved confounding in observational studies. However, some attention has to be paid to the details, as not all such methods target the same causal parameters and some rely on more restrictive parametric assumptions than others. We therefore discuss and contrast the most common IV approaches with relevance to typical applications in observational epidemiology. Further, we illustrate and compare the asymptotic bias of these IV estimators when underlying assumptions are violated in a numerical study. One of our conclusions is that all IV methods encounter problems in the presence of effect modification by unobserved confounders. Since this can never be ruled out for sure, we recommend that practical applications of IV estimators be accompanied routinely by a sensitivity analysis.

This problem is paramount in medicine, where we would like to answer causal questions from large observational datasets like electronic health records (EHRs) and administrative claims. Modern medical data typically contain tens of thousands of covariates. Such a large set carries hope that many of the confounders are directly measured, and further hope that others are indirectly measured through their correlation with measured covariates. How can we exploit these large sets of covariates for causal inference? To help answer this question, this paper examines the performance of the large-scale propensity score (LSPS) approach on causal analysis of medical data. We demonstrate that LSPS may adjust for indirectly measured confounders by including tens of thousands of covariates that may be correlated with them. We present conditions under which LSPS removes bias due to indirectly measured confounders, and we show that LSPS may avoid bias when inadvertently adjusting for variables (like colliders) that otherwise can induce bias. We demonstrate the performance of LSPS with both simulated medical data and real medical data.

Study Design: Meta-epidemiological study. Setting: MSM-studies providing effect estimates on any healthcare outcome of any treatment were eligible. We systematically sought RCTs on the same clinical question and compared the direction of treatment effects, effect sizes, and confidence intervals. Results: The main analysis included 19 MSM-studies (1,039,570 patients) and 141 RCTs (120,669 patients). MSM-studies indicated effect estimates in the opposite direction from RCTs for eight clinical questions (42%), and their 95% CI (confidence interval) did not include the RCT estimate in nine clinical questions (47%). The effect estimates deviated 1.58-fold between the study designs (median absolute deviation OR [odds ratio] 1.58; IQR [interquartile range] 1.37 to 2.16). Overall, we found no systematic disagreement regarding benefit or harm but confidence intervals were wide (summary ratio of odds ratios [sROR] 1.04; 95% CI 0.88 to 1.23). The subset of MSM-studies focusing on healthcare decision-making tended to overestimate experimental treatment benefits (sROR 1.44; 95% CI 0.99 to 2.09). Conclusion: Nonrandomized studies using causal modeling with MSM may give different answers than RCTs. Caution is still required when nonrandomized "real world" evidence is used for healthcare decisions. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Immigrant; Ethnicity; Confounding; Adjustment; Mediator; Total effect; Controlled direct effect; Directed acyclic graphs; Collider bias; Selection bias	MEDIATION ANALYSIS; CAUSAL; MORTALITY; BIRTH; BIAS; RACE	BackgroundWhen quantifying differences in health outcomes between immigrants and non-immigrants, it is common practice to adjust for observed differences in outcome risk factors between the groups being compared. However, as some of these outcome risk factors may act as mediators on the causal path between the exposure and outcome, adjusting for these may remove effects of factors that characterize the immigrants rather than removing a bias between immigrants and non-immigrants.MethodsThis study investigates the underlying conditions for which adjusting for outcome risk factors in regression models can lead to the estimation of either total or direct effect for the difference in health outcomes between immigrants and non-immigrants. For this investigation, we use modern tools in causal inference to construct causal models that we believe are highly relevant in an immigrant dataset. In these models, the outcome risk factor is modeled either as a mediator, a selection factor, or a combined mediator/selection factor. Unlike mediators, selection factors are variables that affect the probability of being in the immigrant dataset and may contribute to a bias when comparing immigrants and non-immigrants.ResultsWhen the outcome risk factor acts both as a mediator and selection factor, the adjustment for the risk factor in regression models leads to the estimation of what is known as a "controlled" direct effect. When the outcome risk factor is either a selection factor or a mediator alone, the adjustment for the risk factor in regression models leads to the estimation of a total effect or a controlled direct effect, respectively. In all regression analyses, also adjusting for various confounding paths, including mediator-outcome confounding, may be necessary to obtain valid controlled direct effects or total effects.ConclusionsDepending on the causal role of the outcome risk factors in immigrant datasets, regression adjustment for these may result in the estimation of either total effects or controlled direct effects for the difference in outcomes between immigrants and non-immigrants. Because total and controlled direct effects are interpreted differently, we advise researchers to clarify to the readers which types of effects are presented when adjusting for outcome risk factors in immigrant datasets.

In this issue of the Journal, Sturmer et al. (Am J Epidemiol 2007:165:1110-18) offer a novel solution that combines propensity score matching methods with measurement error regression models. They call this technique "propensity score calibration" (PSC) and assess its strengths and limitations with simulated data. Their analyses demonstrate that PSC greatly improves inference when the critical assumption of surrogacy holds, but when surrogacy does not hold, PSC estimation can exacerbate bias relative to uncorrected propensity score models. The benefits of propensity score methods (and PSC) lie not only with potentially improved effect estimation but with conceptualization and practice as well.

Exploring and mitigating potential bias when genetic instrumental variables are associated with multiple non-exposure traits in Mendelian randomization	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Mendelian randomization; Confounding; Selection bias; Pleiotropy; Causal diagram; UK Biobank	MEDIATION; HEALTH	With the increasing size and number of genome-wide association studies, individual single nucleotide polymorphisms are increasingly found to associate with multiple traits. Many different mechanisms could result in proposed genetic IVs for an exposure of interest being associated with multiple non-exposure traits, some of which could bias MR results. We describe and illustrate, through causal diagrams, a range of scenarios that could result in proposed IVs being related to non-exposure traits in MR studies. These associations could occur due to five scenarios: (i) confounding, (ii) vertical pleiotropy, (iii) horizontal pleiotropy, (iv) reverse causation and (v) selection bias. For each of these scenarios we outline steps that could be taken to explore the underlying mechanism and mitigate any resulting bias in the MR estimation. We recommend MR studies explore possible IV-non-exposure associations across a wider range of traits than is usually the case. We highlight the pros and cons of relying on sensitivity analyses without considering particular pleiotropic paths versus systematically exploring and controlling for potential pleiotropic or other biasing paths via known traits. We apply our recommendations to an illustrative example of the effect of maternal insomnia on offspring birthweight in UK Biobank.

From bad to worse: collider stratification amplifies confounding bias in the "obesity paradox"	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Obesity paradox; Confounding bias; Selection bias	MORTALITY; SMOKING	Smoking is often identified as a confounder of the obesity-mortality relationship. Selection bias can amplify the magnitude of an existing confounding bias. The objective of the present report is to demonstrate how confounding bias due to cigarette smoking is increased in the presence of collider stratification bias using an empirical example and directed acyclic graphs. The empirical example uses data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, a prospective cohort study of 15,792 men and women in the United States. Poisson regression models were used to examine the confounding effect of smoking. In the total ARIC study population, smoking produced a confounding bias of < 3 percentage points. This result was obtained by comparing the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for obesity from a model adjusted for smoking was 1.07 (95 % CI 1.00, 1.15) with one that did not adjust for smoking was 1.10 (95 % CI 1.03, 1.18). However, among smokers with CVD, the obesity IRR was 0.89 (95 % CI 0.81, 0.99), while among non-smokers with CVD the obesity IRR was 1.20 (95 % CI 1.03, 1.41). The empirical and graphical explanations presented suggest that the magnitude of the confounding bias induced by smoking is greater in the presence of collider stratification bias.

J	Craycroft, JA; Huang, JP; Kong, MY				Craycroft, John A.; Huang, Jiapeng; Kong, Maiying			Propensity score specification for optimal estimation of average treatment effect with binary response	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Propensity score; causal inference; variable selection; observational data; average treatment effect; confounders	VARIABLE SELECTION; TUTORIAL	Propensity score methods are commonly used in statistical analyses of observational data to reduce the impact of confounding bias in estimations of average treatment effect. While the propensity score is defined as the conditional probability of a subject being in the treatment group given that subject's covariates, the most precise estimation of average treatment effect results from specifying the propensity score as a function of true confounders and predictors only. This property has been demonstrated via simulation in multiple prior research articles. However, we have seen no theoretical explanation as to why this should be so. This paper provides that theoretical proof. Furthermore, this paper presents a method for performing the necessary variable selection by means of elastic net regression, and then estimating the propensity scores so as to obtain optimal estimates of average treatment effect. The proposed method is compared against two other recently introduced methods, outcome-adaptive lasso and covariate balancing propensity score. Extensive simulation analyses are employed to determine the circumstances under which each method appears most effective. We applied the proposed methods to examine the effect of pre-cardiac surgery coagulation indicator on mortality based on a linked dataset from a retrospective review of 1390 patient medical records at Jewish Hospital (Louisville, KY) with the Society of Thoracic Surgeons database.

In the observational setting, confounding is a barrier to the estimation of causal effects. Weighting approaches seek to control for confounding by reweighting samples so that confounders are comparable across different treatment values. Yet, for continuous treatments, weighting methods are highly sensitive to model misspecification. In this article we elucidate the key property that makes weights effective in estimating causal quantities involving continuous treatments. We show that to eliminate confounding, weights should make treatment and confounders independent on the weighted scale. We develop a measure that characterizes the degree to which a set of weights induces such independence. Further, we propose a new model-free method for weight estimation by optimizing our measure. We study the theoretical properties of our measure and our weights, and prove that our weights can explicitly mitigate treatment-confounder dependence. The empirical effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated in a suite of challenging numerical experiments, where we find that our weights are quite robust and work well under a broad range of settings. for this article are available online.

Prioritizing Variables for Observational Study Design using the Joint Variable Importance Plot	AMERICAN STATISTICIAN			English	Article; Early Access						Graphical methods; Inference; Variable selection	BALANCE; HETEROGENEITY; INFERENCE; WEIGHTS; BIAS	Observational studies of treatment effects require adjustment for confounding variables. However, causal inference methods typically cannot deliver perfect adjustment on all measured baseline variables, and there is often ambiguity about which variables should be prioritized. Standard prioritization methods based on treatment imbalance alone neglect variables' relationships with the outcome. We propose the joint variable importance plot to guide variable prioritization for observational studies. Since not all variables are equally relevant to the outcome, the plot adds outcome associations to quantify the potential confounding jointly with the standardized mean difference. To enhance comparisons on the plot between variables with different confounding relationships, we also derive and plot bias curves. Variable prioritization using the plot can produce recommended values for tuning parameters in many existing matching and weighting methods. We showcase the use of the joint variable importance plots in the design of a balance-constrained matched study to evaluate whether taking an antidiabetic medication, glyburide, increases the incidence of C-section delivery among pregnant individuals with gestational diabetes.

J	Xu, Q; Antimisiaris, D; Kong, MY				Xu, Qian; Antimisiaris, Demetra; Kong, Maiying			Statistical methods for assessing drug interactions using observational data	JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Drug interaction; generalized propensity score; marginal structural models; multinomial logistic regression	PROPENSITY SCORE; CAUSAL INFERENCE; VARIABLE SELECTION; COMORBIDITIES; DESIGN; MODELS; INDEX	With advances in medicine, many drugs and treatments become available. On the one hand, polydrug use (i.e. using more than one drug at a time) has been used to treat patients with multiple morbid conditions, and polydrug use may cause severe side effects. On the other hand, combination treatments have been successfully developed to treat severe diseases such as cancer and chronic diseases. Observational data, such as electronic health record data, may provide useful information for assessing drug interactions. In this article, we propose using marginal structural models to assess the average treatment effect and causal interaction of two drugs by controlling confounding variables. The causal effect and the interaction of two drugs are assessed using the weighted likelihood approach, with weights being the inverse probability of the treatment assigned. Simulation studies were conducted to examine the performance of the proposed method, which showed that the proposed method was able to estimate the causal parameters consistently. Case studies were conducted to examine the joint effect of metformin and glyburide use on reducing the hospital readmission for type 2 diabetic patients, and to examine the joint effect of antecedent statins and opioids use on the immune and inflammatory biomarkers for COVID-19 hospitalized patients.

Implementation of Instrumental Variable Bounds for Data Missing Not at Random	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							SELECTION; MODELS	Instrumental variables are routinely used to recover a consistent estimator of an exposure causal effect in the presence of unmeasured confounding. Instrumental variable approaches to account for nonignorable missing data also exist but are less familiar to epidemiologists. Like instrumental variables for exposure causal effects, instrumental variables for missing data rely on exclusion restriction and instrumental variable relevance assumptions. Yet these two conditions alone are insufficient for point identification. For estimation, researchers have invoked a third assumption, typically involving fairly restrictive parametric constraints. Inferences can be sensitive to these parametric assumptions, which are typically not empirically testable. The purpose of our article is to discuss another approach for leveraging a valid instrumental variable. Although the approach is insufficient for nonparametric identification, it can nonetheless provide informative inferences about the presence, direction, and magnitude of selection bias, without invoking a third untestable parametric assumption. An important contribution of this article is an Excel spreadsheet tool that can be used to obtain empirical evidence of selection bias and calculate bounds and corresponding Bayesian 95% credible intervals for a nonidentifiable population proportion. For illustrative purposes, we used the spreadsheet tool to analyze HIV prevalence data collected by the 2007 Zambia Demographic and Health Survey (DHS).	[Marden, Jessica R.; Tchetgen, Eric J.

James			An instrumental variable procedure for estimating Cox models with non-proportional hazards in the presence of unmeasured confounding	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Causal inference; Control function; Cox regression model; Time-dependent coefficients; Time-modified confounding	CAUSAL INFERENCE; FRAILTY MODELS; SURVIVAL; BIAS	Two-stage instrumental variable methods are commonly used for estimating average causal effects in the presence of an unmeasured confounder. In the context of the proportional hazard Cox regression models, this problem has recently received attention with several methods being proposed. Previously, we developed an improved estimator under the incumbent two-stage residual inclusion procedure called '2SRI' by adding a Gaussian frailty in the second stage. We now consider the more complex situation in which the treatment and the unmeasured confounders can have time varying effects, illustrating the method with the case of a step function with one prespecified change point. We prove that, in situations where the effects of the unmeasured confounder or the treatment change during the follow-up, the first stage of the 2SRI algorithm induces a frailty with time varying coefficients in the second stage, which enables incumbent methods and our previously developed procedure to be improved on. A Monte Carlo simulation study demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed extension of 2SRI that we develop. We apply the new procedure to estimate the effect of endarterectomy versus carotid artery stenting on the time to death of patients suffering from carotid artery disease by using linked vascular quality initiative registry-Medicare data.

However, they are often not always feasible, and causal treatment effects must be estimated from observational data. Observational studies do not allow robust conclusions about causal relationships unless statistical techniques account for the imbalance of pretreatment confounders across groups and key assumptions hold. Propensity score and balance weighting (PSBW) are useful techniques that aim to reduce the observed imbalances between treatment groups by weighting the groups to look alike on the observed confounders. Notably, there are many methods available to estimate PSBW. However, it is unclear a priori which will achieve the best trade-off between covariate balance and effective sample size for a given application. Moreover, it is critical to assess the validity of key assumptions required for robust estimation of the needed treatment effects, including the overlap and no unmeasured confounding assumptions. We present a step-by-step guide to the use of PSBW for estimation of causal treatment effects that includes steps on how to evaluate overlap before the analysis, obtain estimates of PSBW using multiple methods and select the optimal one, check for covariate balance on multiple metrics, and assess sensitivity of findings (both the estimated treatment effect and statistical significance) to unobserved confounding. We illustrate the key steps using a case study examining the relative effectiveness of substance use treatment programs and provide a user-friendly Shiny application that can implement the proposed steps for any application with binary treatments.

This tutorial gives an overview in situations where an exposure of interest is set at a chosen baseline ("point exposure") and the target outcome arises at a later time point. We first phrase relevant causal questions and make a case for being specific about the possible exposure levels involved and the populations for which the question is relevant. Using the potential outcomes framework, we describe principled definitions of causal effects and of estimation approaches classified according to whether they invoke the no unmeasured confounding assumption (including outcome regression and propensity score-based methods) or an instrumental variable with added assumptions. We mainly focus on continuous outcomes and causal average treatment effects. We discuss interpretation, challenges, and potential pitfalls and illustrate application using a "simulation learner," that mimics the effect of various breastfeeding interventions on a child's later development. This involves a typical simulation component with generated exposure, covariate, and outcome data inspired by a randomized intervention study. The simulation learner further generates various (linked) exposure types with a set of possible values per observation unit, from which observed as well as potential outcome data are generated. It thus provides true values of several causal effects. R code for data generation and analysis is available on , where SAS and Stata code for analysis is also provided.

Comparative Effectiveness of Prostate Cancer Treatments: Evaluating Statistical Adjustments for Confounding in Observational Data	JNCI-JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE			English	Article							ANDROGEN DEPRIVATION THERAPY; INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE METHODS; HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY; PROPENSITY SCORE; RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY; BREAST-CANCER; MEDICARE CLAIMS; SELF-SELECTION; LUNG-CANCER; MEN	Background Using observational data to assess the relative effectiveness of alternative cancer treatments is limited by patient selection into treatment, which often biases interpretation of outcomes. We evaluated methods for addressing confounding in treatment and survival of patients with early-stage prostate cancer in observational data and compared findings with those from a benchmark randomized clinical trial. Methods We selected 14 302 early-stage prostate cancer patients who were aged 66-74 years and had been treated with radical prostatectomy or conservative management from linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 2003. Eligibility criteria were similar to those from a clinical trial used to benchmark our analyses. Survival was measured through December 31, 2007, by use of Cox proportional hazards models. We compared results from the benchmark trial with results from models with observational data by use of traditional multivariable survival analysis, propensity score adjustment, and instrumental variable analysis. Results Prostate cancer patients receiving conservative management were more likely to be older, nonwhite, and single and to have more advanced disease than patients receiving radical prostatectomy. In a multivariable survival analysis, conservative management was associated with greater risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality ( hazard ratio [HR] = 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.27 to 2.00) and all-cause mortality ( HR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.35 to 1.59) than radical prostatectomy. Propensity score adjustments resulted in similar patient characteristics across treatment groups, although survival results were similar to traditional multivariable survival analyses. Results for the same comparison from the instrumental variable approach, which theoretically equalizes both observed and unobserved patient characteristics across treatment groups, differed from the traditional multivariable and propensity score results but were consistent with findings from the subset of elderly patient with early-stage disease in the trial (ie, conservative management vs radical prostatectomy: for prostate cancer-specific mortality, HR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.08 to 6.73; for all-cause mortality, HR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.46 to 2.59). Conclusion Instrumental variable analysis may be a useful technique in comparative effectiveness studies of cancer treatments if an acceptable instrument can be identified.

However, logistic regression modeling faces challenges such as overfitting, confounding, and multicollinearity when there is a large number of explanatory variables. For example, in the birth defect study presented in this paper, variable selection for building high quality models to identify risk factors from hundreds of pollutant variables is difficult. To address this problem, we propose a novel visual analytics approach to logistic regression modeling for high-dimensional datasets. It leverages the traditional modeling pipeline by providing (1) intuitive visualizations for inspecting statistical indicators and the relationships among the variables and (2) a seamless, effective dimension reduction pipeline for selecting variables for inclusion in high quality logistic regression models. A fully working prototype of this approach has been developed and successfully applied to the birth defect study, which illustrates its effectiveness and efficiency. Its application in an insurance policy study and feedback from domain experts further demonstrate its usefulness.	[Zhang, Chong; Yang, Jing] Univ N Carolina, Charlotte, NC 28223 USA; [Zhan, F.

But to what extent is health selection driven by prior social causation? This paper quantifies the extent to which health selection here, restricted or downward intergenerational social class mobility due to poor mental health or behavioural problems can be attributed to the influence of modifiable childhood risk factors. The UK National Child Development Study provides measures of socioeconomic deprivation and childhood adversities, as well as multiple-informant ratings of adolescents' mental health and behavioural problems, for which confirmatory factor analysis supports a three-factor model. Decomposition analysis is used to robustly assess the extent of attenuation of selection effects when conditioning on the childhood environment. Conduct problems, hyperactivity, and to a lesser extent emotional symptoms at age 16 are associated with individuals' chances of achieving (un)desirable mobility outcomes. When prior childhood risk factors are taken into account, the association of conduct problems with mobility is attenuated by around 50%, indicating a substantial role for confounding and earlier processes of social causation in the generation of this health selection effect. Further analyses indicate that this attenuation is greater for those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds and is mostly driven by the inclusion of indicators of generalised disadvantage such as crowded housing and low income. On the other hand, the effects of emotional symptoms and hyperactivity on mobility outcomes are not significantly accounted for by childhood risk factors. This study adds to the health inequalities literature by interrogating the empirical validity of the usual interpretation of health selection effects as indicating the causal priority of the onset of poor mental health.

Based on the data collected from 773 participants in Personal Genome Project database, we employ the causal inference methods to estimate the treatment effects of high cholesterol on myopia. In our approach, we first estimate the average treatment effect for treated group (high cholesterol participants) on myopia by conducting two causal inference methods. Afterwards, we verify our estimation by performing pseudo treatment and sensitivity analysis. Based on our research, participants with high cholesterol have a chance of getting myopia 10% higher than if they did not have high cholesterol. Our findings lead to a new path for biomedical researchers to discover the novel genome-wide causation, from which the causal effect of high cholesterol on myopia is derived.

An illustration of the bias-variance trade-off in air pollution epidemiology	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Air pollution; Bias; Children's respiratory health; Confounding; Prenatal exposure	RESPIRATORY HEALTH; 1ST YEAR; NITROGEN-DIOXIDE; DIAGNOSED ASTHMA; EXPOSURE; SYMPTOMS; PREGNANCY; OUTDOOR; URBAN; INFECTIONS	Background: Spatially-resolved air pollution models can be developed in large areas. The resulting increased exposure contrasts and population size offer opportunities to better characterize the effect of atmospheric pollutants on respiratory health. However the heterogeneity of these areas may also enhance the potential for confounding. We aimed to discuss some analytical approaches to handle this trade-off. Methods: We modeled NO2 and PM10 concentrations at the home addresses of 1082 pregnant mothers from EDEN cohort living in and around urban areas, using ADMS dispersion model. Simulations were performed to identify the best strategy to limit confounding by unmeasured factors varying with area type. We examined the relation between modeled concentrations and respiratory health in infants using regression models with and without adjustment or interaction terms with area type. Results: Simulations indicated that adjustment for area limited the bias due to unmeasured confounders varying with area at the costs of a slight decrease in statistical power. In our cohort, rural and urban areas differed for air pollution levels and for many factors associated with respiratory health and exposure. Area tended to modify effect measures of air pollution on respiratory health. Conclusions: Increasing the size of the study area also increases the potential for residual confounding. Our simulations suggest that adjusting for type of area is a good option to limit residual confounding due to area-associated factors without restricting the area size. Other statistical approaches developed in the field of spatial epidemiology are an alternative to control for poorly-measured spatially-varying confounders. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Cox, LA				Cox, Louis Anthony			Improving interventional causal predictions in regulatory risk assessment	CRITICAL REVIEWS IN TOXICOLOGY			English	Review						Causality; PM2.5; mortality risk; risk assessment; proportional-hazards model	BODY-MASS INDEX; AIR-POLLUTION; LUNG-CANCER; CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY; PARTICULATE MATTER; BETA-CAROTENE; ALL-CAUSE; EXPOSURE; ASSOCIATION; POPULATION	In 2022, the US EPA published an important risk assessment concluding that "Compared to the current annual standard, meeting a revised annual standard with a lower level is estimated to reduce PM2.5-associated health risks in the 30 annually-controlled study areas by about 7-9% for a level of 11.0 mu g/m(3) horizontal ellipsis and 30-37% for a level of 8.0 mu g/m(3)." These are interventional causal predictions: they predict percentage reductions in mortality risks caused by different counterfactual reductions in fine particulate (PM2.5) levels. Valid causal predictions are possible if: (1) Study designs are used that can support valid causal inferences about the effects of interventions (e.g., quasi-experiments with appropriate control groups); (2) Appropriate causal models and methods are used to analyze the data; (3) Model assumptions are satisfied (at least approximately); and (4) Non-causal sources of exposure-response associations such as confounding, measurement error, and model misspecification are appropriately modeled and adjusted for. This paper examines two long-term mortality studies selected by the EPA to predict reductions in PM2.5-associated risk. Both papers use Cox proportional hazards (PH) models. For these models, none of these four conditions is satisfied, making it difficult to interpret or validate their causal predictions. Scientists, reviewers, regulators, and members of the public can benefit from more trustworthy and credible risk assessments and causal predictions by insisting that risk assessments supporting interventional causal conclusions be based on study designs, methods, and models that are appropriate for predicting effects caused by interventions.

Using examples from large health care database studies, this article provides the clinicians with an overview of standard methods in the analysis phase, such as stratification, standardization, multivariable regression analysis and propensity score (PS) methods, together with the more advanced high-dimensional propensity score (HD-PS) method. We describe the progression from simple stratification confined to the inclusion of a few potential confounders to complex modeling procedures such as the HD-PS approach by which hundreds of potential confounders are extracted from large health care databases. Stratification and standardization assist in the understanding of the data at a detailed level, while accounting for potential confounders. Incorporating several potential confounders in the analysis typically implies the choice between multivariable analysis and PS methods. Although PS methods have gained remarkable popularity in recent years, there is an ongoing discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of PS methods as compared to those of multivariable analysis. Furthermore, the HD-PS method, despite its generous inclusion of potential confounders, is also associated with potential pitfalls. All methods are dependent on the assumption of no unknown, unmeasured and residual confounding and suffer from the difficulty of identifying true confounders. Even in large health care databases, insufficient or poor data may contribute to these challenges. The trend in data collection is to compile more fine-grained data on lifestyle and severity of diseases, based on self-reporting and modern technologies. This will surely improve our ability to incorporate relevant confounders or their proxies. However, despite a remarkable development of methods that account for confounding and new data opportunities, confounding will remain a serious issue. Considering the advantages and disadvantages of different methods, we emphasize the importance of the clinical input and of the interplay between clinicians and analysts to ensure a proper analysis.

The transdisciplinary field of molecular pathological epidemiology (MPE) integrates molecular pathological and epidemiological methods, and takes advantages of improved understanding of pathogenesis to generate stronger biological evidence of causality and optimize strategies for precision medicine and prevention. Disease subtyping based on biomarker analysis of biospecimens is essential in MPE research. However, there are nearly always cases that lack subtype information due to the unavailability or insufficiency of biospecimens. To address this missing subtype data issue, we incorporated inverse probability weights into Cox proportional cause-specific hazards regression. The weight was inverse of the probability of biomarker data availability estimated based on a model for biomarker data availability status. The strategy was illustrated in two example studies; each assessed alcohol intake or family history of colorectal cancer in relation to the risk of developing colorectal carcinoma subtypes classified by tumor microsatellite instability (MSI) status, using a prospective cohort study, the Nurses' Health Study. Logistic regression was used to estimate the probability of MSI data availability for each cancer case with covariates of clinical features and family history of colorectal cancer. This application of IPW can reduce selection bias caused by nonrandom variation in biospecimen data availability. The integration of causal inference methods into the MPE approach will likely have substantial potentials to advance the field of epidemiology.

BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Causal inference; Multiple imputation; Outcome regression; Observational study; Missing data; Target trial	FULLY CONDITIONAL SPECIFICATION; RESPONSES; BIAS	BackgroundDespite recent advances in causal inference methods, outcome regression remains the most widely used approach for estimating causal effects in epidemiological studies with a single-point exposure and outcome. Missing data are common in these studies, and complete-case analysis (CCA) and multiple imputation (MI) are two frequently used methods for handling them. In randomised controlled trials (RCTs), it has been shown that MI should be conducted separately by treatment group. In observational studies, causal inference is now understood as the task of emulating an RCT, which raises the question of whether MI should be conducted by exposure group in such studies.MethodsWe addressed this question by evaluating the performance of seven methods for handling missing data when estimating causal effects with outcome regression. We conducted an extensive simulation study based on an illustrative case study from the Victorian Adolescent Health Cohort Study, assessing a range of scenarios, including seven outcome generation models with exposure-confounder interactions of differing strength.ResultsThe simulation results showed that MI by exposure group led to the least bias when the size of the smallest exposure group was relatively large, followed by MI approaches that included the exposure-confounder interactions.ConclusionsThe findings from our simulation study, which was designed based on a real case study, suggest that current practice for the conduct of MI in causal inference may need to shift to stratifying by exposure group where feasible, or otherwise including exposure-confounder interactions in the imputation model.

In particular, many IV methods have been developed for right-censored time-to-event outcomes. In this paper, we consider a much more complicated situation where one faces interval-censored time-to-event outcomes, which are ubiquitously present in studies with, for example, intermittent follow-up but are challenging to handle in terms of both theory and computation. A sieve maximum likelihood estimation procedure is proposed for estimating complier causal treatment effects under the additive hazards model, and the resulting estimators are shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal. A simulation study is conducted to evaluate the finite sample performance of the proposed approach and suggests that it works well in practice. It is applied to a breast cancer screening study.

However, a significant amount of work in the field has been descriptive and correlational, which prevents the findings from being more rigorously translated into practices and policies. This article provides a review of the popular models and methods for causal network analysis, with a focus on causal inference threats (such as measurement error, missing data, network endogeneity, contextual confounding, simultaneity, and collinearity) and potential solutions (such as instrumental variables, specialized experiments, and leveraging longitudinal data). It covers major models and methods for both network formation and network effects and for both sociocentric networks and egocentric networks. Lastly, this review also discusses future directions for causal network analysis.

However, this approach raises methodological challenges that can limit the validity of findings. Objective: The aims of this paper are 1) to present the value of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to identify and mitigate potential problems related to confounding and selection bias, and 2) to question the meaning of a cumulative ACE score. Results: Adjusting for variables that post-date childhood could block mediated pathways that are part of the total causal effect while conditioning on adult variables, which often serve as proxies for childhood variables, can create collider stratification bias. Because exposure to ACEs can affect the likelihood of reaching adulthood or study entry, selection bias could be introduced via restricting selection on a variable affected by ACEs in the presence of unmeasured confounding. In addition to challenges regarding causal structure, using a cumulative score of ACEs assumes that each type of adversity will have the same effect on a given outcome, which is unlikely considering differing risk across adverse experiences. Conclusions: DAGs provide a transparent approach of the researchers' assumed causal relationships and can be used to overcome issues related to confounding and selection bias. Researchers should be explicit about their operationalization of ACEs and how it is to be interpreted in the context of the research question they are trying to answer.

Evaluating Comparative Effectiveness With Observational Data Endoscopic Ultrasound and Survival in Pancreatic Cancer	CANCER			English	Article						selection bias; propensity score; instrumental variable; endoscopic ultrasound; pancreatic cancer	ANDROGEN-DEPRIVATION-THERAPY; PROPENSITY SCORE METHODS; FINE-NEEDLE-ASPIRATION; PROSTATE-CANCER; BIAS; OUTCOMES; EUS; ULTRASONOGRAPHY; ADENOCARCINOMA; DIAGNOSIS	BACKGROUNDA previous observational study reported that endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is associated with improved survival in older patients with pancreatic cancer. The objective of this study was to reevaluate this association using different statistical methods to control for confounding and selection bias. METHODSSurveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked data (1992-2007) was used to identify patients with locoregional pancreatic cancer. Two-year survival in patients who did and did not receive EUS was compared by using standard Cox proportional hazards models, propensity score methodology, and instrumental variable analysis. RESULTSEUS was associated with improved survival in both unadjusted (hazard ratio [HR]=0.67, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.63-0.72) and standard regression analyses (HR=0.78, 95% CI=0.73-0.84) which controlled for age, sex, race, marital status, tumor stage, SEER region, Charlson comorbidity, year of diagnosis, education, preoperative biliary stenting, chemotherapy, radiation, and pancreatic resection. Propensity score adjustment, matching, and stratification did not attenuate this survival benefit. In an instrumental variable analysis, the survival benefit was no longer observed (HR=1.00, 95% CI=0.73-1.36). CONCLUSIONSThese results demonstrate the need to exercise caution in using administrative data to infer causal mortality benefits with diagnostic and/or treatment interventions in cancer research.

Failure to handle neighbourhood self-selection can lead to biased estimates of the association between the neighbourhood environment and behaviour. This means that effects could be over- or under-estimated, both of which have implications for public health policies related to neighbourhood (re)design. Therefore, it is important that methods to deal with neighbourhood self-selection are identified and reviewed. The aim of this review was to assess how neighbourhood self-selection is conceived and accounted for in the literature. Methods Articles from a systematic search undertaken in 2017 were included if they examined associations between neighbourhood environment exposures and adult physical activity or dietary behaviour. Exposures could include any objective measurement of the built (e.g., supermarkets), natural (e.g., parks) or social (e.g., crime) environment. Articles had to explicitly state that a given method was used to account for neighbourhood self-selection. The systematic review was registered with the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (number CRD42018083593) and was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Results Of 31 eligible articles, almost all considered physical activity (30/31); few examined diet (2/31). Methods used to address neighbourhood self-selection varied. Most studies (23/31) accounted for items relating to participants' neighbourhood preferences or reasons for moving to the neighbourhood using multi-variable adjustment in regression models (20/23) or propensity scores (3/23). Of 11 longitudinal studies, three controlled for neighbourhood self-selection as an unmeasured confounder using fixed effects regression. Conclusions Most studies accounted for neighbourhood self-selection by adjusting for measured attributes of neighbourhood preference. However, commonly the impact of adjustment could not be assessed. Future studies using adjustment should provide estimates of associations with and without adjustment for self-selection; consider temporality in the measurement of self-selection variables relative to the timing of the environmental exposure and outcome behaviours; and consider the theoretical plausibility of presumed pathways in cross-sectional research where causal direction is impossible to establish.

Instrumental variables as bias amplifiers with general outcome and confounding	BIOMETRIKA			English	Article						Causal inference; Directed acyclic graph; Interaction; Monotonicity; Potential outcome	PROPENSITY SCORE METHODS; CAUSAL; DISTRIBUTIONS; COLLAPSIBILITY; AMPLIFICATION; ASSOCIATION; BALANCE; BALLOON; DESIGN; MODELS	Drawing causal inference with observational studies is the central pillar of many disciplines. One sufficient condition for identifying the causal effect is that the treatment-outcome relationship is unconfounded conditional on the observed covariates. It is often believed that the more covariates we condition on, the more plausible this unconfoundedness assumption is. This belief has had a huge impact on practical causal inference, suggesting that we should adjust for all pretreatment covariates. However, when there is unmeasured confounding between the treatment and outcome, estimators adjusting for some pretreatment covariate might have greater bias than estimators that do not adjust for this covariate. This kind of covariate is called a bias amplifier, and includes instrumental variables that are independent of the confounder and affect the outcome only through the treatment. Previously, theoretical results for this phenomenon have been established only for linear models. We fill this gap in the literature by providing a general theory, showing that this phenomenon happens under a wide class of models satisfying certain monotonicity assumptions.

It has been evaluated in comparative effectiveness research (CER) with point treatments to handle baseline confounding through matching or covariance adjustment on the hdPS. In observational studies with time-varying interventions, such hdPS approaches are often inadequate to handle time-dependent confounding and selection bias. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimation to fit marginal structural models can adequately handle these biases under the fundamental assumption of no unmeasured confounders. Upholding of this assumption relies on the selection of an adequate set of covariates for bias adjustment. We describe the application and performance of the hdPS algorithm to improve covariate selection in CER with time-varying interventions based on IPW estimation and explore stabilization of the resulting estimates using Super Learning. The evaluation is based on both the analysis of electronic health records data in a real-world CER study of adults with type 2 diabetes and a simulation study. This report (i) establishes the feasibility of IPW estimation with the hdPS algorithm based on large electronic health records databases, (ii) demonstrates little impact on inferences when supplementing the set of expert-selected covariates using the hdPS algorithm in a setting with extensive background knowledge, (iii) supports the application of the hdPS algorithm in discovery settings with little background knowledge or limited data availability, and (iv) motivates the application of Super Learning to stabilize effect estimates based on the hdPS algorithm.

J	Pearl, J				Pearl, Judea			An Introduction to Causal Inference	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOSTATISTICS			English	Article						structural equation models; confounding; graphical methods; counterfactuals; causal effects; potential-outcome; mediation; policy evaluation; causes of effects	MEDIATION; IDENTIFICATION; DIAGRAMS; EXPOSURE; DESIGN; MODELS; BOUNDS; EXCHANGEABILITY; IDENTIFIABILITY; PROBABILITY	This paper summarizes recent advances in causal inference and underscores the paradigmatic shifts that must be undertaken in moving from traditional statistical analysis to causal analysis of multivariate data. Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underlie all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: those about (1) the effects of potential interventions, (2) probabilities of counterfactuals, and (3) direct and indirect effects (also known as "mediation"). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both. The tools are demonstrated in the analyses of mediation, causes of effects, and probabilities of causation.

J	Waernbaum, I; Pazzagli, L				Waernbaum, Ingeborg; Pazzagli, Laura			Model misspecification and bias for inverse probability weighting estimators of average causal effects	BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						average causal effects; comparing biases; outcome model; propensity score	DOUBLY ROBUST ESTIMATION; MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; PROPENSITY SCORE; MISSING DATA; BLOOD LEAD; INFERENCE; EFFICIENT	Commonly used semiparametric estimators of causal effects specify parametric models for the propensity score (PS) and the conditional outcome. An example is an augmented inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimator, frequently referred to as a doubly robust estimator, because it is consistent if at least one of the two models is correctly specified. However, in many observational studies, the role of the parametric models is often not to provide a representation of the data-generating process but rather to facilitate the adjustment for confounding, making the assumption of at least one true model unlikely to hold. In this paper, we propose a crude analytical approach to study the large-sample bias of estimators when the models are assumed to be approximations of the data-generating process, namely, when all models are misspecified. We apply our approach to three prototypical estimators of the average causal effect, two IPW estimators, using a misspecified PS model, and an augmented IPW (AIPW) estimator, using misspecified models for the outcome regression (OR) and the PS. For the two IPW estimators, we show that normalization, in addition to having a smaller variance, also offers some protection against bias due to model misspecification. To analyze the question of when the use of two misspecified models is better than one we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for when the AIPW estimator has a smaller bias than a simple IPW estimator and when it has a smaller bias than an IPW estimator with normalized weights. If the misspecification of the outcome model is moderate, the comparisons of the biases of the IPW and AIPW estimators show that the AIPW estimator has a smaller bias than the IPW estimators. However, all biases include a scaling with the PS-model error and we suggest caution in modeling the PS whenever such a model is involved. For numerical and finite sample illustrations, we include three simulation studies and corresponding approximations of the large-sample biases. In a dataset from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we estimate the effect of smoking on blood lead levels.

J	Ellison, GTH				Ellison, George T. H.			COVID-19 and the epistemology of epidemiological models at the dawn of AI	ANNALS OF HUMAN BIOLOGY			English	Editorial Material							SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; SELECTION BIAS; CHALLENGES; PREDICTION; DIAGNOSIS; PROGNOSIS; DISEASE; SPREAD; ISSUES; TIME	The models used to estimate disease transmission, susceptibility and severity determine what epidemiology can (and cannot tell) us about COVID-19. These include: 'model organisms' chosen for their phylogenetic/aetiological similarities; multivariable statistical models to estimate the strength/direction of (potentially causal) relationships between variables (through 'causal inference'), and the (past/future) value of unmeasured variables (through 'classification/prediction'); and a range of modelling techniques to predict beyond the available data (through 'extrapolation'), compare different hypothetical scenarios (through 'simulation'), and estimate key features of dynamic processes (through 'projection'). Each of these models: address different questions using different techniques; involve assumptions that require careful assessment; and are vulnerable to generic and specific biases that can undermine the validity and interpretation of their findings. It is therefore necessary that the models used: can actually address the questions posed; and have been competently applied. In this regard, it is important to stress that extrapolation, simulation and projection cannot offer accurate predictions of future events when the underlying mechanisms (and the contexts involved) are poorly understood and subject to change. Given the importance of understanding such mechanisms/contexts, and the limited opportunity for experimentation during outbreaks of novel diseases, the use of multivariable statistical models to estimate the strength/direction of potentially causal relationships between two variables (and the biases incurred through their misapplication/misinterpretation) warrant particular attention. Such models must be carefully designed to address: 'selection-collider bias', 'unadjusted confounding bias' and 'inferential mediator adjustment bias' - all of which can introduce effects capable of enhancing, masking or reversing the estimated (true) causal relationship between the two variables examined.1 Selection-collider bias occurs when these two variables independently cause a third (the 'collider'), and when this collider determines/reflects the basis for selection in the analysis. It is likely to affect all incompletely representative samples, although its effects will be most pronounced wherever selection is constrained (e.g. analyses focusing on infected/hospitalised individuals). Unadjusted confounding bias disrupts the estimated (true) causal relationship between two variables when: these share one (or more) common cause(s); and when the effects of these causes have not been adjusted for in the analyses (e.g. whenever confounders are unknown/unmeasured). Inferentially similar biases can occur when: one (or more) variable(s) (or 'mediators') fall on the causal path between the two variables examined (i.e. when such mediators are caused by one of the variables and are causes of the other); and when these mediators are adjusted for in the analysis. Such adjustment is commonplace when: mediators are mistaken for confounders; prediction models are mistakenly repurposed for causal inference; or mediator adjustment is used to estimate direct and indirect causal relationships (in a mistaken attempt at 'mediation analysis'). These three biases are central to ongoing and unresolved epistemological tensions within epidemiology. All have substantive implications for our understanding of COVID-19, and the future application of artificial intelligence to 'data-driven' modelling of similar phenomena. Nonetheless, competently applied and carefully interpreted, multivariable statistical models may yet provide sufficient insight into mechanisms and contexts to permit more accurate projections of future disease outbreaks.

Despite the extensive research on the efficacy of aesthetic graphic layouts, the causal inference domain has not benefited from the results of this research. In this paper, we investigate the performance of graph visualisations for supporting users' understanding of causal graphs. Two studies were conducted to compare graph visualisations for understanding causation and identifying confounding variables in a causal graph. The first study results suggest that while adjacency matrix layouts are better for understanding direct causation, node-link diagrams are better for understanding mediated causation along causal paths. The second study revealed that node-link layouts, and in particular layouts created by a radial algorithm, are more effective for identifying confounder and collider variables.

Multivariable models allow adjustment for known and readily measurable prognostic factors, but they may incompletely or inaccurately represent the underlying overall perceived risk of treatment. To incorporate practitioners' judgments about treatment indication and preprocedural prognosis into an observational study of cerebral aneurysm treatments, the author and colleagues presented patient characteristics and radiographic images from 179 aneurysm cases (University of California, San Francisco, 1990-1997) to panels of practitioners who were blinded as to actual treatment selection and outcome. In this way, the review process was designed to recreate the presentation of information in a prospective study. Judgments about inclusion and prognosis were reproducible. Perceived prognosis correlated with complication rates and provided information not present in a multivariable model including all available clinical characteristics. The association between treatment modality and outcome was examined while stratifying and adjusting for differences in perceived prognosis. Blinded prospective review may provide an unbiased observational study design with which to define a cohort that could have received any of the treatments being compared and to measure and adjust for overall perceived procedural risk.

History-adjusted marginal structural models for estimating time-varying effect modification	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						antiretroviral therapy; highly active; causality; confounding factors (epidemiology); HIV; longitudinal studies; observational data; structural model; time-dependent covariate		Much of epidemiology and clinical medicine is focused on estimating the effects of treatments or interventions administered over time. In such settings of longitudinal treatment, time-dependent confounding is often an important source of bias. Marginal structural models (MSMs) are a powerful tool for estimating the causal effect of a treatment using observational data, particularly when time-dependent confounding is present. In recent statistical work, van der Laan et al. presented a generalized form of MSMs called "history-adjusted" MSMs (Int J Biostat 2005; 1:article 4). Unlike standard MSMs, history-adjusted MSMs can be used to estimate modification of treatment effects by time-varying covariates. Estimation of time-dependent causal effect modification is frequently of great practical relevance. For example, clinical researchers are often interested in how the prognostic significance of a biomarker for treatment response can change overtime. This article provides a practical introduction to the implementation and interpretation of history-adjusted MSMs. The method is illustrated using a clinical question drawn from the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus infection. Observational cohort data from San Francisco, California, collected between 2000 and 2004, are used to estimate the effect of time until switching antiretroviral therapy regimens among patients receiving a nonsuppressive regimen and how this effect differs depending on CD4-positive T-lymphocyte count.

The authors conducted a large simulation study of other influences on confidence interval coverage, type I error, relative bias, and other model performance measures. They found a range of circumstances in which coverage and bias were within acceptable levels despite less than 10 EPV, as well as other factors that were as influential as or more influential than EPV. They conclude that this rule can be relaxed, in particular for sensitivity analyses undertaken to demonstrate adequate control of confounding.

J	Johnson, D; Pieper, K; Yang, S				Johnson, Dana; Pieper, Karen; Yang, Shu			Treatment-specific marginal structural Cox model for the effect of treatment discontinuation	PHARMACEUTICAL STATISTICS			English	Article						articifial censoring; causal inference; discontinuation; inverse probability weighting; time-dependent confounding	ATRIAL-FIBRILLATION; STROKE; WARFARIN; RISK; PERSISTENCE	Patients taking a prescribed medication often discontinue their treatment; however, this may negatively impact their health outcomes. If doctors had statistical evidence that discontinuing some prescribed medication shortened, on average, the time to a clinical event (e.g., death), they could use that knowledge to encourage their patients to stay on the prescribed treatment. We describe a treatment-specific marginal structural Cox model for estimation of the causal effect of treatment discontinuation on a survival endpoint. The effect of treatment discontinuation is quantified by the hazard ratio of the event hazard rate had the population followed the regime "take treatment alpha until it is discontinued at some time nu," versus the event hazard rate had the population never discontinued treatment alpha. Valid causal analysis requires control for treatment confounding, regime confounding, and censoring due to regime violation. We propose new inverse probability of regime compliance weights to address the three issues simultaneously. We apply the framework to data from the Global Anticoagulant Registry in the FIELD-Atrial Fibrillation (GARFIELD-AF) study. Patients from this study are treated with one of two types of oral anticoagulants (OACs). We test whether the causal effect of treatment discontinuation differs by type of OAC, and we also estimate the size and direction of the effect. We find evidence that OAC discontinuation increases the hazard for certain events, but we do not find evidence that this effect differs by treatment.

For evaluation of the impact of adjustment, adjusted IRRs should be compared with crude IRRs. The aim of this methodological study was to present a statistical approach for testing the equality of adjusted and crude IRRs and to derive a confidence interval for the ratio of the two IRRs. The method can be extended to compare two differently adjusted IRRs and, thus, to evaluate the effect of additional adjustment. The method runs immediately on existing software. To illustrate the application of this approach, the authors studied adjusted IRRs for two risk factors of type 2 diabetes using data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Potsdam Study from 2005. The statistical method described may be helpful as an additional tool for analyzing epidemiologic cohort data and for interpreting results obtained from Cox regression models with adjustment for different covariates.

J	Tan, ZQ				Tan, Zhiqiang			A distributional approach for causal inference using propensity scores	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						causal inference; control variate; nonparametric likelihood; observational study; propensity score; sensitivity analysis	SEMIPARAMETRIC REGRESSION; REPEATED OUTCOMES; SENSITIVITY; MODELS; ADJUSTMENT; EXOGENEITY; BIAS	Drawing inferences about the effects of treatments and actions is a common challenge in economics, epidemiology, and other fields. We adopt Rubin's potential outcomes framework for causal inference and propose two methods serving complementary purposes. One can be used to estimate average causal effects, assuming no confounding given measured covariates. The other can be used to assess how the estimates might change under various departures from no confounding. Both methods are developed from a nonparametric likelihood perspective. The propensity score plays a central role and is estimated through a parametric model. Under the assumption of no confounding, the joint distribution of covariates and each potential outcome is estimated as a weighted empirical distribution. Expectations from the joint distribution are estimated as weighted averages or, equivalently to first order, regression estimates. The likelihood estimator is at least as efficient and the regression estimator is at least as efficient and robust as existing estimators. Regardless of the no-confounding assumption, the marginal distribution of covariates times the conditional distribution of observed outcome given each treatment assignment and covariates is estimated. For a fixed bound on unmeasured confounding, the marginal distribution of covariates times the conditional distribution of counterfactual outcome given each treatment assignment and covariates is explored to the extreme and then compared with the composite distribution corresponding to observed outcome given the same treatment. assignment and covariates. We illustrate the methods by analyzing the data from an observational study on right heart catheterization.

We derive narrower bounds by adding assumptions regarding bias due to confounding. This bias is defined as the difference between the expectation of potential outcomes for the exposed group and that for the unexposed group. We show that crude effect measures bound causal effects under the given assumptions. We then derive bounds for randomized studies with noncompliance, which are given by the per protocol effect. With perfect compliance in one treatment group, the direction of effect becomes identifiable under our assumptions. Although the assumptions are not themselves identifiable, they are nonetheless reasonable in some situations. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Statistical methods can only address selection bias if they make plausible assumptions. No quality assessment tool is available for appraising CEAs that use observational studies. We developed a new checklist to assess statistical methods for addressing selection bias in CEAs that use observational data. The checklist criteria were informed by a conceptual review and applied in a systematic review of economic evaluations. Criteria included whether the study assessed the no unobserved confounding' assumption, overlap of baseline covariates between the treatment groups and the specification of the regression models. The checklist also considered structural uncertainty from the choice of statistical approach. We found 81 studies that met the inclusion criteria: studies tended to use regression (51%), matching on individual covariates (25%) or matching on the propensity score (22%). Most studies (77%) did not assess the no observed confounding' assumption, and few studies (16%) fully considered structural uncertainty from the choice of statistical approach. We conclude that published CEAs do not assess the main assumptions behind statistical methods for addressing selection bias. This checklist can raise awareness about the assumptions behind statistical methods for addressing selection bias and can complement existing method guidelines for CEAs.

Statistical and epidemiological issues related to the design and analysis of studies based on this biomarker are addressed. Methods: A systematic review of recent literature on the buccal MN assay has been carried out to provide a state-of-the-art evaluation of how critical topics such as control for confounding, sample size and statistical power, number of cells scored, endpoint selection, and statistical modelling, are considered. In addition, a meta-analysis has been performed to estimate the impact of most common confounders on MN frequency, and to provide a baseline value of MN frequency in the control population. Results: A total number of 63 eligible studies were included in the analysis. Age (98.4%), gender (85.7%), and smoking habit (90.5%) were the most commonly studied confounders. Univariate statistics were estimated in most studies while multivariate analysis was applied only in the 47.6%. Baseline MN frequency in controls was 1.10/1000 cells (95% confidence interval 0.70-1.72), and the relative increment in subjects exposed to genotoxic agents or affected by disease correlated with similar observations in lymphocytes (R-2 = 0.74). A minimum number of 4000 cells is recommended to reduce the variability of the MN mean estimates, in contrast with the current practice of scoring only 2000 cells (81% of studies). Poisson or Negative Binomial are the preferred statistical models when more than 2000 cells are scored. Studies scoring smaller numbers of cells should consider the use of statistical models taking into account the excess of zeros, e.g., the Zero Inflated Poisson (ZIP) models. Conclusions: The quality of papers published on the buccal MN assay can be substantially improved, with better consideration of basic issues such as power analysis, control for confounding, choice of the statistical model, and the number of cells to be scored.

Estimating the GPS with parametric models obliges researchers to meet improbable conditions such as correct model specification, normal distribution of variables, and large sample sizes. Objectives: The purpose of this Monte Carlo simulation study is to examine the performance of neural networks as compared to full factorial regression models to estimate GPS in the presence of Gaussian and skewed treatment doses and small to moderate sample sizes. Research design: A detailed conceptual introduction of neural networks is provided, as well as an illustration of selection of hyperparameters to estimate GPS. An example from public health and nutrition literature uses residential distance as a treatment variable to illustrate how neural networks can be used in a propensity score analysis to estimate a dose-response function of grocery spending behaviors. Results: We found substantially higher correlations and lower mean squared error values after comparing true GPS with the scores estimated by neural networks. The implication is that more selection bias was removed using GPS estimated with neural networks than using GPS estimated with classical regression. Conclusions: This study proposes a new methodological procedure, neural networks, to estimate GPS. Neural networks are not sensitive to the assumptions of linear regression and other parametric models and have been shown to be a contender against parametric approaches to estimate propensity scores for continuous treatments.

J	Sheikh, MA				Sheikh, Mashhood Ahmed			Confounding and Statistical Significance of Indirect Effects: Childhood Adversity, Education, Smoking, and Anxious and Depressive Symptomatology	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						directeffect; proportion of mediated effect; decomposition; mediation; confounding; anxiety; depression; longitudinal	LIFE-COURSE PATHWAYS; MENTAL-HEALTH; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; MAJOR DEPRESSION; EARLY ADULTHOOD; PHYSICAL HEALTH; YOUNG ADULTHOOD; SOCIAL SUPPORT; OLDER-ADULTS	The life course perspective, the risky families model, and stress-and-coping models provide the rationale for assessing the role of smoking as a mediator in the association between childhood adversity and anxious and depressive symptomatology (ADS) in adulthood. However, no previous study has assessed the independent mediating role of smoking in the association between childhood adversity and ADS in adulthood. Moreover, the importance of mediator-response confounding variables has rarely been demonstrated empirically in social and psychiatric epidemiology. The aim of this paper was to (i) assess the mediating role of smoking in adulthood in the association between childhood adversity and ADS in adulthood, and (ii) assess the change in estimates due to different mediator-response confounding factors (education, alcohol intake, and social support). The present analysis used data collected from 1994 to 2008 within the framework of the Tromso Study (N = 4,530), a representative prospective cohort study of men and women. Seven childhood adversities (low mother's education, low father's education, low financial conditions, exposure to passive smoke, psychological abuse, physical abuse, and substance abuse distress) were used to create a childhood adversity score. Smoking status was measured at a mean age of 54.7 years (Tromso IV), and ADS in adulthood was measured at a mean age of 61.7 years (Tromso V). Mediation analysis was used to assess the indirect effect and the proportion of mediated effect (%) of childhood adversity on ADS in adulthood via smoking in adulthood. The test-retest reliability of smoking was good (Kappa: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.63; 0.71) in this sample. Childhood adversity was associated with a 10% increased risk of smoking in adulthood (Relative risk: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.03; 1.18), and both childhood adversity and smoking in adulthood were associated with greater levels of ADS in adulthood (p < 0.001). Smoking in adulthood did not significantly mediate the association between childhood adversity and ADS in adulthood. However, when education was excluded as a mediator-response confounding variable, the indirect effect of childhood adversity on ADS in adulthood was statistically significant (p < 0.05). This study shows that a careful inclusion of potential confounding variables is important when assessing mediation.

This study addresses this issue by using functional magnetic resonance imaging-based stochastic dynamic causal modeling (DCM) analysis to study the effective connectivity of 19 cocaine-dependent subjects and 14 healthy controls while performing a working memory task. Stochastic DCM is an advanced method that has recently been implemented in SPM8 that can obtain improved estimates, relative to deterministic DCM, of hidden neuronal causes before convolution with the hemodynamic response. Thus, stochastic DCM may be less influenced by the confounding effects of variations in blood oxygen level-dependent response caused by disease or drugs. Based on the significant regional activation common to both groups and consistent with previous working memory activation studies, seven regions of interest were chosen as nodes for DCM analyses. Bayesian family level inference, Bayesian model selection analyses, and Bayesian model averaging (BMA) were conducted. BMA showed that the cocaine-dependent subjects had large differences compared with the control subjects in the strengths of prefrontal-striatal modulatory (B matrix) DCM parameters.

A Comparison of Methods to Estimate the Hazard Ratio Under Conditions of Time-varying Confounding and Nonpositivity	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							CAUSAL INFERENCE; MORTALITY; EXPOSURE; MODEL; SELECTION; SURVIVAL; BIAS	In occupational epidemiologic studies, the healthy worker survivor effect refers to a process that leads to bias in the estimates of an association between cumulative exposure and a health outcome. In these settings, work status acts both as an intermediate and confounding variable and may violate the positivity assumption (the presence of exposed and unexposed observations in all strata of the confounder). Using Monte Carlo simulation, we assessed the degree to which crude, work-status adjusted, and weighted (marginal structural) Cox proportional hazards models are biased in the presence of time-varying confounding and nonpositivity. We simulated the data representing time-varying occupational exposure, work status, and mortality. Bias, coverage, and root mean squared error (MSE) were calculated relative to the true marginal exposure effect in a range of scenarios. For a base-case scenario, using crude, adjusted, and weighted Cox models, respectively, the hazard ratio was biased downward 19%, 9%, and 6%; 95% confidence interval coverage was 48%, 85%, and 91%; and root MSE was 0.20, 0.13, and 0.11. Although marginal structural models were less biased in most scenarios studied, neither standard nor marginal structural Cox proportional hazards models fully resolve the bias encountered under conditions of time-varying confounding and nonpositivity.

The models underlying many of these analyses are inadequate, and consequently many SNP-heritability results published to date are inaccurate. Here, we review the modelling issues, both for analyses based on individual genotype data and association test statistics, highlighting the role of a low-dimensional model for the heritability of each SNP. We use state-of-art models to present updated results about how heritability is distributed with respect to functional annotations in the human genome, and how it varies with allele frequency, which can reflect purifying selection. Our results give finer detail to the picture that has emerged in recent years of complex trait heritability widely dispersed across the genome. Confounding due to population structure remains a problem that summary statistic analyses cannot reliably overcome.

This graphical framework may arise in many biomedical studies, for example, when a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of interest is contaminated with undirected edges induced by some unobserved confounding factors (eg, unmeasured environmental factors). Directed edges in a DAG are widely used to evaluate causal relationships among variables in a network, but detecting them is challenging when the underlying causality is obscured by some shared latent factors. The objective of this paper is to develop an effective structural equation model (SEM) method to extract reliable causal relationships from a DAMG. The proposed approach, termedstructural factor equation model (SFEM), uses the SEM to capture the network topology of the DAG while accounting for the undirected edges in the graph with a factor analysis model. The latent factors in the SFEM enable the identification and removal of undirected edges, leading to a simpler and more interpretable causal network. The proposed method is evaluated and compared to existing methods through extensive simulation studies, and illustrated through the construction of gene regulatory networks related to breast cancer.

Confounding by Dietary Patterns of the Inverse Association Between Alcohol Consumption and Type 2 Diabetes Risk	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						alcohol drinking; bias (epidemiology); confounding factors (epidemiology); diabetes mellitus; type 2; diet; factor analysis; statistical; least-squares analysis; proportional hazards models	PROPENSITY SCORE; DRINKING PATTERNS; HEART-DISEASE; VALIDITY; REPRODUCIBILITY; MELLITUS; BIAS	The ability to interpret epidemiologic observations is limited because of potential residual confounding by correlated dietary components. Dietary pattern analyses by factor analysis or partial least squares may overcome the limitation. To examine confounding by dietary pattern as well as standard risk factors and selected nutrients, the authors modeled the longitudinal association between alcohol consumption and 7-year risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in 2,879 healthy adults enrolled in the Framingham Offspring Study (1991-2001) by Cox proportional hazard models. After adjustment for standard risk factors, consumers of >= 9.0 drinks/week had a significantly lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with abstainers (hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.27, 0.81). Adjustment for selected nutrients had little effect on the hazard ratio, whereas adjustment for dietary pattern variables by factor analysis significantly shifted the hazard ratio away from null (hazard ratio = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.64) by 40.0% (95% CI: 16.8, 57.0; P = 0.002). Dietary pattern variables by partial least squares showed similar results. Therefore, the observed inverse association, consistent with past studies, was confounded by dietary patterns, and this confounding was not captured by individual nutrient adjustment. The data suggest that alcohol intake, not dietary patterns associated with alcohol intake, is responsible for the observed inverse association with type 2 diabetes mellitus risk.

The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Instrumental-variables regression; neighbourhoods; retail food environment; obesity; weight; endogeneity	OBESITY; DIET; INTERVENTION; SELECTION; ACCESS; HEALTH	Background: Findings in the observational retail food environment and obesity literature are inconsistent, potentially due to a lack of adjustment for residual confounding. Methods: Using data from the CARDIA study (n = 12 174 person-observations; 6 examinations; 1985-2011) across four US cities (Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis, MN; Oakland, CA), we used instrumental-variables (IV) regression to obtain causal estimates of the longitudinal associations between the percentage of neighbourhood food stores or restaurants (per total food outlets within 1 km network distance of respondent residence) with body mass index (BMI), adjusting for individual-level socio-demographics, health behaviours, city, year, total food outlets and market-level prices. To determine the presence and extent of bias, we compared the magnitude and direction of results with ordinary least squares (OLS) and random effects (RE) regression, which do not control for residual confounding, and with fixed effects (FE) regression, which does not control for time-varying residual confounding. Results: Relative to neighbourhood supermarkets (which tend to be larger and have healthier options than grocery stores), a higher percentage of grocery stores [mean=53.4%; standard deviation (SD) = 31.8%] was positively associated with BMI [beta = 0.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.01, 0.10] using IV regression. However, associations were negligible or null using OLS (beta = -0.001; 95% CI = -0.01, 0.01), RE (beta = -0.003; 95% CI = -0.01, 0.0001) and FE (beta = -0.003; 95% CI = -0.01, 0.0002) regression. Neighbourhood convenience stores and fast-food restaurants were not associated with BMI in any model. Conclusions: Longitudinal associations between neighbourhood food outlets and BMI were greater in magnitude using a causal model, suggesting that weak findings in the literature may be due to residual confounding.

For instance, one could estimate the impact of a new drug on specific individuals to assist clinical planning and improve the survival rate. In this paper, we focus on studying the problem of estimating the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) from observational data. The challenges for this problem are two-fold: on the one hand, we have to derive a causal estimator to estimate the causal quantity from observational data, in the presence of confounding bias; on the other hand, we have to deal with the identification of the CATE when the distributions of covariates over the treatment group units and the control units are imbalanced. To overcome these challenges, we propose a neural network framework called Adversarial Balancing-based representation learning for Causal Effect Inference (ABCEI), based on recent advances in representation learning. To ensure the identification of the CATE, ABCEI uses adversarial learning to balance the distributions of covariates in the treatment and the control group in the latent representation space, without any assumptions on the form of the treatment selection/assignment function. In addition, during the representation learning and balancing process, highly predictive information from the original covariate space might be lost. ABCEI can tackle this information loss problem by preserving useful information for predicting causal effects under the regularization of a mutual information estimator. The experimental results show that ABCEI is robust against treatment selection bias, and matches/outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. Our experiments show promising results on several datasets, encompassing several health care (and other) domains.

In particular, the role and interpretation of random effects models are examined. The modeling of spatial variability is considered and related to an underlying continuous spatial field. The examination of such a field with respect to the modeling of risk in relation to a point source highlights an inconsistency in commonly used approaches. A theme of the paper is to examine how plausible individual-level models relate to those used in practice at the aggregate level. The individual-level models acknowledge confounding, within-area variability in exposures and confounders, measurement error and data anomalies and so we can examine how the area-level versions consider these aspects. We briefly discuss designs that efficiently sample individual data and would appear to be useful in environmental settings.

We examined a cohort of 24,680 new users who were 4-17 years of age at the incident dispensing from the Population-Based Effectiveness in Asthma and Lung Diseases (PEAL) Network of 5 commercial health plans and TennCare, the Tennessee Medicaid program, during the period January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2010. The 3 methods yielded similar results, indicating that pediatric patients treated with leukotriene antagonists were no more likely than those treated with inhaled corticosteroids to experience adverse outcomes. Children in the TennCare population who had a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis and who then initiated the use of leukotriene antagonists were less likely to experience an asthma-related emergency department visit. A plausible explanation is that our data set is large enough that the 2 advanced propensity score-based analyses do not have advantages over the traditional covariate-adjusted regression approach. We provide important observations on how to correctly apply the methods in observational data analysis and suggest statistical research areas that need more work to guide implementation.

Diagnostics for confounding in PK/PD models for oxcarbazepine	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						pharmacokinetics; pharmacodynamics; pediatric bridging; potential outcomes; Rubin's causal model; sensitivity analysis; instrumental variables; two-stage least squares	CAUSAL; INFERENCE; SMOKING	One type of phannacokinetic/pharrnacodynarnic (PK/PD) relationship that is used to characterize the therapeutic action of a drug is the relationship between some univariate summary of the plasmaconcentration-versus-time profile and the drug effect on a response outcome. Operationally, such a relationship may be observed in a large clinical trial where randomly sampled patients are randomized to different values of the concentration summary. If, under such conditions, the relationship between concentration and effect does not depend on the dose needed to attain the target concentration, such a relationship will be called a true PK/PD relationship. When the true PK/PD relationship is assessed as an object of estimation in a dose-controlled clinical trial (i.e. when dose is randomized), observed drug concentration is an outcome variable. The estimated PK/PD relationship between observed outcome and observed concentration, which we then refer to as the conventional PK/PD relationship, may be biased for the true PK/PD relationship. Because of this bias, the conventional relationship is called confounded for the true one. We show that diagnostics for confounding can be devised under reasonable assumptions. We then apply these diagnostics to PK/PD assessments of adults and children on oxcarbazepine adjunctive therapy. It was necessary to demonstrate the similarity of the true PK/PD relationships of adults and children on adjunctive therapy in order to support the approval of oxcarbazepine monotherapy in children by a bridging argument.

When estimating the effect of a time-varying treatment or exposure on an outcome of interest measured at a later time, standard methods fail to give consistent estimators in the presence of time-varying confounders if those confounders are themselves affected by the treatment. Robins and colleagues have proposed several alternative methods that, provided certain assumptions hold, avoid the problems associated with standard approaches. They include the g-computation formula, inverse probability weighted estimation of marginal structural models and g-estimation of structural nested models. In this tutorial, we give a description of each of these methods, exploring the links and differences between them and the reasons for choosing one over the others in different settings.

Arden, III			Estimating long-term pollution exposure effects through inverse probability weighting methods with Cox proportional hazards models	ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Fine particulate matter; Inverse probability of treatment weighting; Mortality; National Health Interview Survey; Pollution	FINE PARTICULATE MATTER; CANADIAN CENSUS HEALTH; AIR-POLLUTION; FOLLOW-UP; CAUSAL INFERENCE; MILLION ADULTS; MORTALITY; DISEASE; ASSOCIATIONS; PM2.5	Background: Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with negative health outcomes in both the short and long term. However, the cohort studies that have produced many of the estimates of long-term exposure associations may fail to account for selection bias in pollution exposure as well as covariate imbalance in the study population; therefore, causal modeling techniques may be beneficial. Methods: Twenty-nine years of data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) was compiled and linked to modeled annual average outdoor PM2.5 concentration and restricted-use mortality data. A series of Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted using inverse probability weights, yielded causal risk estimates of long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 on all-cause and cardiopulmonary mortality. Results: Covariate-adjusted estimated relative risks per 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 exposure were estimated to be 1.117 (1.083, 1.152) for all-cause mortality and 1.232 (1.174, 1.292) for cardiopulmonary mortality. Inverse probability weighted Cox models provide relatively consistent and robust estimates similar to those in the unweighted baseline multivariate Cox model, though they have marginally lower point estimates and higher standard errors. Conclusions: These results provide evidence that long-term exposure to PM2.5 contributes to increased mortality risk in US adults and that the estimated effects are generally robust to modeling choices. The size and robustness of estimated associations highlight the importance of clean air as a matter of public health. Estimated confounding due to measured covariates appears minimal in the NHIS cohort, and various distributional assumptions have little bearing on the magnitude or standard errors of estimated causal associations.

J	McCandless, LC; Gustafson, P				McCandless, Lawrence C.; Gustafson, Paul			A comparison of Bayesian and Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Bayesian analysis; causal inference; non-identifiable model; sensitivity analysis	OBSERVATIONAL DATA; BIAS; BOUNDS; MODELS; RISK	Bias from unmeasured confounding is a persistent concern in observational studies, and sensitivity analysis has been proposed as a solution. In the recent years, probabilistic sensitivity analysis using either Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis (MCSA) or Bayesian sensitivity analysis (BSA) has emerged as a practical analytic strategy when there are multiple bias parameters inputs. BSA uses Bayes theorem to formally combine evidence from the prior distribution and the data. In contrast, MCSA samples bias parameters directly from the prior distribution. Intuitively, one would think that BSA and MCSA ought to give similar results. Both methods use similar models and the same (prior) probability distributions for the bias parameters. In this paper, we illustrate the surprising finding that BSA and MCSA can give very different results. Specifically, we demonstrate that MCSA can give inaccurate uncertainty assessments (e.g. 95% intervals) that do not reflect the data's influence on uncertainty about unmeasured confounding. Using a data example from epidemiology and simulation studies, we show that certain combinations of data and prior distributions can result in dramatic prior-to-posterior changes in uncertainty about the bias parameters. This occurs because the application of Bayes theorem in a non-identifiable model can sometimes rule out certain patterns of unmeasured confounding that are not compatible with the data. Consequently, the MCSA approach may give 95% intervals that are either too wide or too narrow and that do not have 95% frequentist coverage probability. Based on our findings, we recommend that analysts use BSA for probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We provide novel identification conditions for the causal effect of a treatment in the presence of unmeasured confounding by leveraging a possibly invalid IV for which both the IV independence and exclusion restriction assumptions may be violated. The proposed Mendelian randomization mixed-scale treatment effect robust identification (MR MiSTERI) approach relies on (i) an assumption that the treatment effect does not vary with the possibly invalid IV on the additive scale; (ii) that the confounding bias does not vary with the possibly invalid IV on the odds ratio scale; and (iii) that the residual variance for the outcome is heteroskedastic with respect to the possibly invalid IV. Although assumptions (i) and (ii) have, respectively, appeared in the IV literature, assumption (iii) has not; we formally establish that their conjunction can identify a causal effect even with an invalid IV. MR MiSTERI is shown to be particularly advantageous in the presence of pervasive heterogeneity of pleiotropic effects on the additive scale. We propose a simple and consistent three-stage estimator that can be used as a preliminary estimator to a carefully constructed efficient one-step-update estimator. In order to incorporate multiple, possibly correlated, and weak invalid IVs, a common challenge in MR studies, we develop a MAny Weak Invalid Instruments (MR MaWII MiSTERI) approach for strengthened identification and improved estimation accuracy. Both simulation studies and UK Biobank data analysis results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed methods.

To cope with the problem of possible confounding in these studies, investigators need methods for analyzing their results which adjust for confounders and lead to unbiased estimation of the treatment effect. In this paper, the authors describe the main principles of three statistical methods for doing this. The first method is the classical approach of a multiple regression model including the effects of treatment and covariates. This considers the relation between prognostic factors and the outcome variable as a relevant criterion for adjustment. The second method is based on the propensity score, focusing on the relation between prognostic factors and treatment assignment. The third method is an ecologic approach using a grouped treatment variable, which may aid in avoiding confounding by indication. These approaches are applied to a partially randomized trial conducted in 720 German breast cancer patients between 1984 and 1997. The study had a comprehensive cohort study design that included recruitment of patients who had consented to participation but not to randomization because of a preference for one of the treatments. This design offers a unique opportunity to contrast results from the nonrandomized portion of a study with those for a randomized subcohort as a reference.

Using an instrumental variable to test for unmeasured confounding	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						instrumental variables; observational study; confounding; comparative effectiveness	TO-TREAT ANALYSIS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; TREATMENT-NONCOMPLIANCE; ACCELERATION; DELIVERY; OUTCOMES; MODELS; CARE	An important concern in an observational study is whether or not there is unmeasured confounding, that is, unmeasured ways in which the treatment and control groups differ before treatment, which affect the outcome. We develop a test of whether there is unmeasured confounding when an instrumental variable (IV) is available. An IV is a variable that is independent of the unmeasured confounding and encourages a subject to take one treatment level versus another, while having no effect on the outcome beyond its encouragement of a certain treatment level. We show what types of unmeasured confounding can be tested for with an IV and develop a test for this type of unmeasured confounding that has correct type I error rate. We show that the widely used Durbin-Wu-Hausman test can have inflated type I error rates when there is treatment effect heterogeneity. Additionally, we show that our test provides more insight into the nature of the unmeasured confounding than the Durbin-Wu-Hausman test. We apply our test to an observational study of the effect of a premature infant being delivered in a high-level neonatal intensive care unit (one with mechanical assisted ventilation and high volume) versus a lower level unit, using the excess travel time a mother lives from the nearest high-level unit to the nearest lower-level unit as an IV.

Bayesian semi-parametric G-computation for causal inference in a cohort study with MNAR dropout and death	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						BART; cognitive ageing; longitudinal data; observational data; non&#8208; ignorable missing; sensitivity analysis; survivor average causal effect; time&#8208; varying exposure; time&#8208; varying confounding	PRINCIPAL STRATIFICATION; LONGITUDINAL DATA; OUTCOMES; MODELS; TRUNCATION; MEMORY; BART	Causal inference with observational longitudinal data and time-varying exposures is often complicated by time-dependent confounding and attrition. The G-computation formula is one approach for estimating a causal effect in this setting. The parametric modelling approach typically used in practice relies on strong modelling assumptions for valid inference and moreover depends on an assumption of missing at random, which is not appropriate when the missingness is missing not at random (MNAR) or due to death. In this work we develop a flexible Bayesian semi-parametric G-computation approach for assessing the causal effect on the subpopulation that would survive irrespective of exposure, in a setting with MNAR dropout. The approach is to specify models for the observed data using Bayesian additive regression trees, and then, use assumptions with embedded sensitivity parameters to identify and estimate the causal effect. The proposed approach is motivated by a longitudinal cohort study on cognition, health and ageing and we apply our approach to study the effect of becoming a widow on memory. We also compare our approach to several standard methods.

'Mendelian randomization' equals instrumental variable analysis with genetic instruments	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Mendelian randomization; instrumental variables; endogenous variables; self-selection; confounding	IDENTIFICATION	Interest in instrumental variable (IV) analyses using genetic instruments has been growing over the past 4 years. The background, strength and weaknesses of this approach, which in the epidemiology literature has been referred to as 'Mendelian randomization', has been recently reviewed by Lawlor et al. (Statist. Med. 2007. DOI: 10.1002/sim.3034). We suggest a change in the nomenclature of 'Mendelian randomization' and discuss issues relevant to IV analysis including instrument validation, motivation of IV analysis and interpretation of IV estimates in order to motivate a more consistent and standard use of IV analysis across applications using genetic instruments.

Robins (1998) established the identification of marginal structural model parameters under a sequential randomization assumption, which rules out unmeasured confounding of treatment assignment over time. The marginal structural Cox model is one of the most popular marginal structural models for evaluating the causal effect of timevarying treatments on a censored failure time outcome. In this paper, we establish sufficient conditions for identification of marginal structural Cox model parameters with the aid of a timevarying instrumental variable, in the case where sequential randomization fails to hold due to unmeasured confounding. Our instrumental variable identification condition rules out any interaction between an unmeasured confounder and the instrumental variable in its additive effects on the treatment process, the longitudinal generalization of the identifying condition of Wang & Tchetgen Tchetgen (2018). We describe a large class of weighted estimating equations that give rise to consistent and asymptotically normal estimators of the marginal structural Cox model, thereby extending the standard inverse probability of treatment weighted estimation of marginal structural models to the instrumental variable setting. Our approach is illustrated via extensive simulation studies and an application to estimating the effect of community antiretroviral therapy coverage on HIV incidence.

Evolving Statistical Methods to Facilitate Evaluation of the Causal Association Between Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agent Dose and Mortality in Nonexperimental Research: Strengths and Limitations	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF KIDNEY DISEASES			English	Review						Erythropoietin; hemodialysis; mortality; confounding by indication; statistical methods	HEMOGLOBIN LEVEL VARIABILITY; MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; CHRONIC KIDNEY-DISEASE; C-REACTIVE PROTEIN; HEMODIALYSIS-PATIENTS; EPOETIN-ALPHA; VASCULAR ACCESS; PREDICTORS; VARIABLES; SURVIVAL	Findings from randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy of therapy with erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) to normalize hemoglobin levels in patients with chronic kidney disease or kidney failure have raised questions regarding the safety of this class of drugs. However, no trial to date has specifically assessed the safety of ESA-dosing algorithms used to achieve the lower hemoglobin targets typically using in clinical practice. Although a wealth of nonexperimental data is available for dialysis patients, analyses based on these data are more susceptible to confounding bias than randomized controlled trials. Conducting valid pharmacoepidemiologic studies of drug effects in hemodialysis patients is complicated by the extent of their comorbidities, frequent hospitalizations, various concomitant medications, and an exceedingly high mortality rate. The need for greater ESA doses for the treatment of anemia in sicker patients potentially and plausibly generates confounding by indication, the control of which is complicated by the presence of time-dependent confounding. Here, we describe sources of bias in nonexperimental studies of ESA therapy in hemodialysis patients and critically appraise analytical methods that may help minimize bias in such studies.

Standardization typically reweights the stratum-specific rates so that exposure categories become comparable. With the development first of loglinear models, soon also of nonlinear regression techniques (logistic regression, failure time regression) that the emerging computers could handle, regression modelling became the preferred approach, just as was already the case with multiple regression analysis for continuous outcomes. Since the mid 1990s it has become increasingly obvious that weighting methods are still often useful, sometimes even necessary. On this background we aim at describing the emergence of the modelling approach and the refinement of the weighting approach for confounder control.

Safety surveillance and the estimation of risk in select populations: Flexible methods to control for confounding while targeting marginal comparisons via standardization	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						causal inference; electronic health records; pharmacosurveillance; propensity score; rare adverse event	PROPENSITY SCORE METHODS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; ASYMPTOTIC VARIANCE; PERFORMANCE; MODELS	We consider the critical problem of pharmacosurveillance for adverse events once a drug or medical product is incorporated into routine clinical care. When making inference on comparative safety using large-scale electronic health records, we often encounter an extremely rare binary adverse outcome with a large number of potential confounders. In this context, it is challenging to offer flexible methods to adjust for high-dimensional confounders, whereas use of the propensity score (PS) can help address this challenge by providing both confounding control and dimension reduction. Among PS methods, regression adjustment using the PS as a covariate in an outcome model has been incompletely studied and potentially misused. Previous studies have suggested that simple linear adjustment may not provide sufficient control of confounding. Moreover, no formal representation of the statistical procedure and associated inference has been detailed. In this paper, we characterize a three-step procedure, which performs flexible regression adjustment of the estimated PS followed by standardization to estimate the causal effect in a select population. We also propose a simple variance estimation method for performing inference. Through a realistic simulation mimicking data from the Food and Drugs Administration's Sentinel Initiative comparing the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers on incidence of angioedema, we show that flexible regression on the PS resulted in less bias without loss of efficiency, and can outperform other methods when the PS model is correctly specified. In addition, the direct variance estimation method is a computationally fast and reliable approach for inference.

Marginal structural models (MSMs), estimated using inverse probability of treatment weighting or the g-formula, are popular for handling this problem. With increasing development of advanced causal inference methods, it is important to be able to assess their performance in different scenarios to guide their application. Simulation studies are a key tool for this, but their use to evaluate causal inference methods has been limited. This paper focuses on the use of simulations for evaluations involving MSMs in studies with a time-to-event outcome. In a simulation, it is important to be able to generate the data in such a way that the correct forms of any models to be fitted to those data are known. However, this is not straightforward in the longitudinal setting because it is natural for data to be generated in a sequential conditional manner, whereas MSMs involve fitting marginal rather than conditional hazard models. We provide general results that enable the form of the correctly specified MSM to be derived based on a conditional data generating procedure, and show how the results can be applied when the conditional hazard model is an Aalen additive hazard or Cox model. Using conditional additive hazard models is advantageous because they imply additive MSMs that can be fitted using standard software. We describe and illustrate a simulation algorithm.

Noncollapsibility and its role in quantifying confounding bias in logistic regression	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Logistic regression; Confounding; Noncollapsibility; Confounder-adjustment; Univariable regression analysis; Multivariable regression analysis; Inverse probability weighting; Conditional effect; Marginal effect	PROPENSITY SCORE METHODS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; COLLAPSIBILITY; LOGIT; PROBIT; MODELS	BackgroundConfounding bias is a common concern in epidemiological research. Its presence is often determined by comparing exposure effects between univariable- and multivariable regression models, using an arbitrary threshold of a 10% difference to indicate confounding bias. However, many clinical researchers are not aware that the use of this change-in-estimate criterion may lead to wrong conclusions when applied to logistic regression coefficients. This is due to a statistical phenomenon called noncollapsibility, which manifests itself in logistic regression models. This paper aims to clarify the role of noncollapsibility in logistic regression and to provide guidance in determining the presence of confounding bias.MethodsA Monte Carlo simulation study was designed to uncover patterns of confounding bias and noncollapsibility effects in logistic regression. An empirical data example was used to illustrate the inability of the change-in-estimate criterion to distinguish confounding bias from noncollapsibility effects.ResultsThe simulation study showed that, depending on the sign and magnitude of the confounding bias and the noncollapsibility effect, the difference between the effect estimates from univariable- and multivariable regression models may underestimate or overestimate the magnitude of the confounding bias. Because of the noncollapsibility effect, multivariable regression analysis and inverse probability weighting provided different but valid estimates of the confounder-adjusted exposure effect. In our data example, confounding bias was underestimated by the change in estimate due to the presence of a noncollapsibility effect.ConclusionIn logistic regression, the difference between the univariable- and multivariable effect estimate might not only reflect confounding bias but also a noncollapsibility effect. Ideally, the set of confounders is determined at the study design phase and based on subject matter knowledge. To quantify confounding bias, one could compare the unadjusted exposure effect estimate and the estimate from an inverse probability weighted model.	[Schuster, Noah A.; Twisk, Jos W.

Acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder: A causal association or bias?	PAEDIATRIC AND PERINATAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						acetaminophen; ADHD; bias; confounding; pregnancy	DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; MEDICATION USE; PARACETAMOL; CHILDHOOD; RECALL; FEVER; WOMEN; ADHD	Background The association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the development of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in the offspring may be due to bias. Objectives The primary objective was to assess the role of potential unmeasured confounding in the estimation of the association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of ADHD, through bias analysis. The secondary objective was to assess the roles of selection bias and exposure misclassification. Data sources We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library up to December 2018. Study selection and data extraction We included observational studies examining the association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and the risk of ADHD. Synthesis We meta-analysed data across studies, using random-effects model. We conducted a bias analysis to studies that did not adjust for important confounders, to explore systematic errors related to unmeasured confounding, selection bias, and exposure misclassification. Results The search resulted in seven studies included in our meta-analysis. When adjusted estimates were pooled across all studies, the risk ratio (RR) for ADHD was 1.35 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25, 1.46; I-2 = 48%). Sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding in this meta-analysis showed that a confounder of 1.69 on the RR scale would reduce to 10% the proportion of studies with a true effect size of RR >1.10. Unmeasured confounding bias analysis decreased the point estimate in five of the seven studies and increased in two studies, suggesting that the observed association could be confounded by parental ADHD. Unadjusted and bias-corrected risk ratios (bcRRs) were: RR = 1.34, bcRR = 1.13; RR = 1.51, bcRR = 1.17; RR = 1.63, bcRR = 1.38; RR = 1.44, bcRR = 1.17; RR = 1.16, bcRR = 1.18; RR = 1.25, bcRR = 1.05; and RR = 0.99, bcRR = 1.18. Conclusions Bias analysis suggests that the previously reported association between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and an increased risk of ADHD in the offspring may be due to unmeasured confounding. Our ability to conclude a causal association is limited.

We demonstrate how prior knowledge unique to the multi-outcome setting can be leveraged to strengthen causal conclusions beyond what can be achieved from analyzing individual outcomes in isolation. We argue that it is often reasonable to make a shared confounding assumption, under which residual dependence amongst outcomes can be used to simplify and sharpen sensitivity analyses. We focus on a class of factor models for which we can bound the causal effects for all outcomes conditional on a single sensitivity parameter that represents the fraction of treatment variance explained by unobserved confounders. We characterize how causal ignorance regions shrink under additional prior assumptions about the presence of null control outcomes, and provide new approaches for quantifying the robustness of causal effect estimates. Finally, we illustrate our sensitivity analysis workflow in practice, in an analysis of both simulated data and a case study with data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

In recent reviews, evidence from epidemiologic studies has played a key role. Epidemiologic studies often provide evidence for effects of several air pollutants. Determining whether there are independent effects of the separate pollutants is a challenge. Among the many issues confronting the interpretation of epidemiologic studies of multi-pollutant exposures and health effects are those specifically related to statistical modeling. The EPA convened a workshop on 13 and 14 December 2006 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA, to discuss these and other issues; Session Three of the workshop was devoted specifically to statistical modeling. Prominent statistical modeling issues in epidemiologic studies of air pollution include (1) measurement error across the co-pollutants; (2) correlation and multi-collinearity among the co-pollutants; (3) the timing of the concentration-response function; (4) confounding; and (5) spatial analyses. The views expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily respect the views of policies of the US Environmental Protection Agency.

For example, a table might show odds ratios for one or more exposures and also for several confounders from a single logistic regression. This can lead to mistaken interpretations of these estimates. We use causal diagrams to display the sources of the problems. Presentation of exposure and confounder effect estimates from a single model may lead to several interpretative difficulties, inviting confusion of direct-effect estimates with total-effect estimates for covariates in the model. These effect estimates may also be confounded even though the effect estimate for the main exposure is not confounded. Interpretation of these effect estimates is further complicated by heterogeneity (variation, modification) of the exposure effect measure across covariate levels. We offer suggestions to limit potential misunderstandings when multiple effect estimates are presented, including precise distinction between total and direct effect measures from a single model, and use of multiple models tailored to yield total-effect estimates for covariates.

When there are time-varying confounders, which may include past outcomes, affected by prior exposure, standard regression methods can lead to bias. Methods such as inverse probability weighted estimation of marginal structural models have been developed to address this problem. However, in this paper we show how standard regression methods can be used, even in the presence of time-dependent confounding, to estimate the total effect of an exposure on a subsequent outcome by controlling appropriately for prior exposures, outcomes, and time-varying covariates. We refer to the resulting estimation approach as sequential conditional mean models (SCMMs), which can be fitted using generalized estimating equations. We outline this approach and describe how including propensity score adjustment is advantageous. We compare the causal effects being estimated using SCMMs and marginal structural models, and we compare the two approaches using simulations. SCMMs enable more precise inferences, with greater robustness against model misspecification via propensity score adjustment, and easily accommodate continuous exposures and interactions. A new test for direct effects of past exposures on a subsequent outcome is described.

J	Granger, E; Watkins, T; Sergeant, JC; Lunt, M				Granger, Emily; Watkins, Tim; Sergeant, Jamie C.; Lunt, Mark			A review of the use of propensity score diagnostics in papers published in high-ranking medical journals	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Review						Covariate balance; Confounding; Propensity scores; Diagnostics; Epidemiology	BALANCE; SELECTION; MODEL; BIAS; PRINCIPLES	Background Propensity scores are widely used to deal with confounding bias in medical research. An incorrectly specified propensity score model may lead to residual confounding bias; therefore it is essential to use diagnostics to assess propensity scores in a propensity score analysis. The current use of propensity score diagnostics in the medical literature is unknown. The objectives of this study are to (1) assess the use of propensity score diagnostics in medical studies published in high-ranking journals, and (2) assess whether the use of propensity score diagnostics differs between studies (a) in different research areas and (b) using different propensity score methods. Methods A PubMed search identified studies published in high-impact journals between Jan 1st 2014 and Dec 31st 2016 using propensity scores to answer an applied medical question. From each study we extracted information regarding how propensity scores were assessed and which propensity score method was used. Research area was defined using the journal categories from the Journal Citations Report. Results A total of 894 papers were included in the review. Of these, 187 (20.9%) failed to report whether the propensity score had been assessed. Commonly reported diagnostics were p-values from hypothesis tests (36.6%) and the standardised mean difference (34.6%). Statistical tests provided marginally stronger evidence for a difference in diagnostic use between studies in different research areas (p = 0.033) than studies using different propensity score methods (p = 0.061). Conclusions The use of diagnostics in the propensity score medical literature is far from optimal, with different diagnostics preferred in different areas of medicine. The propensity score literature may improve with focused efforts to change practice in areas where suboptimal practice is most common.

J	Park, S; Kang, S; Lee, C; Ma, S				Park, Soojin; Kang, Suyeon; Lee, Chioun; Ma, Shujie			Sensitivity analysis for causal decomposition analysis: Assessing robustness toward omitted variable bias	JOURNAL OF CAUSAL INFERENCE			English	Article						interventional indirect effect; unobserved confounding; disparity reduction; disparity remaining; robustness value	HEALTH; IDENTIFICATION	A key objective of decomposition analysis is to identify a factor (the "mediator") contributing to disparities in an outcome between social groups. In decomposition analysis, a scholarly interest often centers on estimating how much the disparity (e.g., health disparities between Black women and White men) would be reduced/remain if we set the mediator (e.g., education) distribution of one social group equal to another. However, causally identifying disparity reduction and remaining depends on the no omitted mediator-outcome confounding assumption, which is not empirically testable. Therefore, we propose a set of sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of disparity reduction to possible unobserved confounding. We derived general bias formulas for disparity reduction, which can be used beyond a particular statistical model and do not require any functional assumptions. Moreover, the same bias formulas apply with unobserved confounding measured before and after the group status. On the basis of the formulas, we provide sensitivity analysis techniques based on regression coefficients and R-2 values by extending the existing approaches. The R-2-based sensitivity analysis offers a straightforward interpretation of sensitivity parameters and a standard way to report the robustness of research findings. Although we introduce sensitivity analysis techniques in the context of decomposition analysis, they can be utilized in any mediation setting based on interventional indirect effects when the exposure is randomized (or conditionally ignorable given covariates).

J	Yanovitzky, I; Zanutto, E; Hornik, R				Yanovitzky, I; Zanutto, E; Hornik, R			Estimating causal effects of public health education campaigns using propensity score methodology	EVALUATION AND PROGRAM PLANNING			English	Article							BIAS	Many evaluations of public health education campaigns attempt to draw conclusions regarding the effect of messages on audiences' attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors based on observational data. To make causal inferences in these instances, it is necessary to adjust estimated campaign effects for possible selection bias due to systematic differences between respondents exposed to the campaign and those that were not. In particular, it is necessary to adjust for the impact of confounding variables that are likely to be determinants of both campaign exposure and outcomes. In comparison to other available methods for adjusting for selection bias such as multiple regression and instrumental variable methods, propensity scores offer a particularly simple way of adjusting estimates of campaign exposure effects for selection bias. This paper discusses the logic of this approach and illustrates its application to the evaluation of the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In observational studies, however, any detected association between treatment ("on-medication" vs "off-medication") and the outcome (performance in the activity) might be due to confounders. In particular, causal inferences at the personalized level are especially vulnerable to confounding effects that arise in a cyclic fashion. For quick acting medications, effects can be confounded by circadian rhythms and daily routines. Using the time-of-the-day as a surrogate for these confounders and the performance measurements as captured on a smartphone, we propose a personalized statistical approach to disentangle putative treatment and "time-of-the-day" effects, that leverages conditional independence relations spanned by causal graphical models involving the treatment, time-of-the-day, and outcome variables. Our approach is based on conditional independence tests implemented via standard and temporal linear regression models. Using synthetic data, we investigate when and how residual autocorrelation can affect the standard tests, and how time series modeling (namely, ARIMA and robust regression via HAC covariance matrix estimators) can remedy these issues. In particular, our simulations illustrate that when patients perform their activities in a paired fashion, positive autocorrelation can lead to conservative results for the standard regression approach (i.e., lead to deflated true positive detection), whereas negative autocorrelation can lead to anticonservative behavior (i.e., lead to inflated false positive detection). The adoption of time series methods, on the other hand, leads to well controlled type I error rates. We illustrate the application of our methodology with data from a Parkinson's disease mobile health study.

These methods are also known as "robustness or sensitivity analyses". A series of recent works (Frank [2000, Sociological Methods and Research 29: 147-194]; Pan and Frank [2003, Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics 28: 315- 337]; Frank and Min [2007, Sociological Methodology 37: 349-392]; and Frank et al. [2013, Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis 35: 437-460]) on robustness analysis extends earlier methods. We implement these recent developments in Stata. In particular, we provide commands to quantify the percent bias necessary to invalidate an inference from a Rubin causal model framework and the robustness of causal inferences in terms of correlations associated with unobserved variables.

J	Jackson, JW				Jackson, John W.			Diagnostics for Confounding of Time-varying and Other Joint Exposures	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; SELECTION BIAS; DIAGRAMS; OUTCOMES; WEIGHTS	The effects of joint exposures (or exposure regimes) include those of adhering to assigned treatment versus placebo in a randomized controlled trial, duration of exposure in a cohort study, interactions between exposures, and direct effects of exposure, among others. Unlike the setting of a single point exposure (e.g., propensity score matching), there are few tools to describe confounding for joint exposures or how well a method resolves it. Investigators need tools that describe confounding in ways that are conceptually grounded and intuitive for those who read, review, and use applied research to guide policy. We revisit the implications of exchangeability conditions that hold in sequentially randomized trials, and the bias structure that motivates the use of g-methods, such as marginal structural models. From these, we develop covariate balance diagnostics for joint exposures that can (1) describe time-varying confounding, (2) assess whether covariates are predicted by prior exposures given their past, the indication for g-methods, and (3) describe residual confounding after inverse probability weighting. For each diagnostic, we present time-specific metrics that encompass a wide class of joint exposures, including regimes of multivariate time-varying exposures in censored data, with multivariate point exposures as a special case. We outline how to estimate these directly or with regression and how to average them over person-time. Using a simulated example, we show how these metrics can be presented graphically. This conceptually grounded framework can potentially aid the transparent design, analysis, and reporting of studies that examine joint exposures. We provide easy-to-use tools to implement it.

To examine causal effects, it is important to evaluate what-if scenarios-the so-called "counterfactuals." We propose a novel deep learning architecture for propensity score matching and counterfactual prediction-the deep propensity network using a sparse autoencoder (DPN-SA)-to tackle the problems of high dimensionality, nonlinear/nonparallel treatment assignment, and residual confounding when estimating treatment effects. Materials and Methods: We used 2 randomized prospective datasets, a semisynthetic one with nonlinear/nonparallel treatment selection bias and simulated counterfactual outcomes from the Infant Health and Development Program and a real-world dataset from the LaLonde's employment training program. We compared different configurations of the DPN-SA against logistic regression and LASSO as well as deep counterfactual networks with propensity dropout (DCN-PD). Models' performances were assessed in terms of average treatment effects, mean squared error in precision on effect's heterogeneity, and average treatment effect on the treated, over multiple training/test runs. Results: The DPN-SA outperformed logistic regression and LASSO by 36%-63%, and DCN-PD by 6%-10% across all datasets. All deep learning architectures yielded average treatment effects close to the true ones with low variance. Results were also robust to noise-injection and addition of correlated variables. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/Shantanu48114860/DPN-SAz. Discussion and Conclusion: Deep sparse autoencoders are particularly suited for treatment effect estimation studies using electronic health records because they can handle high-dimensional covariate sets, large sample sizes, and complex heterogeneity in treatment assignments.

A number of different mediation approaches have been presented in the biomedical, social science and statistical literature with an emphasis on different aspects of mediation. We review the different sets of assumptions that allow identification and estimation of effects in the simple case of a single intervention, a temporally subsequent mediator and outcome. These assumptions include various no confounding assumptions including sequential ignorability assumptions and also interaction assumptions involving the treatment and mediator. The understanding of such assumptions is crucial since some can be assessed under certain conditions (e.g. treatment-mediator interactions), whereas others cannot (sequential ignorability). These issues become more complex with multiple mediators and longitudinal outcomes. In addressing these assumptions, we review several causal approaches to mediation analyses.

This work is motivated by an interest in determining the causal impact of directly observed therapy on the successful treatment of Tuberculosis. We focus on propensity score regression and covariate adjustment to balance the treatment allocation. We discuss the need to include latent local-level random effects in the propensity score model to reduce bias in the estimation of causal effects. A simulation study suggests that accounting for the multilevel nature of the data with latent structures in both the outcome and propensity score models has the potential to reduce bias in the estimation of causal effects.

J	Wan, F; Small, D; Bekelman, JE; Mitra, N				Wan, Fei; Small, Dylan; Bekelman, Justin E.; Mitra, Nandita			Bias in estimating the causal hazard ratio when using two-stage instrumental variable methods	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						instrumental variable; two-stage residual inclusion; two-stage predictor substitution; unmeasured confounding; survival; bias	ADVANCED PROSTATE-CANCER; ANDROGEN-DEPRIVATION THERAPY; INFERENCE; MODELS; IDENTIFICATION; NONCOMPLIANCE; RADIOTHERAPY; TRIAL	Two-stage instrumental variable methods are commonly used to estimate the causal effects of treatments on survival in the presence of measured and unmeasured confounding. Two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI) has been the method of choice over two-stage predictor substitution (2SPS) in clinical studies. We directly compare the bias in the causal hazard ratio estimated by these two methods. Under a principal stratification framework, we derive a closed-form solution for asymptotic bias of the causal hazard ratio among compliers for both the 2SPS and 2SRI methods when survival time follows the Weibull distribution with random censoring. When there is no unmeasured confounding and no always takers, our analytic results show that 2SRI is generally asymptotically unbiased, but 2SPS is not. However, when there is substantial unmeasured confounding, 2SPS performs better than 2SRI with respect to bias under certain scenarios. We use extensive simulation studies to confirm the analytic results from our closed-form solutions. We apply these two methods to prostate cancer treatment data from Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare and compare these 2SRI and 2SPS estimates with results from two published randomized trials.

The Importance of Scale for Spatial-Confounding Bias and Precision of Spatial Regression Estimators	STATISTICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Epidemiology; identifiability; mixed model; penalized likelihood; random effects; spatial correlation; splines	COMMUNITY AIR-POLLUTION; TIME-SERIES; MORTALITY; MODELS; DISEASE; EXPOSURE; HEALTH; COHORT	Residuals in regression models are often spatially correlated. Prominent examples include studies in environmental epidemiology to understand the chronic health effects of pollutants. I consider the effects of residual spatial structure on the bias and precision of regression coefficients, developing a simple framework in which to understand the key issues and derive informative analytic results. When unmeasured confounding introduces spatial structure into the residuals, regression models with spatial random effects and closely-related models such as kriging and penalized splines are biased, even when the residual variance components are known. Analytic and simulation results show how the bias depends on the spatial scales of the covariate and the residual: one can reduce bias by fitting a spatial model only when there is variation in the covariate at a scale smaller than the scale of the unmeasured confounding. I also discuss how the scales of the residual and the covariate affect efficiency and uncertainty estimation when the residuals are independent of the covariate. In an application on the association between black carbon particulate matter air pollution and birth weight, controlling for large-scale spatial variation appears to reduce bias from unmeasured confounders, while increasing uncertainty in the estimated pollution effect.

It is unclear whether different methods produce similar results for estimates of radiation risk when applied to the same data. The goal of this study was to compare the radiation risk estimates for leukemia other than chronic lymphocytic leukemia (non-CLL) and ischemic heart disease (IHD) produced by both Cox and Poisson regression models for time-dependent dose-response analyses of occupational exposure. Materials and methods For brevity, this methods paper presents the results from one cohort, the Nuclear Power Plant workers (NPP), though the evaluation considered five cohorts of varying size and exposure as part of the Million Worker Study. Cox Proportional Hazards models, with age as the underlying timescale for hazard, were conducted using three computer software programs: SAS, R, and Epicure. Doses lagged 2 years for non-CLL and 10 years for ischemic heart disease were treated as time-dependent exposures at the annual level and were examined both in categories and as a continuous term. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported for each model in SAS and R, while the Peanuts program of Epicure was utilized to produce Excess Relative Risk (ERR) estimates and 95% CI. All models were adjusted for gender and year of birth. Four piece-wise exponential Poisson models (log-linear regression for rate) were developed with varying cutpoints for age strata from very fine to broad categories using both R and the Amfit program in Epicure for ERR estimates. Results Comparable estimates of risk (both RR and ERR) were observed from Cox and Poisson models, regardless of software utilized, as long as appropriately narrow categories of age were utilized to control the confounding of age in Poisson models. The ERR estimates produced in Epicure tended to agree very closely with the HR or RR estimates, and the statistical software program used had no impact to risk estimates for the same model. Conclusions As computational power is no longer the burden today as it has been in the past, the results of this evaluation support the use of the Cox proportional hazards or the ungrouped Poisson approach to analyzing time-dependent dose-response relationships to ensure that maximum control over the confounding of age is achieved in studies of mortality for cohorts occupationally exposed to radiation.

However, existing analytic methods of dietary data are often sub-optimal, with limited incorporation and analysis of the correlations between the studied variables and nonlinear behaviours in the data. Machine learning (ML) is an area of artificial intelligence that has the potential to improve modelling of nonlinear associations and confounding which are found in nutritional data. These opportunities notwithstanding, the applications of ML in nutritional epidemiology must be approached cautiously to safeguard the scientific quality of the results and provide accurate interpretations. Given the complex scenario around ML, judicious application of such tools is necessary to offer nutritional epidemiology a novel analytical resource for dietary measurement and assessment and a tool to model the complexity of dietary intake and its relation to health. This work describes the applications of ML in nutritional epidemiology and provides guidelines to avoid common pitfalls encountered in applying predictive statistical models to nutritional data. Furthermore, it helps unfamiliar readers better assess the significance of their results and provides new possible future directions in the field of ML in nutritional epidemiology.

Doubly robust estimators of causal exposure effects with missing data in the outcome, exposure or a confounder	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	32nd Annual Conference of the International-Society-for-Clinical-Biostatistics	AUG 21-25, 2011	Ontario, CANADA			double-robustness; inverse probability weighting; G-computation; confounding; missing data; observational study	PROPENSITY SCORE; MULTIPLE IMPUTATION; REGRESSION-MODELS; G-COMPUTATION; INFERENCE; EFFICIENCY	We consider the estimation of the causal effect of a binary exposure on a continuous outcome. Confounding and missing data are both likely to occur in practice when observational data are used to estimate this causal effect. In dealing with each of these problems, model misspecification is likely to introduce bias. We present augmented inverse probability weighted (AIPW) estimators that account for both confounding and missing data, with the latter occurring in a single variable only. These estimators have an element of robustness to misspecification of the models used. Our estimators require two models to be specified to deal with confounding and two to deal with missing data. Only one of each of these models needs to be correctly specified. When either the outcome or the exposure of interest is missing, we derive explicit expressions for the AIPW estimator. When a confounder is missing, explicit derivation is complex, so we use a simple algorithm, which can be applied using standard statistical software, to obtain an approximation to the AIPW estimator.

Different ways of handling medication are required depending on the research questions and whether the affected measurement is the exposure, the outcome, or a confounder. This study aimed to review handling of medication use in observational research. Methods PubMed was searched for etiological studies published between 2015 and 2019 in 15 high-ranked journals from cardiology, diabetes, and epidemiology. We selected studies that analyzed blood pressure, glucose, or lipid measurements (whether exposure, outcome or confounder) by linear or logistic regression. Two reviewers independently recorded how medication use was handled and assessed whether the methods used were in accordance with the research aim. We reported the methods used per variable category (exposure, outcome, confounder). Results A total of 127 articles were included. Most studies did not perform any method to account for medication use (exposure 58%, outcome 53%, and confounder 45%). Restriction (exposure 22%, outcome 23%, and confounders 10%), or adjusting for medication use using a binary indicator were also used frequently (exposure: 18%, outcome: 19%, confounder: 45%). No advanced methods were applied. In 60% of studies, the methods' validity could not be judged due to ambiguous reporting of the research aim. Invalid approaches were used in 28% of the studies, mostly when the affected variable was the outcome (36%). Conclusion Many studies ambiguously stated the research aim and used invalid methods to handle medication use. Researchers should consider a valid methodological approach based on their research question.

Repair of Partly Misspecified Causal Diagrams	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							BACKGROUND KNOWLEDGE; INFERENCE; ALGORITHMS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; REGRESSION; SEARCH; MODELS	Errors in causal diagrams elicited from experts can lead to the omission of important confounding variables from adjustment sets and render causal inferences invalid. In this report, a novel method is presented that repairs a misspecified causal diagram through the addition of edges. These edges are determined using a data-driven approach designed to provide improved statistical efficiency relative to de novo structure learning methods. Our main assumption is that the expert is "directionally informed,''meaning that "false" edges provided by the expert would not create cycles if added to the "true" causal diagram. The overall procedure is cast as a preprocessing technique that is agnostic to subsequent causal inferences. Results based on simulated data and data derived from an observational cohort illustrate the potential for data-assisted elicitation in epidemiologic applications.

The ACDE is the component of the total exposure effect that is not relayed through the specified intermediate. Even if the total effect is unconfounded, the usual ACDE estimate may be biased when an unmeasured variable affects the intermediate and outcome variables. Using linear programming optimization to compute non-parametric bounds, we develop new ACDE estimators for binary measured variables in this causal structure, and use root mean square confounding bias (RMSB) to compare their performance with the usual stratified estimator in simulated distributions of target populations comprised of the 64 possible potential response types as well as distributions of target populations restricted to subsets of 18 or 12 potential response types defined by monotonicity or no-interactions assumptions of unit-level causal effects. We also consider target population distributions conditioned on fixed outcome risk among the unexposed, or fixed true ACDE in one stratum of the intermediate. Results show that a midpoint estimator constructed from the optimization bounds has consistently lower RMSB than the usual stratified estimator both unconditionally and conditioned on any risk in the unexposed. When conditioning on true ACDE, this midpoint estimator perfouns more poorly only when conditioned on an extreme true ACDE in one stratum of the intermediate, yet outperforms the stratified estimator in the other stratum when interaction is permitted. An alternate 'limit-modified crude' estimator can never perform less favourably than the stratified estimator, and often has lower RMSB. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Causation and familial confounding as explanations for the associations of polygenic risk scores with breast cancer: Evidence from innovative ICE FALCON and ICE CRISTAL analyses	GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						breast cancer; causation; familial confounding; family data; ICE CRISTAL; ICE FALCON; siblings	GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY; MAMMOGRAPHIC DENSITY; BOADICEA MODEL; WOMEN; AGE; INFERENCE; INSIGHTS; HISTORY; TWIN	A polygenic risk score (PRS) combines the associations of multiple genetic variants that could be due to direct causal effects, indirect genetic effects, or other sources of familial confounding. We have developed new approaches to assess evidence for and against causation by using family data for pairs of relatives (Inference about Causation from Examination of FAmiliaL CONfounding [ICE FALCON]) or measures of family history (Inference about Causation from Examining Changes in Regression coefficients and Innovative STatistical AnaLyses [ICE CRISTAL]). Inference is made from the changes in regression coefficients of relatives' PRSs or PRS and family history before and after adjusting for each other. We applied these approaches to two breast cancer PRSs and multiple studies and found that (a) for breast cancer diagnosed at a young age, for example, <50 years, there was no evidence that the PRSs were causal, while (b) for breast cancer diagnosed at later ages, there was consistent evidence for causation explaining increasing amounts of the PRS-disease association. The genetic variants in the PRS might be in linkage disequilibrium with truly causal variants and not causal themselves. These PRSs cause minimal heritability of breast cancer at younger ages. There is also evidence for nongenetic factors shared by first-degree relatives that explain breast cancer familial aggregation. Familial associations are not necessarily due to genes, and genetic associations are not necessarily causal.

Bayesian age-stratified joinpoint regression model: an application to lung and brain cancer mortality	JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						joinpoint regression; Bayesian statistics; mortality; lung cancer; brain cancer; SEER	SELECTION; VARIABLES; CHOICE; PRIORS; RATES	Joinpoint regression model identifies significant changes in the trends of the incidence, mortality, and survival of a specific disease in a given population. The purpose of the present study is to develop an age-stratified Bayesian joinpoint regression model to describe mortality trend assuming that the observed counts are probabilistically characterized by the Poisson distribution. The proposed model is based on Bayesian model selection criteria with the smallest number of joinpoints that are sufficient to explain the Annual Percentage Change. The prior probability distributions are chosen in such a way that they are automatically derived from the model index contained in the model space. The proposed model and methodology estimates the age-adjusted mortality rates in different epidemiological studies to compare the trends by accounting the confounding effects of age. In developing the subject methods, we use the cancer mortality counts of adult lung and bronchus cancer, and brain and other Central Nervous System cancer patients obtained from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results data base of the National Cancer Institute.

Model-based standardization using an outcome model with random effects	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						causal inference; confounding; generalized linear mixed models; marginal effect; model-based standardization	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; CLUSTER-SIZE	Model-based standardization uses a statistical outcome model or exposure model to estimate a population-average association that is unconfounded by selected covariates. With it, one can compare groups using a distribution of confounders identical in each group to that of a standard population. We develop an approach based on an outcome model, in which the mean of the outcome is modeled conditional on the exposure and the confounders. In our approach, there is a confounder that clusters the observations into a very large number of categories. We treat the parameters for the clusters as random effects. We use a between-within model to account for the association of the random effects not only with the exposure but also with the cluster population sizes. We review alternative approaches presented in the literature, and we compare the outcome-modeling approach to recently proposed exposure-modeling approaches incorporating random effects. To illustrate, we use 2014 to compare proportions of acute respiratory tract infection diagnoses with an antibiotic prescription for emergency department versus outpatient visits, adjusting for confounding by unmeasured patient level variables and measured diagnosis-level variables. We also present results of a simulation study.

In the presence of such covariates, standard approaches for adjustment for confounding are biased. The method of G-estimation allows for appropriate adjustment. Previous studies applying the G-estimation method have addressed effects on all-cause mortality rather than on specific causes of death. In the present study, a method to adjust for censoring by competing risks is presented, The authors used the approach to estimate the causal effect of isolated systolic hypertension on cardiovascular mortality in the Framingham Heart Study, with a 10-year follow-up using data from 1956 to 1970. Arterial rigidity is a major determinant of isolated systolic hypertension and may be a confounder of the relation between isolated systolic hypertension and cardiovascular death. Conversely, isolated systolic hypertension may by itself contribute to stiffening of the vessel wall, and arterial rigidity may therefore also be an intermediate variable in the causal pathway from isolated systolic hypertension to cardiovascular death. While controlling for arterial rigidity and other baseline and time-dependent covariates, isolated systolic hypertension decreased the time to cardiovascular death by 45% (95% confidence interval 3-69).

Here we show that using rich data on comorbidities and automatic variable selection strategies for selecting confounders can better control confounding within a case-control study design and provide a more solid basis for inference regarding the causal effects of drugs on HOIs. Four HOIs are examined: acute kidney injury, acute liver injury, acute myocardial infarction and gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. For each of these HOIs we use a previously published reference set of positive and negative control drugs to evaluate the performance of our methods. Our methods have AUCs that are often substantially higher than the AUCs of a baseline method that only uses demographic characteristics for confounding control. Our methods also give confidence intervals for causal effect parameters that cover the expected no effect value substantially more often than this baseline method. The case-control study design, unlike the self- controlled study design, can be used in the fairly typical setting of EHR databases without longitudinal information on patients. With our variable selection method, these databases can be more effectively used for the detection of ADRs.

This problem underlies much of neighborhoods research, which abounds with studies that consider associations between neighborhood characteristics and health outcomes in longitudinal data. Such analyses are confounded by selection issues; individuals with above average health outcomes (or associated characteristics) may self-select into advantaged neighborhoods. Techniques commonly used to assess causal inferences in observational longitudinal data, such as inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), may be inappropriate in neighborhoods data due to unique characteristics of such data. We advance the IPTW toolkit by introducing a procedure based on a multivariate kernel density function which is more appropriate for neighborhoods data. The proposed weighting method is applied in conjunction with a marginal structural model. Our empirical analyses use longitudinal data from the Health and Retirement Study; our exposure of interest is an index of neighborhood socioeconomic status (NSES), and we examine its influence on cognitive function. Our findings illustrate the importance of the choice of method for IPTW-the comparison weighting methods provide poor balance across the set of covariates (which is not the case for our preferred procedure) and yield misleading results when applied in the outcomes models. The utility of the multivariate kernel is also validated via simulation. In addition, our findings emphasize the importance of IPTW-controlling for covariates within a regression without IPTW indicates that NSES affects cognition, whereas IPTW-weighted models fail to show a statistically significant effect.

Spatial causal inference poses analytic challenges due to complex correlation structures and interference between the treatment at one location and the outcomes at others. In this paper, we review the current literature on spatial causal inference and identify areas of future work. We first discuss methods that exploit spatial structure to account for unmeasured confounding variables. We then discuss causal analysis in the presence of spatial interference including several common assumptions used to reduce the complexity of the interference patterns under consideration. These methods are extended to the spatiotemporal case where we compare and contrast the potential outcomes framework with Granger causality and to geostatistical analyses involving spatial random fields of treatments and responses. The methods are introduced in the context of observational environmental and epidemiological studies and are compared using both a simulation study and analysis of the effect of ambient air pollution on COVID-19 mortality rate. Code to implement many of the methods using the popular Bayesian software OpenBUGS is provided.

Marginal Structural Models: unbiased estimation for longitudinal studies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Bias; Confounding; Mediation; Longitudinal data; Marginal Structural Models; Inverse probability weighting	EPIDEMIOLOGY	In this article, we introduce Marginal Structural Models, which yield unbiased estimates of causal effects of exposures in the presence of time-varying confounding variables that also act as mediators. We describe estimation via inverse probability weighting; estimation may also be accomplished by g-computation (Robins in Latent Variable Modeling and Applications to Causality, Springer, New York, pp 69-117, 1997; van der Wal et al. in Stat Med 28:2325-2337, 2009) or targeted maximum likelihood (Rosenblum and van der Laan in Int J Biostat 6, 2010). When both time-varying confounding and mediation are present in a longitudinal setting data, Marginal Structural Models are a useful tool that provides unbiased estimates.	[Moodie, Erica E.

A longitudinal study of vaginal douching and bacterial vaginosis - A marginal structural modeling analysis	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						confounding factors (epidemiology); epidemiologic methods; longitudinal studies; models; structural; vaginal douching; vaginosis; bacterial	SEXUALLY-TRANSMITTED-DISEASES; MICROBIAL-FLORA; WOMEN DOUCHE; RISK; ASSOCIATIONS; PREVALENCE; SYMPTOMS; SEX; LACTOBACILLI; ACQUISITION	The etiology of bacterial vaginosis is unknown, and there are no long-term therapies for preventing this frequently recurring condition. Vaginal douching has been reported to be associated with bacterial vaginosis in observational studies. However, this association may be due to confounding by indication-that is, confounding by women douching in response to vaginal symptoms associated with bacterial vaginosis. The authors used marginal structural modeling to estimate the causal effect of douching on bacterial vaginosis risk while controlling for this confounding effect. In 1999-2002, nonpregnant women (n = 3,620) were recruited into a prospective study when they visited one of 12 public health clinics in Birmingham, Alabama, for routine care. Participants were assessed quarterly for 1 year. Bacterial vaginosis was based on a Nugent's Gram stain score of 7 or higher. Thirty-two percent of participants douched in every study interval, and 43.0% never douched. Of the 12,349 study visits, 40.2% were classified as involving bacterial vaginosis. The relative risk for regular douching as compared with no douching was 1.21 (95% confidence interval: 1.08, 1.38). These findings indicate that douching confers increased risk of disruption of vaginal flora. In the absence of a large randomized trial, these findings provide the best evidence to date for a risk of bacterial vaginosis associated with douching.

Explaining heterogeneity of individual treatment causal effects by subgroup discovery: An observational case study in antibiotics treatment of acute rhino-sinusitis	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Individual treatment causal effects; Heterogeneity of treatment effects; Subgroup discovery; Synthetic random forests; Prediction models; Observational studies; Antibiotics treatment; Acute rhino-sinusitis	IDENTIFICATION; GUIDELINES; REGRESSION; OUTCOMES	Objectives: Individuals may respond differently to the same treatment, and there is a need to understand such heterogeneity of causal individual treatment effects. We propose and evaluate a modelling approach to better understand this heterogeneity from observational studies by identifying patient subgroups with a markedly deviating response to treatment. We illustrate this approach in a primary care case-study of antibiotic (AB) prescription on recovery from acute rhino-sinusitis (ARS). Methods: Our approach consists of four stages and is applied to a large dataset in primary care dataset of 24,392 patients suspected of suffering from ARS. We first identify pre-treatment variables that either confound the relationship between treatment and outcome or are risk factors of the outcome. Second, based on the pretreatment variables we create Synthetic Random Forest (SRF) models to compute the potential outcomes and subsequently the causal individual treatment effect (ITE) estimates. Third, we perform subgroup discovery using the ITE estimates as outcomes to identify positive and negative responders. Fourth, we evaluate the predictive performance of the identified subgroups for predicting the outcome in two ways: the likelihood ratio test, and whether the subgroups are selected via the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) using backward stepwise variable selection. We validate the whole modelling strategy by means of 10-fold-cross-validation. Results: Based on 20 pre-treatment variables, four subgroups (three for positive responders and one for negative responders) were identified. The log likelihood ratio tests showed that the subgroups were significant. Variable selection using the AIC kept two of the four subgroups, one for positive responders and one for negative responders. As for the validation of the whole modelling strategy, all reported measures (the number of pretreatment variables associated with the outcome, number of subgroups, number of subgroups surviving variable selection and coverage) showed little variation. Conclusions: With the proposed approach, we identified subgroups of positive and negative responders to treatment that markedly deviate from the mean response. The subgroups showed additive predictive value of the outcome. The modelling approach strategy was shown to be robust on this dataset. Our approach was thus able to discover understandable subgroups from observational data that have predictive value and which may be considered by the clinical users to get insight into who responds positively or negatively to a proposed treatment.

Methods: The quality of included articles was assessed according to Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale and the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology. A random effects model was used to calculate pooled risk ratios and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), and publication bias was tested by Egger statistical test. Results: Eight studies were included finally. We found a crude positive association of prenatal antibiotics use during each pregnancy trimester and risk of childhood asthma or wheeze with RRs of 1.28 (95% CI, 1.09-1.51) for the first trimester of pregnancy, 1.25 (95% CI, 1.02-1.52) for the second trimester, and 1.25 (95% Cl, 1.05-1.49) for the third trimester. However, when considering potential factors of maternal infections and presence of siblings, the relationship for each trimester was insignificant. Conclusions: This systemic review and meta-analysis proposed a crude positive association between prenatal antibiotic use in every specific trimester and risk of childhood asthma or wheeze. However, adjustment for confounders decreased the relative risk estimates, supporting the concept that these associations are, at least in part, because of confounding by indication.

This article establishes an "orthogonal" score for learning treatment effects, using observational data with a potentially large number of confounders. The estimator allows for root-n, asymptotically valid confidence intervals, despite the bias induced by the regularization. Moreover, we develop a novel hazard difference (HDi), estimator. We establish rate double robustness through the cross-fitting formulation. Numerical experiments illustrate the finite sample performance, where we observe that the cross-fitted HDi estimator has the best performance. We study the radical prostatectomy's effect on conservative prostate cancer management through the SEER-Medicare linked data. Last, we provide an extension to machine learning both approaches and heterogeneous treatment effects. for this article are available online.

Borrowing from supplemental sources to estimate causal effects from a primary data source	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Bayesian additive regression trees; Bayesian linear model; Bayesian model averaging; borrowing; causal inference; multisource exchangeability models	PRIOR DISTRIBUTIONS; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; NICOTINE CONTENT; REGRESSION; CIGARETTES; SELECTION; EXPOSURE	The increasing multiplicity of data sources offers exciting possibilities in estimating the effects of a treatment, intervention, or exposure, particularly if observational and experimental sources could be used simultaneously. Borrowing between sources can potentially result in more efficient estimators, but it must be done in a principled manner to mitigate increased bias and Type I error. Furthermore, when the effect of treatment is confounded, as in observational sources or in clinical trials with noncompliance, causal effect estimators are needed to simultaneously adjust for confounding and to estimate effects across data sources. We consider the problem of estimating causal effects from a primary source and borrowing from any number of supplemental sources. We propose using regression-based estimators that borrow based on assuming exchangeability of the regression coefficients and parameters between data sources. Borrowing is accomplished with multisource exchangeability models and Bayesian model averaging. We show via simulation that a Bayesian linear model and Bayesian additive regression trees both have desirable properties and borrow under appropriate circumstances. We apply the estimators to recently completed trials of very low nicotine content cigarettes investigating their impact on smoking behavior.

Methods: Using five waves of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (2013-2019), we estimated marginal structural models with inverse probability of treatment and censoring weights to examine the association between time-varying e-cigarette initiation and subsequent cigarette smoking initiation among e-cigarette- and cigarette-naive youth (12-17 years) at baseline. Time-dependent confounders used as predictors in inverse probability weights included tobacco-related attitudes or beliefs, mental health symptoms, substance use, and tobacco-marketing exposure. Results: Among 9,584 youth at baseline, those who initiated e-cigarettes were 2.4 times as likely to subsequently initiate cigarette smoking as youth who did not initiate e-cigarettes (risk ratio - 2.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.1, 2.7), after accounting for timedependent confounding and selection bias. Among youth who initiated e-cigarettes, more frequent vaping was associated with greater risk of smoking initiation (risk ratio >= 3 days/month - 1.8, 95% CI = 1.4, 2.2; 1-2 days/month = 1.2; 95% CI = 0.93, 1.6 vs. 0 days/month). Weighted marginal structural model estimates were moderately attenuated compared with unweighted estimates adjusted for baseline-only confounders. At the US population level, we estimated over half a million youth initiated cigarette smoking because of prior e-cigarette use over follow-up. Conclusions: The association between youth vaping and combustible cigarette smoking persisted after accounting for time-dependent confounding. We estimate that e-cigarette use accounts for a considerable share of cigarette initiation among US youth. See video abstract at, http://links.lww.com/EDE/B937.

They are often reported as having low rates of birth intervention, however the precise impact is obscured because less disadvantaged mothers with less complex pregnancies, and who prefer and often select little intervention, are more likely to choose a birth centre. In this paper, we use a methodology that purges the impact of these selection effects and provides a causal interpretation of the impact of birth centres on intervention outcomes. Using administrative birth data on over 364,000 births in Australia's most populous state between 2001 and 2012, we implement an instrumental variables framework to address confounding factors influencing choice of birth setting. We find that giving birth in a birth centre results in significantly lower probabilities of intervention, and that critically, this impact has been increasing over time. Our estimates are larger than those in existing studies, reflecting our newer data, diverging intervention rates across birth settings, and our accounting for important selection effects. The results emphasise the greater role of birth centres in delivering on policy priorities which include greater maternal autonomy, lower intervention rates, and lower health system costs.

To assess causality requires either randomization or sophisticated methods applied to carefully designed observational studies. In most cases, randomized trials are not feasible in the context of root cause analysis. Using observational data for causal inference, however, presents many challenges in both the design and analysis stages. Methods for observational causal inference often fall outside the toolbox of even well-trained statisticians, thus necessitating workforce training. Methods: This article synthesizes the key concepts and statistical perspectives for causal inference, and describes available educational resources, with a focus on observational clinical data. The target audience for this review is clinical researchers with training in fundamental statistics or epidemiology, and statisticians collaborating with those researchers. Results: The available literature includes a number of textbooks and thousands of review articles. However, using this literature for independent study or clinical training programs is extremely challenging for numerous reasons. First, the published articles often assume an advanced technical background with different notations and terminology. Second, they may be written from any number of perspectives across statistics, epidemiology, computer science, or philosophy. Third, the methods are rapidly expanding and thus difficult to capture within traditional publications. Fourth, even the most fundamental aspects of causal inference (eg, framing the causal question as a target trial) often receive little or no coverage. This review presents an overview of (1) key concepts and frameworks for causal inference and (2) online documents that are publicly available for better assisting researchers to gain the necessary perspectives for functioning effectively within a multidisciplinary team. Conclusion: A familiarity with causal inference methods can help risk managers empirically verify, from observed events, the true causes of adverse sentinel events.

Proximal causal inference requires existence of solutions to at least one of two integral equations. We motivate the existence of solutions to the integral equations from proximal causal inference by demonstrating that, assuming the existence of a solution to one of the integral equations, root n-estimability of a linear functional (such as its mean) of that solution requires the existence of a solution to the other integral equation. Solutions to the integral equations may not be unique, which complicates estimation and inference. We construct a consistent estimator for the solution set for one of the integral equations and then adapt the theory of extremum estimators to find from the estimated set a consistent estimator for a uniquely defined solution. A debiased estimator for the counterfactual mean is shown to be root -n consistent, regular, and asymptotically semiparametrically locally efficient under additional regularity conditions.

The problem of assessing the adequacy of model fit when the expectations are small is addressed by analytical calculations and by simulation. The method is illustrated with data from the national register of childhood tumours. Design - The tumour data are recorded in a national register. Setting - England, Scotland, and Wales. Subjects - The cases considered are all children registered with leukaemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma under the age of 15 years between 1966-87. Main results - The methods show a significant variation of leukaemia incidence in relation to the Registrar General's standard region and a negative association with socioeconomic deprivation, as measured by the Townsend index. After allowing for these variables, the incidence seems to be reasonably homogeneous throughout the population, in the sense that the residual deviance does not seem to be much larger than would be expected by chance. Conclusions - The methods described have major advantages over standardisation in controlling for confounding, both in terms of flexibility of factor selection and assessment and also in the ability to determine whether there is residual variability of incidence after allowing for these factors.

The effect of confounding variables in studies of lead exposure and IQ	CRITICAL REVIEWS IN TOXICOLOGY			English	Review						Blood lead; IQ; pooled-analysis; confounding variables; covariates	LEVEL; INTELLIGENCE	Methods proposed to address confounding variables frequently do not adequately distinguish confounding from covariation. A confounder is a variable that correlates both with the outcome and the major exposure variable. Accurate treatment of confounding is crucial to low dose extrapolation of the effects of chemical exposures based on epidemiology studies. This study explores the limitations of current regression models in extrapolation to the low dose region of the dose-response curve due to the existence of unrecognized and uncontrolled confounding, using epidemiological data for lead. Based on the reported data in analyses by Lanphear and colleagues and Crump and colleagues, and drawing on other studies, Wilson and Wilson considered maternal IQ, HOME score, SES, parental education, birthweight, smoking, and race as characteristic variables which may have interaction effects. This analysis identifies confounding variables based on the seven longitudinal cohorts in analyses conducted by Lanphear and colleagues and by Crump and colleagues and confirms maternal IQ, HOME score, maternal education and maternal marital status at birth are "Highly Likely" confounders, while race is a "Likely" confounder. The cohort data were reanalyzed using the methods presented by Crump and colleagues while also considering the interaction among the identified confounding variables. This analysis determined that confounders influence IQ estimates in a quantifiable way that may exceed or at least obscure previously-reported effects of blood lead on IQ with blood lead levels below 5 mu g/dL; however, limitations in the datasets make predictions of the low dose dose-response analysis questionable.

The two-stage least squares instrumental variables procedure is frequently used but is not applicable to time-to-event data if some observations are censored. We develop a simultaneous equations model to account for unmeasured confounding of the effect of treatment on survival time subject to censoring. The identification of the treatment effect is assisted by instrumental variables (variables related to treatment but conditional on treatment, not to the outcome) and the assumed bivariate distribution underlying the data-generating process. The methodology is illustrated on data from an observational study of time to death following endovascular or open repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. As the instrumental variable and the distributional assumptions cannot be jointly assessed from the observed data, we evaluate the sensitivity of the results to these assumptions.

Although inverse probability weighting (IPW) has been proposed to handle attrition in association analyses, its relevance has been little studied in this context. We aimed to investigate its ability to correct for selection bias in exposure-outcome estimation by addressing an important methodological issue: the specification of the response model. Methods A simulation study compared the IPW method with complete-case analysis (CCA) for nine response-mechanism scenarios (3 missing at random - MAR and 6 missing not at random - MNAR). Eighteen response models differing by the type of variables included were assessed. Results The IPW method was equivalent to CCA in terms of bias and consistently less efficient in all scenarios, regardless of the response model tested. The most effective response model included only the confounding factors of the association model. Conclusion Our study questions the ability of the IPW method to correct for selection bias in situations of attrition leading to missing outcomes. If the method is to be used, we encourage including only the confounding variables of the association of interest in the response model.

The impact of unmeasured within- and between-cluster confounding on the bias of effect estimatorsof a continuous exposure	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Bias formula; causal inference; instrumental variables; linear mixed model; observational study; unmeasured confounders	DIALYSIS OUTCOMES; PRACTICE PATTERNS; WEAK INSTRUMENTS; ANEMIA; IDENTIFICATION; PREFERENCE	Unmeasured confounding almost always exists in observational studies and can bias estimates of exposure effects. Instrumental variable methods are popular choices in combating unmeasured confounding to obtain less biased effect estimates. However, we demonstrate that alternative methods may give less biased estimates depending on the nature of unmeasured confounding. Treatment preferences of clusters (e.g. physician practices) are the most frequently used instruments in instrumental variable analyses. These preference-based instrumental variable analyses are usually conducted on data clustered by region, hospital/facility, or physician, where unmeasured confounding often occurs within or between clusters. We aim to quantify the impact of unmeasured confounding on the bias of effect estimators in instrumental variable analysis, as well as several common alternative methods including ordinary least squares regression, linear mixed models, and fixed-effect models to study the effect of a continuous exposure (e.g. treatment dose) on a continuous outcome. We derive closed-form expressions of asymptotic bias of estimators from these four methods in the presence of unmeasured within- and/or between-cluster confounders. Simulations demonstrate that the asymptotic bias formulae well approximate bias in finite samples for all methods. The bias formulae show that instrumental variable analyses can provide consistent estimates when unmeasured within-cluster confounding exists, but not when between-cluster confounding exists. On the other hand, fixed-effect models and linear mixed models can provide consistent estimates when unmeasured between-cluster confounding exits, but not for within-cluster confounding. Whether instrumental variable analyses are advantageous in reducing bias over fixed-effect models and linear mixed models depends on the extent of unmeasured within-cluster confounding relative to between-cluster confounding. Furthermore, the impact of unmeasured between-cluster confounding on instrumental variable analysis estimates is larger than the impact of unmeasured within-cluster confounding on fixed-effect model and linear mixed model estimates. We illustrate the use of these methods in estimating the effect of erythropoiesis stimulating agents on hemoglobin levels. Our findings provide guidance for choosing appropriate methods to combat the dominant types of unmeasured confounders and help interpret statistical results in the context of unmeasured confounding.

We quantified the short-run effect of changes in household poverty status on children's health (asthma and ear infections) and service use (visits to the doctor and parent-reported hospital admissions), using a national longitudinal study of Australian children, with particular attention to potential residual confounding and selection bias due to study attrition. Methods: We use four modelling approaches differing in their capacity to reduce residual confounding (generalized linear, random effects (RE), hybrid and fixed effects (FE) regression modelling) to model the effect of income poverty (<60% of median income) on health for 10 090 children surveyed every 2nd year since 2004. For each method, we simulate the potential impact of selection bias arising due to attrition related to children's health status. Results: Of the 10 090 children included, 20% were in families in poverty at survey baseline (2004). Across subsequent years, similar to 25% experienced intermittent and <2% persistent poverty. No substantial associations between poverty and child physical health and service use were observed in the FE models least prone to residual confounding [odds ratio (OR) 0.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81-1.10 for wheeze], in contrast to RE models that were positive (consistent with previous studies). Selection bias causing null findings was unlikely. Conclusions: While poverty has deleterious causal effects on children's socio-behavioural and educational outcomes, we find little evidence of a short-run causal effect of poverty on asthma, ear infections and health service use in Australia.

When the exposure is measured with error, this raises the question whether these different estimation strategies might be differently affected and whether one of them is to be preferred for that reason. In this article, we investigate this by comparing inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) estimators and doubly robust estimators for the exposure effect in linear marginal structural mean models (MSM) with G-estimators, propensity score (PS) adjusted estimators and ordinary least squares (OLS) estimators for the exposure effect in linear regression models. We find analytically that these estimators are equally affected when exposure misclassification is independent of the confounders, but not otherwise. Simulation studies reveal similar results for time-varying exposures and when the model of interest includes a logistic link. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The "Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra" (SUN) project, conducted during 1999-2019 with 18,419 participants, was used to try to refute non-causal explanations for the inverse association found between adherence to the MedDiet and reduced CVD risk. A framework of different analytical strategies is proposed: alternative definitions of the exposure, exploration of residual confounding, resampling methods, depiction of absolute risks across the follow-up period, trial emulation, and negative controls. Additionally, we calculated the rate advancement period (RAP). We found that one standard deviation increase in the most frequently used MedDiet score was associated with a 29% relative reduction in CVD risk (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 14-41%), which is almost identical to that found in 2 randomized trials. The RAP of CVD would be postponed by an average of 7.9 years (95% CI: 1.6 to 14.2 years) by switching from low (MDS = 0 to2) to high (MDS = 7 to 9) adherence to the MedDiet in the fully adjusted model. Sensitivity analyses, graphical representations of absolute risks, trial emulation, and negative controls also supported causality. In conclusion, a framework of analytical approaches supported the causal effect of the MedDiet on CVD prevention using observational data. Similar methodology could be applied for causal inferences regarding other hypotheses.

Estimating the causal effects of cumulative treatment episodes for adolescents using marginal structural models and inverse probability of treatment weighting	DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE			English	Article						Cumulative treatment effects; Marginal structural model; Time-varying confounding; Inverse-probability-of-treatment weights; Adolescent treatment; Generalized boosted model	SUBSTANCE-ABUSE TREATMENT; DRUG-TREATMENT CAREERS; CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK; ALCOHOL; ASSOCIATION; RELIABILITY; ZIDOVUDINE; ADDICTION; AFTERCARE; ADHERENCE	Background: Substance use treatment is rarely a one-time event for individuals with substance use disorders. Sustained reductions in substance use and its related symptoms may result from multiple treatment episodes. Methods: We use a marginal structural model with inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting to estimate the causal effects of cumulative treatment experiences over a period of 9 months on drug use at the end of 1-year among 2870 adolescents receiving care in community-based treatment settings. During the 9 months, adolescents move in and out of outpatient and residential treatment with periods where they only receive biological drug screening (BDS) or no treatment at all. The use of inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting reduces confounding bias due to observed baseline and time-varying measures over the course of follow-up; weights were estimated using generalized boosted models. Results: Each additional period of treatment (representing at least one day, 1 session, or 1 BDS during the 90 day period between follow-up visits) yielded reductions in average substance use frequency at 1-year relative to no treatment during the 90-day period. For residential treatment it was a 16% decrease (95% CI = -27%, -7%), for outpatient treatment it was a 9% decrease (95% CI = -18%, -0%), and for BDS (with no additional outpatient or residential treatment) it was an 11% decrease (95% CI = -20%, -3%). Conclusions: Using robust statistical methods, we find promising (albeit preliminary) evidence that additional periods of outpatient and residential treatment, as well as biological drug screening, lead to reductions in substance use outcomes at one year.

Methods: We propose to divide systematic error into structural error and analytic error. With regard to random error, our schema shows its four major sources: nondeterministic counterfactuals, sampling variability, a mechanism that generates exposure events and measurement variability. Results: Structural error is defined from the perspective of counterfactual reasoning and divided into nonexchangeability bias (which comprises confounding bias and selection bias) and measurement bias. Directed acyclic graphs are useful to illustrate this kind of error. Nonexchangeability bias implies a lack of "exchangeability" between the selected exposed and unexposed groups. A lack of exchangeability is not a primary concern of measurement bias, justifying its separation from confounding bias and selection bias. Many forms of analytic errors result from the small-sample properties of the estimator used and vanish asymptotically. Analytic error also results from wrong (misspecified) statistical models and inappropriate statistical methods. Conclusions: Our organizational schema is helpful for understanding the relationship between systematic error and random error from a previously less investigated aspect, enabling us to better understand the relationship between accuracy, validity, and precision.

This paper evaluates methods which can be used to make this selection in linear models. The methods are applied to the selection of covariates in a study of the effect of lead in the blood on children's ability and are evaluated by a simulation study on multivariate normal data. None of the methods can be guaranteed to give satisfactory results in all cases, and all the methods can result in misleading inferences.

The optimal strategy for evaluating a disease risk score (DRS) model's ability to control confounding is less clear. DRS models cannot be evaluated through balance checks within the full population, and they are usually assessed through prediction diagnostics and goodness-of-fit tests. A proposed alternative is the "dry-run" analysis, which divides the unexposed population into "pseudo-exposed" and "pseudo-unexposed" groups so that differences on observed covariates resemble differences between the actual exposed and unexposed populations. With no exposure effect separating the pseudo-exposed and pseudo-unexposed groups, a DRS model is evaluated by its ability to retrieve an unconfounded null estimate after adjustment in this pseudo-population. We used simulations and an empirical example to compare traditional DRS performance metrics with the dry-run validation. In simulations, the dry run often improved assessment of confounding control, compared with the C statistic and goodness-of-fit tests. In the empirical example, PS and DRS matching gave similar results and showed good performance in terms of covariate balance (PS matching) and controlling confounding in the dry-run analysis (DRS matching). The dry-run analysis may prove useful in evaluating confounding control through DRS models.

Hsu	BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL			English	Editorial Material						causal inference; companion diagnostic; confounding; estimand; prognostic and predictive biomarkers; subgroup analysis		In their paper, Liu et al. (2020) pointed out illogical discrepancies between subgroup and overall causal effects for some efficacy measures, in particular the odds and hazard ratios. As the authors show, the culprit is subgroups having prognostic effects within treatment arms. In response to their provocative findings, we found that the odds and hazard ratios are logic respecting when the subgroups are purely predictive, that is, the distribution of the potential outcome for the control treatment is homogeneous across subgroups. We also found that when we redefined the odds and hazards ratio causal estimands in terms of the joint distribution of the potential outcomes, the discrepancies are resolved under specific models in which the potential outcomes are conditionally independent. In response to other discussion points in the paper, we also provide remarks on association versus causation, confounding, statistical computing software, and dichotomania.

J	Ross, RK; Breskin, A; Westreich, D				Ross, Rachael K.; Breskin, Alexander; Westreich, Daniel			When Is a Complete-Case Approach to Missing Data Valid? The Importance of Effect-Measure Modification	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						complete-case analysis; conditional estimates; epidemiologic methods; heterogeneity; marginal estimates; missing data; risk differences	SELECTION BIAS; MULTIPLE IMPUTATION; CAUSAL DIAGRAMS; COVARIATE DATA; REGRESSION; EFFICIENCY; INFERENCE	When estimating causal effects, careful handling of missing data is needed to avoid bias. Complete-case analysis is commonly used in epidemiologic analyses. Previous work has shown that covariate-stratified effect estimates from complete-case analysis are unbiased when missingness is independent of the outcome conditional on the exposure and covariates. Here, we assess the bias of complete-case analysis for adjusted marginal effects when confounding is present under various causal structures of missing data. We show that estimation of the marginal risk difference requires an unbiased estimate of the unconditional joint distribution of confounders and any other covariates required for conditional independence of missingness and outcome. The dependence of missing data on these covariates must be considered to obtain a valid estimate of the covariate distribution. If none of these covariates are effect-measure modifiers on the absolute scale, however, the marginal risk difference will equal the stratified risk differences and the complete-case analysis will be unbiased when the stratified effect estimates are unbiased. Estimation of unbiased marginal effects in complete-case analysis therefore requires close consideration of causal structure and effect-measure modification.

Standard regression modeling (e.g., ordinary logistic regression) fails to estimate the average effect of exposure in total population in the presence of interaction between exposure and covariates, and also cannot adjust for time-varying confounding appropriately. Moreover, stepwise algorithms of the selection of confounders based on P values may miss important confounders and lead to bias in effect estimates. Causal methods overcome these limitations. We illustrate three causal methods including inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighting (IPTW) and parametric g-formula, with an emphasis on a clever combination of these 2 methods: targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) which enjoys a double-robust property against bias.

Approaches to addressing missing values, measurement error, and confounding in epidemiologic studies	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Data analysis; Confounding; Measurement error; Missing data; Simulation; Regression calibration; Imputation; Regression	MULTIPLE-IMPUTATION; CAUSAL INFERENCE; BIG DATA	Objectives: Epidemiologic studies often suffer from incomplete data, measurement error (or misclassification), and confounding. Each of these can cause bias and imprecision in estimates of exposure-outcome relations. We describe and compare statistical approaches that aim to control all three sources of bias simultaneously. Study Design and Setting: We illustrate four statistical approaches that address all three sources of bias, namely, multiple imputation for missing data and measurement error, multiple imputation combined with regression calibration, full information maximum likelihood within a structural equation modeling framework, and a Bayesian model. In a simulation study, we assess the performance of the four approaches compared with more commonly used approaches that do not account for measurement error, missing values, or confounding. Results: The results demonstrate that the four approaches consistently outperform the alternative approaches on all performance metrics (bias, mean squared error, and confidence interval coverage). Even in simulated data of 100 subjects, these approaches perform well. Conclusion: There can be a large benefit of addressing measurement error, missing values, and confounding to improve the estimation of exposure-outcome relations, even when the available sample size is relatively small.

Use of instrumental variables in the analysis of generalized linear models in the presence of unmeasured confounding with applications to epidemiological research	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						instrumental variables analysis; generalized linear models; epidemiology generalized method of moments; unmeasured confounding	HEART-FAILURE; MANAGEMENT; MOMENTS; GUIDELINES; MORTALITY; DISEASE	A major, often unstated, concern of researchers carrying out epidemiological studies of medical therapy is the potential impact on validity if estimates of treatment are biased due to unmeasured confounders. One technique for obtaining consistent estimates of treatment effects in the presence of unmeasured confounders is instrumental variables analysis (IVA). This technique has been well developed in the econometrics literature and is being increasingly used in epidemiological studies. However, the approach to IVA that is most commonly used in such studies is based on linear models, while many epidemiological applications make use of non-linear models, specifically generalized linear models (GLMs) such as logistic or Poisson regression. Here we present a simple method for applying IVA within the class of GLMs using the generalized method of moments approach. We explore some of the theoretical properties of the method and illustrate its use within both a simulation example and an epidemiological study where unmeasured confounding is suspected to be present. We estimate the effects of beta-blocker therapy on one-year all-cause mortality after an incident hospitalization for heart failure, in the absence of data describing disease severity, which is believed to be a confounder.

Addressing geographic confounding through spatial propensity scores: a study of racial disparities in diabetes	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Diabetes control; doubly robust estimator; geographic confounding; health disparities; propensity scores; spatial data analysis	US POPULATION; CAUSAL INFERENCE; STROKE MORTALITY; NATIONAL-HEALTH; UNITED-STATES; REGRESSION; ADULTS; AMERICANS; TUTORIAL; MODELS	Motivated by a study exploring differences in glycemic control between non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white veterans with type 2 diabetes, we aim to address a type of confounding that arises in spatially referenced observational studies. Specifically, we develop a spatial doubly robust propensity score estimator to reduce bias associated with geographic confounding, which occurs when measured or unmeasured confounding factors vary by geographic location, leading to imbalanced group comparisons. We augment the doubly robust estimator with spatial random effects, which are assigned conditionally autoregressive priors to improve inferences by borrowing information across neighboring geographic regions. Through a series of simulations, we show that ignoring spatial variation results in increased absolute bias and mean squared error, while the spatial doubly robust estimator performs well under various levels of spatial heterogeneity and moderate sample sizes. In the motivating application, we construct three global estimates of the risk difference between race groups: an unadjusted estimate, a doubly robust estimate that adjusts only for patient-level information, and a hierarchical spatial doubly robust estimate. Results indicate a gradual reduction in the risk difference at each stage, with the inclusion of spatial random effects providing a 20% reduction compared to an estimate that ignores spatial heterogeneity. Smoothed maps indicate poor glycemic control across Alabama and southern Georgia, areas comprising the so-called "stroke belt." These results suggest the need for community-specific interventions to target diabetes in geographic areas of greatest need.

How Do Unobserved Confounding Mediators and Measurement Error Impact Estimated Mediation Effects and Corresponding Statistical Inferences? Introducing the R Package ConMed for Sensitivity Analysis	PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS			English	Article						mediation model; posttreatment confounder; unobserved mediator; measurement error; sensitivity analysis; R package	CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSES; CAUSAL; BIAS; ROBUSTNESS; PRODUCT; IDENTIFICATION; QUANTIFY; LINK	Empirical studies often demonstrate multiple causal mechanisms potentially involving simultaneous or causally related mediators. However, researchers often use simple mediation models to understand the processes because they do not or cannot measure other theoretically relevant mediators. In such cases, another potentially relevant but unobserved mediator potentially confounds the observed mediator, thereby biasing the estimated direct and indirect effects associated with the observed mediator and threatening corresponding inferences. Additionally, researchers may not know the extent to which their measures are reliable, and accordingly, measurement error may bias estimated effects and mislead statistical inferences. Given these threats, we explore how the omission of an unobserved mediator and/or using variables with measurement error biases estimates and affects inferences associated with the observed mediator. Then, building off Frank's impact threshold for a confounding variable (ITCV), we propose a correlation-based sensitivity analysis. Lastly, we provide an R package ConMed to assess the robustness of mediation inferences given the omission of an unobserved, confounding mediator and/or measurement error.Translational Abstract Researchers across fields rely on mediation analyses to understand processes between the intervention and the outcome variable. Empirical studies regularly demonstrate the existence of multiple mediation pathways, such as through simultaneous or related mediators. However, many mediation analyses only include one mediator for various reasons and there are likely additional relevant mediators that could significantly bias estimates and inferences associated with the observed mediator. At the same time, valid statistical inferences also rely on the assumption that all the variables are measured without error, while researchers may not know the extent to which their measures are reliable. In practice, it is very likely that the omission of another confounding mediator and measurement error co-occurs. However, the extant literature on the combined effect of omitted confounders and measurement error does not evaluate cases where the confounder is a mediator; they focus on pretreatment confounders where the treatment has no impact on the omitted confounder. Therefore, we fill in the research gap by examining if/how omitting an alternative mediator and/or using variables with measurement error biases estimates and affects inferences associated with the observed mediator. We present analytical results as well as an illustrative example to demonstrate the potential consequences of omitting confounding mediator(s) given different reliability levels of observed variables. Additionally, we propose a correlation-based sensitivity analysis and provide an R package to help researchers assess the robustness of their mediation inferences given the omission of an unobserved, confounding mediator and/or measurement error.

In this context, prognostic score (PGS) analysis has recently been proposed as a method for causal inference. It aims to restore balance across the different treatment groups by identifying subjects with a similar prognosis for a given reference exposure ("control"). This requires the development of a multivariable prognostic model in the control arm of the study sample, which is then extrapolated to the different treatment arms. Unfortunately, large cohorts for developing prognostic models are not always available. Prognostic models are therefore subject to a dilemma between overfitting and parsimony; the latter being prone to a violation of the assumption of no unmeasured confounders when important covariates are ignored. Although it is possible to limit overfitting by using penalization strategies, an alternative approach is to adopt evidence synthesis. Aggregating previously published prognostic models may improve the generalizability of PGS, while taking account of a large set of covariates-even when limited individual participant data are available. In this article, we extend a method for prediction model aggregation to PGS analysis in nonrandomized studies. We conduct extensive simulations to assess the validity of model aggregation, compared with other methods of PGS analysis for estimating marginal treatment effects. We show that aggregating existing PGS into a "meta-score" is robust to misspecification, even when elementary scores wrongfully omit confounders or focus on different outcomes. We illustrate our methods in a setting of treatments for asthma.

Several methods have been developed for estimating such effects by controlling for the time-dependent confounding that typically occurs. The most commonly used is marginal structural models (MSM) estimated using inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) (MSM-IPTW). An alternative, the sequential trials approach, is increasingly popular, and involves creating a sequence of "trials" from new time origins and comparing treatment initiators and non-initiators. Individuals are censored when they deviate from their treatment assignment at the start of each "trial" (initiator or noninitiator), which is accounted for using inverse probability of censoring weights. The analysis uses data combined across trials. We show that the sequential trials approach can estimate the parameters of a particular MSM. The causal estimand that we focus on is the marginal risk difference between the sustained treatment strategies of "always treat" vs "never treat." We compare how the sequential trials approach and MSM-IPTW estimate this estimand, and discuss their assumptions and how data are used differently. The performance of the two approaches is compared in a simulation study. The sequential trials approach, which tends to involve less extreme weights than MSM-IPTW, results in greater efficiency for estimating the marginal risk difference at most follow-up times, but this can, in certain scenarios, be reversed at later time points and relies on modelling assumptions. We apply the methods to longitudinal observational data from the UK Cystic Fibrosis Registry to estimate the effect of dornase alfa on survival.

Robust causal inference of drug-drug interactions	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						causal inference; drug-drug interaction; multiple robustness; pharmacoepidemiology; propensity score weighting	PROPENSITY SCORE; EMPIRICAL-LIKELIHOOD; INVERSE PROBABILITY; MISSING DATA; ADJUSTMENT; IMPUTATION; SELECTION; BIAS	There is growing interest in developing causal inference methods for multi-valued treatments with a focus on pairwise average treatment effects. Here we focus on a clinically important, yet less-studied estimand: causal drug-drug interactions (DDIs), which quantifies the degree to which the causal effect of drug A is altered by the presence versus the absence of drug B. Confounding adjustment when studying the effects of DDIs can be accomplished via inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), a standard approach originally developed for binary treatments and later generalized to multi-valued treatments. However, this approach generally results in biased results when the propensity score model is misspecified. Motivated by the need for more robust techniques, we propose two empirical likelihood-based weighting approaches that allow for specifying a set of propensity score models, with the second method balancing user-specified covariates directly, by incorporating additional, nonparametric constraints. The resulting estimators from both methods are consistent when the postulated set of propensity score models contains a correct one; this property has been termed multiple robustness. In this paper, we derive two multiply-robust estimators of the causal DDI, and develop inference procedures. We then evaluate their finite sample performance through simulation. The results demonstrate that the proposed estimators outperform the standard IPTW method in terms of both robustness and efficiency. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to evaluate the impact of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS-I) on the comparative nephrotoxicity of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) and opioids, using data derived from electronic medical records from a large multi-hospital health system.

Propensity Score Techniques and the Assessment of Measured Covariate Balance to Test Causal Associations in Psychological Research	PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS			English	Article						observational studies; causal inference; standardized bias; cannabis	INFERENCE; BIAS; SUBCLASSIFICATION; SENSITIVITY; ADJUSTMENT; REGRESSION; MODELS	There is considerable interest in using propensity score (PS) statistical techniques to address questions of causal inference in psychological research. Many PS techniques exist, yet few guidelines are available to aid applied researchers in their understanding, use, and evaluation. In this study, the authors give an overview of available techniques for PS estimation and PS application. They also provide a way to help compare PS techniques, using the resulting measured covariate balance as the criterion for selecting between techniques. The empirical example for this study involves the potential causal relationship linking early-onset cannabis problems and subsequent negative mental health outcomes and uses data from a prospective cohort study. PS techniques are described and evaluated on the basis of their ability to balance the distributions of measured potentially confounding covariates for individuals with and without early-onset cannabis problems. This article identifies the PS techniques that yield good statistical balance of the chosen measured covariates within the context of this particular research question and cohort.

J	Requia, WJ; de Melo, HFA				Requia, Weeberb J.; de Melo, Hudson Francisco Azevedo			Effectiveness of public policies related to traffic emissions in improving air quality in Brazil: A causal inference study using Bayesian structural time-series models	ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT			English	Article						Traffic emissions; Air pollution; Public policies; Causal inference	POLLUTION CONTROL; TERM EXPOSURE; SAO-PAULO; MORTALITY	Air pollution is a major environmental health risk, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. In Brazil, the government has implemented progressive stages of traffic emission controls since 1986 through a program called "Proconve". In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of two of these stages, Proconve stages L-5 and P7, in reducing air pollution in the 10 most populated cities in Brazil. We used Bayesian structural time-series models to estimate the causal effect of the vehicle emission control measures on the air pollution time series for each city and air pollutant (PM2.5, O3, NO2, and CO), accounting for potential confounding factors such as temperature and humidity. While previous studies have shown positive effects of control measures on air quality, our study suggests that the effects may not always be statistically significant, which has implications for the design and interpretation of future studies. Our study provides valuable information for policymakers in Brazil and adds to the international literature on the effectiveness of air pollution control measures. Despite the lack of statistically significant results, our study highlights the importance of considering statistical power and unmeasured confounding factors when evaluating the effectiveness of air pollution control measures.

The NNT concept can be applied whenever the risk of an adverse event is compared between two groups; for the comparison of exposed with unexposed subjects in epidemiological studies, we propose the term "number needed to be exposed" (NINE). Whereas in randomized clinical trials NNT can be calculated on the basis of a simple 2x2 table, in epidemiological studies methods to adjust for confounders are required in most applications. We derive a method based upon multiple logistic regression analysis to pet-form point and interval estimation of NNE with adjustment for confounding variables. The adjusted NNE can be calculated from the adjusted odds ratio (OR) and the unexposed event rate (UER) estimated by means of an appropriate multiple logistic regression model. As UER is dependent on the confounders, the adjusted NNEs also vary with the values of the confounding variables. Two methods are proposed to take the dependence of NNE on the values of the confounders into account. The adjusted number needed to be exposed can be a useful complement to the commonly presented results in epidemiological studies, such as ORs and attributable risks. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Although the randomized experiment is widely considered the gold standard for determining whether a given exposure increases the likelihood of some specified outcome, experiments are not always feasible and in some cases can result in biased estimates of causal effects. Alternatively, standard observational approaches are limited by the possibility of confounding, reverse causation, and the nonrandom distribution of exposure (i.e., selection). We describe the counterfactual model of causation and apply it to the challenges of causal inference in observational research, with a particular focus on aging. We argue that the study of twin pairs discordant on exposure, and in particular discordant monozygotic twins, provides a useful analog to the idealized counterfactual design. A review of discordant-twin studies in aging reveals that they are consistent with, but do not unambiguously establish, a causal effect of lifestyle factors on important late-life outcomes. Nonetheless, the existing studies are few in number and have clear limitations that have not always been considered in interpreting their results. It is concluded that twin researchers could make greater use of the discordant-twin design as one approach to strengthen causal inferences in observational research.

Recent Mendelian randomization (MR) studies have investigated direct links between chronotype and several of these traits, often in isolation of outside potential mediating or moderating traits. We mined the EpiGraphDB MR database for calculated chronotype-trait associations (p-value < 5 x 10(-8)). We then re-analyzed those relevant to metabolic or mental health and investigated for statistical evidence of horizontal pleiotropy. Analyses passing multiple testing correction were then investigated for confounders, colliders, intermediates, and reverse intermediates using the EpiGraphDB database, creating multiple chronotype-trait interactions among each of the the traits studied. We revealed 10 significant chronotype-exposure associations (false discovery rate < 0.05) exposed to 111 potential previously known confounders, 52 intermediates, 18 reverse intermediates, and 31 colliders. Chronotype-lipid causal associations collided with treatment and diabetes effects; chronotype-bipolar associations were mediated by breast cancer; and chronotype-alcohol intake associations were impacted by confounders and intermediate variables including known zeitgebers and molecular traits. We have reported the influence of chronotype on several cardiometabolic and behavioural traits, and identified potential confounding variables not reported on in studies while discovering new associations to drugs and disease.

Super learning to hedge against incorrect inference from arbitrary parametric assumptions in marginal structural modeling	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Super learning; Marginal structural model; Inverse probability weighting; Comparative effectiveness research; Time-dependent confounding; Selection bias	DEMYSTIFYING DOUBLE ROBUSTNESS; PROPENSITY SCORE ESTIMATION; CAUSAL INFERENCE; ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; REGRESSION; ADJUSTMENT; DEATH	Objective: Clinical trials are unlikely to ever be launched for many comparative effectiveness research (CER) questions. Inferences from hypothetical randomized trials may however be emulated with marginal structural modeling (MSM) using observational data, but success in adjusting for time-dependent confounding and selection bias typically relies on parametric modeling assumptions. If these assumptions are violated, inferences from MSM may be inaccurate. In this article, we motivate the application of a data-adaptive estimation approach called super learning (SL) to avoid reliance on arbitrary parametric assumptions in CER. Study Design and Setting: Using the electronic health records data from adults with new-onset type 2 diabetes, we implemented MSM with inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimation to evaluate the effect of three oral antidiabetic therapies on the worsening of glomerular filtration rate. Results: Inferences from IPW estimation were noticeably sensitive to the parametric assumptions about the associations between both the exposure and censoring processes and the main suspected source of confounding, that is, time-dependent measurements of hemoglobin A1c. SL was successfully implemented to harness flexible confounding and selection bias adjustment from existing machine learning algorithms. Conclusion: Erroneous IPW inference about clinical effectiveness because of arbitrary and incorrect modeling decisions may be avoided with SL. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Sun, H; Wang, S				Sun, Hokeun; Wang, Shuang			Network-based regularization for matched case-control analysis of high-dimensional DNA methylation data	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						DNA methylation; genetic pathways; matched case-control; network-based regularization; penalized conditional logistic; variable selection	PENALIZED COX REGRESSION; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; VARIABLE SELECTION; ALGORITHMS; LASSO; GENES; LIVER; MODEL	The matched case-control designs are commonly used to control for potential confounding factors in genetic epidemiology studies especially epigenetic studies with DNA methylation. Compared with unmatched case-control studies with high-dimensional genomic or epigenetic data, there have been few variable selection methods for matched sets. In an earlier paper, we proposed the penalized logistic regression model for the analysis of unmatched DNA methylation data using a network-based penalty. However, for popularly applied matched designs in epigenetic studies that compare DNA methylation between tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues or between pre-treatment and post-treatment conditions, applying ordinary logistic regression ignoring matching is known to bring serious bias in estimation. In this paper, we developed a penalized conditional logistic model using the network-based penalty that encourages a grouping effect of (1) linked Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpG) sites within a gene or (2) linked genes within a genetic pathway for analysis of matched DNA methylation data. In our simulation studies, we demonstrated the superiority of using conditional logistic model over unconditional logistic model in high-dimensional variable selection problems for matched case-control data. We further investigated the benefits of utilizing biological group or graph information for matched case-control data. We applied the proposed method to a genome-wide DNA methylation study on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) where we investigated the DNA methylation levels of tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues from HCC patients by using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 Beadchip. Several new CpG sites and genes known to be related to HCC were identified but were missed by the standard method in the original paper. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Until recently, Slater was one of the few communication scientists to suggest that media effects scholars engage in overcontrol. Bushman and Anderson have now echoed this concern in the context of a broader treatise on research trends in the media violence literature. The present study responded to Wright's recent discussion of control variable usage in the pornography literature. Specifically, using a national probability sample of approximately 1,900 U.S. adults, the present study assessed whether multiple demographic variables routinely modeled as controls in the pornography effects literature may be better conceptualized as initiating predictors. Results were inconsistent with the confounding approach but consistent with the hypothesis that individual differences predict cognitive response states that increase or decrease the likelihood of media effects.

Gestational Weight Gain and Long-term Maternal Obesity Risk: A Multiple-Bias Analysis	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						epidemiologic methods; bias; selection bias; retrospective studies; women&#8217; s health; gestational weight gain; obesity; pregnancy	BODY-MASS INDEX; LIFE-COURSE APPROACH; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; PREPREGNANCY WEIGHT; PRETERM DELIVERY; ATTRITION; IMPUTATION; PREGNANCY; STRATEGIES; HEALTH	Background: Lifecourse research provides an important framework for chronic disease epidemiology. However, data collection to observe health characteristics over long periods is vulnerable to systematic error and statistical bias. We present a multiple-bias analysis using real-world data to estimate associations between excessive gestational weight gain and mid-life obesity, accounting for confounding, selection, and misclassification biases. Methods: Participants were from the multiethnic Study of Women's Health Across the Nation. Obesity was defined by waist circumference measured in 1996-1997 when women were age 42-53. Gestational weight gain was measured retrospectively by self-recall and was missing for over 40% of participants. We estimated relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of obesity at mid-life for presence versus absence of excessive gestational weight gain in any pregnancy. We imputed missing data via multiple imputation and used weighted regression to account for misclassification. Results: Among the 2,339 women in this analysis, 937 (40%) experienced obesity in mid-life. In complete case analysis, women with excessive gestational weight gain had an estimated 39% greater risk of obesity (RR = 1.4, CI = 1.1, 1.7), covariate-adjusted. Imputing data, then weighting estimates at the guidepost values of sensitivity = 80% and specificity = 75%, increased the RR (95% CI) for obesity to 2.3 (2.0, 2.6). Only models assuming a 20-point difference in specificity between those with and without obesity decreased the RR. Conclusions: The inference of a positive association between excessive gestational weight gain and mid-life obesity is robust to methods accounting for selection and misclassification bias.

J	Gao, SA; Deng, HM; Wen, SB; Wang, Y				Gao, Sunan; Deng, Heming; Wen, Shaobo; Wang, Yu			Effects of accelerated biological age on depressive symptoms in a causal reasoning framework	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						Depressive symptoms; Biological age; Causal inference; Subgroup analysis; Association analysis	CHINA HEALTH; DISEASE; METHYLATION; PREVALENCE; TOBACCO; GENDER	Background: Depression in middle-aged and elderly individuals is multifaceted and heterogeneous, linked to biological age (BA) based on aging-related biomarkers. However, due to confounding with chronological age and the absence of subgroup analysis and causal reasoning, the association between BA and depressive symptoms (DS) might be unstable and requires further investigation. Methods: We utilized data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (N = 9478) to perform association analysis, causal inference, and subgroup analysis. BA acceleration (BAA) was derived using machine learning and adjusted for chronological age. A generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMM) tree algorithm was employed to identify subgroups. The causal reasoning frame included propensity score matching and fast large-scale almost matching exactly. Results: In the longitudinal analysis, BAA exhibited a consistent and significant positive association with DS, even after controlling for demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, health status, and physical functions. This association remained unchanged within the causal framework. GLMM tree analysis identified three partitioning variables (sex, satisfaction, and BMI) and five subgroups. Further subgroup analysis revealed that BAA exerted the strongest effect on DS among women with less satisfying lives. Limitations: Depressive symptoms were evaluated through scale measurements rather than clinical diagnosis. The sample was derived from the general population, not the clinically depressed population. Conclusions: This study provided the first longitudinal evidence that biological age acceleration increases depressive symptoms under causal reasoning and subgroup analysis, particularly among less satisfied women. And the association between BAA and DS was independent of known risk factors.

However, unlike other machine learning algorithms, whose development has been greatly fostered by a large amount of available benchmark datasets, causal discovery algorithms are notoriously difficult to be systematically evaluated because few datasets with known ground-truth causal relations are available. In this work, we handle the problem of evaluating causal discovery algorithms by building a flexible simulator in the medical setting. We develop a neuropathic pain diagnosis simulator, inspired by the fact that the biological processes of neuropathic pathophysiology are well studied with well-understood causal influences. Our simulator exploits the causal graph of the neuropathic pain pathology and its parameters in the generator are estimated from real-life patient cases. We show that the data generated from our simulator have similar statistics as real-world data. As a clear advantage, the simulator can produce infinite samples without jeopardizing the privacy of real-world patients. Our simulator provides a natural tool for evaluating various types of causal discovery algorithms, including those to deal with practical issues in causal discovery, such as unknown confounders, selection bias, and missing data. Using our simulator, we have evaluated extensively causal discovery algorithms under various settings.

J	Lu, B; Cai, DJ; Tong, XW				Lu, Bo; Cai, Dingjiao; Tong, Xingwei			Testing causal effects in observational survival data using propensity score matching design	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						observational studies; paired test; proportional hazards assumption; unmeasured confounding	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; INFERENCE; DIFFERENCE	Time-to-event data are very common in observational studies. Unlike randomized experiments, observational studies suffer from both observed and unobserved confounding biases. To adjust for observed confounding in survival analysis, the commonly used methods are the Cox proportional hazards (PH) model, the weighted logrank test, and the inverse probability of treatment weighted Cox PH model. These methods do not rely on fully parametric models, but their practical performances are highly influenced by the validity of the PH assumption. Also, there are few methods addressing the hidden bias in causal survival analysis. We propose a strategy to test for survival function differences based on the matching design and explore sensitivity of the P-values to assumptions about unmeasured confounding. Specifically, we apply the paired Prentice-Wilcoxon (PPW) test or the modified PPW test to the propensity score matched data. Simulation studies show that the PPW-type test has higher power in situations when the PH assumption fails. For potential hidden bias, we develop a sensitivity analysis based on the matched pairs to assess the robustness of our finding, following Rosenbaum's idea for nonsurvival data. For a real data illustration, we apply our method to an observational cohort of chronic liver disease patients from a Mayo Clinic study. The PPW test based on observed data initially shows evidence of a significant treatment effect. But this finding is not robust, as the sensitivity analysis reveals that the P-value becomes nonsignificant if there exists an unmeasured confounder with a small impact.

J	Didelez, V; Sheehan, N				Didelez, Vanessa; Sheehan, Nuala			Mendelian randomization as an instrumental variable approach to causal inference	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article							COUNT DATA MODELS; ASSOCIATION; DIAGRAMS	In epidemiological research, the causal effect of a modifiable phenotype or exposure on a disease is often of public health interest. Randomized controlled trials to investigate this effect are not always possible and inferences based on observational data can be confounded. However, if we know of a gene closely linked to the phenotype without direct effect on the disease, it can often be reasonably assumed that the gene is not itself associated with any confounding factors - a phenomenon called Mendelian randomization. These properties define an instrumental variable and allow estimation of the causal effect, despite the confounding, under certain model restrictions. In this paper, we present a formal framework for causal inference based on Mendelian randomization and suggest using directed acyclic graphs to check model assumptions by visual inspection. This framework allows us to address limitations of the Mendelian randomization technique that have often been overlooked in the medical literature.

Statistics in Medicine 23; 2937-2960) and presents a new Stata command (dr) that carries out the procedure. A double-robust estimator gives the analyst two opportunities for obtaining unbiased inference when adjusting for selection effects such as confounding by allowing for different forms of model misspecification; a double-robust estimator also can offer increased efficiency when all the models are correctly specified. We demostrate the results with a Monte Carlo simulation study, and we show how to implement the double-robust estimator on a single simulated dataset, both manually and by using the dr command.

This study aimed to investigate whether autoencoders, which are unsupervised deep learning architectures, might be leveraged to compute PS. Methods: We selected patient-level data of 128,368 first-line treated cancer patients from the Flatiron Health EHR-derived de-identified database. We trained an autoencoder architecture to learn a lower-dimensional patient representation, which we used to compute PS. To compare the performance of an autoencoder-based PS with established methods, we performed a simulation study. We assessed the balancing and adjustment performance using standardized mean differences, root mean square errors (RMSE), percent bias, and confidence interval coverage. To illustrate the application of the autoencoder-based PS, we emulated the PRONOUNCE trial by applying the trial's protocol elements within an observational database setting, comparing two chemotherapy regimens. Results: All methods but the manual variable selection approach led to well-balanced cohorts with average standardized mean differences <0.1. LASSO yielded on average the lowest deviation of resulting estimates (RMSE 0.0205) followed by the autoencoder approach (RMSE 0.0248). Altering the hyperparameter setup in sensitivity analysis, the autoencoder approach led to similar results as LASSO (RMSE 0.0203 and 0.0205, respectively). In the case study, all methods provided a similar conclusion with point estimates clustered around the null (e.g., HRautoencoder 1.01 [95% confidence interval = 0.80, 1.27] vs. HRPRONOUNCE 1.07 [0.83, 1.36]). Conclusions: Autoencoder-based PS computation was a feasible approach to control for confounding but did not perform better than some established approaches like LASSO.

Although studies using more robust methodologies provided some clarity, sources of bias persist and it remains critical to quickly address this question. In this review, we discuss pernicious sources of bias using a causal model framework, including time-varying confounder, collider, information, and time-dependent bias, in the context of recently published studies. We discuss causal inference methodologies that can address these issues, including causal diagrams, time-to-event analyses, sensitivity analyses, and marginal structural modeling. We discuss effect modification and we propose a role for causal mediation analysis to estimate indirect effects via mediating factors, especially components of the renin--angiotensin system. Thorough knowledge of these sources of bias and the appropriate methodologies to address them is crucial when evaluating observational studies to inform patient management decisions regarding whether ACE inhibitors or ARBs are associated with greater risk from COVID-19.

The severity of a SARS-CoV-2 infection could partly depend on these viral genetic characteristics. Here, we present a general conceptual framework that allows to study the effect of SARS-CoV-2 variants on COVID-19 disease severity among hospitalized patients. Methods A causal model is defined and visualized using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), in which assumptions on the relationship between (confounding) variables are made explicit. Various DAGs are presented to explore specific study design options and the risk for selection bias. Next, the data infrastructure specific to the COVID-19 surveillance in Belgium is described, along with its strengths and weaknesses for the study of clinical impact of variants. Discussion A well-established framework that provides a complete view on COVID-19 disease severity among hospitalized patients by combining information from different sources on host factors, viral factors, and healthcare-related factors, will enable to assess the clinical impact of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and answer questions that will be raised in the future. The framework shows the complexity related to causal research, the corresponding data requirements, and it underlines important limitations, such as unmeasured confounders or selection bias, inherent to repurposing existing routine COVID-19 data registries.

However, literature on work-family conflict has not specifically addressed the health of postpartum women. This study examined the relationship between work-family conflict and mental and physical health of employed mothers 11 weeks after childbirth. METHODS: Employed women, 18 years and older, were recruited while in the hospital for childbirth (N = 817; 71% response rate). Mental and physical health at 11 weeks postpartum was measured using SF-12 version 2. General linear models estimated the associations between the independent variables and health. A priori causal models and directed acyclic graphs guided selection of confounding variables. RESULTS: Analyses revealed that high levels of work interference with family were associated with significantly lower mental health scores. Medium and high levels of family interference with work revealed a dose-response relationship resulting in significantly worse mental health scores. Coworker support was strongly and positively associated with better physical health. CONCLUSIONS: Work-family conflict was negatively associated with mental health but not significantly associated with physical health. Availability of social support may relieve the burden women can experience when balancing work roles and family obligations. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

RCTs isolate the effect of the treatment from that of unwanted (confounding) co-occurring effects but they may suffer from unrepresentativeness, and thus lack external validity. On the other hand, large observational samples are often more representative of the target population but can conflate confounding effects with the treatment of interest. In this paper, we review the growing literature on methods for causal inference on combined RCTs and observational studies, striving for the best of both worlds. We first discuss identification and estimation methods that improve generalizability of RCTs using the representativeness of observational data. Classical estimators include weighting, difference between conditional outcome models and doubly robust estimators. We then discuss methods that combine RCTs and observational data to either ensure unconfoundedness of the observational analysis or to improve (conditional) average treatment effect estimation. We also connect and contrast works developed in both the potential outcomes literature and the structural causal model literature. Finally, we compare the main methods using a simulation study and real world data to analyze the effect of tranexamic acid on the mortality rate in major trauma patients. A review of available codes and new implementations is also provided.

J	Major-Smith, D				Major-Smith, Daniel			Exploring causality from observational data: An example assessing whether religiosity promotes cooperation	EVOLUTIONARY HUMAN SCIENCES			English	Article						Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children; Religion; Cooperation; Causal Inference; Sensitivity Analysis	SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; SERVICE ATTENDANCE; SELECTION BIAS; BLOOD-DONATION; ASSOCIATION; PERSONALITY; MORTALITY; INFERENCE; EDUCATION; CHILDREN	Causal inference from observational data is notoriously difficult, and relies upon many unverifiable assumptions, including no confounding or selection bias. Here, we demonstrate how to apply a range of sensitivity analyses to examine whether a causal interpretation from observational data may be justified. These methods include: testing different confounding structures (as the assumed confounding model may be incorrect), exploring potential residual confounding and assessing the impact of selection bias due to missing data. We aim to answer the causal question 'Does religiosity promote cooperative behaviour?' as a motivating example of how these methods can be applied. We use data from the parental generation of a large-scale (n = approximately 14,000) prospective UK birth cohort (the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children), which has detailed information on religiosity and potential confounding variables, while cooperation was measured via self-reported history of blood donation. In this study, there was no association between religious belief or affiliation and blood donation. Religious attendance was positively associated with blood donation, but could plausibly be explained by unmeasured confounding. In this population, evidence that religiosity causes blood donation is suggestive, but rather weak. These analyses illustrate how sensitivity analyses can aid causal inference from observational research.

J	Chen, B; Lawson, KA; Finelli, A; Saarela, O				Chen, Bo; Lawson, Keith A.; Finelli, Antonio; Saarela, Olli			Causal variance decompositions for institutional comparisons in healthcare	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Causal inference; hospital profiling; intraclass correlation; quality indicators; variance decomposition	INTRACLASS CORRELATION; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; QUALITY; RANKABILITY	There is increasing interest in comparing institutions delivering healthcare in terms of disease-specific quality indicators (QIs) that capture processes or outcomes showing variations in the care provided. Such comparisons can be framed in terms of causal models, where adjusting for patient case-mix is analogous to controlling for confounding, and exposure is being treated in a given hospital, for instance. Our goal here is to help identify good QIs rather than comparing hospitals in terms of an already chosen QI, and so we focus on the presence and magnitude of overall variation in care between the hospitals rather than the pairwise differences between any two hospitals. We consider how the observed variation in care received at patient level can be decomposed into that causally explained by the hospital performance adjusting for the case-mix, the case-mix itself, and residual variation. For this purpose, we derive a three-way variance decomposition, with particular attention to its causal interpretation in terms of potential outcome variables. We propose model-based estimators for the decomposition, accommodating different link functions and either fixed or random effect models. We evaluate their performance in a simulation study and demonstrate their use in a real data application.

Reducing bias in pelvic floor disorders research: Using directed acyclic graphs as an aid	NEUROUROLOGY AND URODYNAMICS			English	Article						bias (epidemiology); confounding; pelvic floor disorders; incontinence; research methods; women's health	UNNECESSARY ADJUSTMENT; CAUSAL; OVERADJUSTMENT; EPIDEMIOLOGY; KNOWLEDGE	Aims The aim of most pelvic floor disorders (PFD) research is to obtain an unbiased effect estimate and to make causal inferences. New developments in epidemiologic research, including the use of causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), have shown that traditional analytical strategies for research can be inadequate, leading to unintended consequences such as introducing additional bias. Although DAGs have been proven to be useful in other medical fields, their use has been limited in PFD research. The aim of this paper is to introduce DAGs and then demonstrate their application in PFD research. This paper will also illustrate how relying purely on statistical techniques can lead to pitfalls in reducing bias in research studies. Methods/Results: DAGs are a graphical epidemiologic tool that provide a method to select for potential confounders and minimize bias in the design and analysis of research studies. We start by providing an introduction to DAGs. We then describe six scenarios in PFD research in which DAGs can be helpful: (1) identifying appropriate confounding variables for adjustment; (2) identifying potential over-adjustment when conditioning on a mediator; (3) identifying unintended confounding due to inappropriate adjustment; (4) identifying unintended selection bias due to inappropriate adjustment; (5) planning analyses in cross-sectional studies; and (6) using DAGs as a framework to help plan data collection and analyses in PFD research. Conclusions: We demonstrate how the application of DAGs as an aid to PFD research can help to decrease bias and discuss the insights and implications for study design and analytical approaches.

J	Vansteelandt, S; Lange, C				Vansteelandt, Stijn; Lange, Christoph			Causation and causal inference for genetic effects	HUMAN GENETICS			English	Review							MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION; MEDIATION; EPISTASIS; STRATIFICATION; ADJUSTMENT; KNOWLEDGE; SELECTION; DIAGRAMS; TESTS	Over the past three decades, substantial developments have been made on how to infer the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome, using data from observational studies, with the randomized experiment as the golden standard. These developments have reshaped the paradigm of how to build statistical models, how to adjust for confounding, how to assess direct effects, mediated effects and interactions, and even how to analyze data from randomized experiments. The congruence of random transmission of alleles during meiosis and the randomization in controlled experiments/trials, suggests that genetic studies may lend themselves naturally to a causal analysis. In this contribution, we will reflect on this and motivate, through illustrative examples, where insights from the causal inference literature may help to understand and correct for typical biases in genetic effect estimates.

Internal validity means that the study measured what It set out to; external validity Is the ability to generalise from the study to the reader's patients. With respect to internal validity, selection bias, Information bias, and confounding are present to some degree in all observational research. Selection bias stems from an absence of comparability between groups being studied. Information bias results from Incorrect determination of exposure, outcome, or both. The effect of Information bias depends on Its type. If Information Is gathered differently for one group than for another, bias results. By contrast, non-differential misclassification tends to obscure real differences. Confounding Is a mixing or blurring of effects: a researcher attempts to relate an exposure to an outcome but actually measures the effect of a third factor (the confounding variable). Confounding can be controlled In several ways: restriction, matching, stratification, and more sophisticated multivariate techniques. If a reader cannot explain away study results on the basis of selection, information, or confounding bias, then chance might be another explanation. Chance should be examined last, however, since these biases can account for highly significant, though bogus results. Differentiation between spurious, Indirect, and causal associations can be difficult. Criteria such as temporal sequence, strength and consistency of an association, and evidence of a dose-response effect lend support to a causal link.

Effects of Omitting Non-confounding Predictors From General Relative-Risk Models for Binary Outcomes	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						bias; binary outcomes; general relative-risk model; generalized nonlinear model; logistic regression; omitted covariate	SELECTING CONTROLS; BREAST-CANCER; RADIATION; EFFICIENCY; COVARIATE; TIME	Background: The effects, in terms of bias and precision, of omitting non-confounding predictive covariates from generalized linear models have been well studied, and it is known that such omission results in attenuation bias but increased precision with logistic regression. However, many epidemiologic risk analyses utilize alternative models that are not based on a linear predictor, and the effect of omitting non-confounding predictive covariates from such models has not been characterized. Methods: We employed simulation to study the effects on risk estimation of omitting non-confounding predictive covariates from an excess relative risk (ERR) model and a general additive-multiplicative relative-risk mixture model for binary outcome data in a case-control setting. We also compared the results to the effects with ordinary logistic regression. Results: For these commonly employed alternative relative-risk models, the bias was similar to that with logistic regression when the risk was small. More generally, the bias and standard error of the risk-parameter estimates demonstrated patterns that are similar to those with logistic regression, but with greater magnitude depending on the true value of the risk. The magnitude of bias and standard error had little relation to study size or underlying disease prevalence. Conclusions: Prior conclusions regarding omitted covariates in logistic regression models can be qualitatively applied to the ERR and the general additive-multiplicative relative-risk mixture model without substantial change. Quantitatively, however, these alternative models may have slightly greater omitted-covariate bias, depending on the magnitude of the true risk being estimated.

ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA			English	Article							BLOOD-PRESSURE-MEASUREMENT; PALLIATIVE CARE RESEARCH; RANDOMIZED-TRIALS; ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT; MEDIATION ANALYSIS; PROPENSITY-SCORE; SELECTION BIAS; CLINICAL-TRIALS; MATCHED-COHORT; TOTAL HIP	Epidemiologists seek to make a valid inference about the causal effect between an exposure and a disease in a specific population, using representative sample data from a specific population. Clinical researchers likewise seek to make a valid inference about the association between an intervention and outcome(s) in a specific population, based upon their randomly collected, representative sample data. Both do so by using the available data about the sample variable to make a valid estimate about its corresponding or underlying, but unknown population parameter. Random error in an experiment can be due to the natural, periodic fluctuation or variation in the accuracy or precision of virtually any data sampling technique or health measurement tool or scale. In a clinical research study, random error can be due to not only innate human variability but also purely chance. Systematic error in an experiment arises from an innate flaw in the data sampling technique or measurement instrument. In the clinical research setting, systematic error is more commonly referred to as systematic bias. The most commonly encountered types of bias in anesthesia, perioperative, critical care, and pain medicine research include recall bias, observational bias (Hawthorne effect), attrition bias, misclassification or informational bias, and selection bias. A confounding variable is a factor associated with both the exposure of interest and the outcome of interest. A confounding variable (confounding factor or confounder) is a variable that correlates (positively or negatively) with both the exposure and outcome. Confounding is typically not an issue in a randomized trial because the randomized groups are sufficiently balanced on all potential confounding variables, both observed and nonobserved. However, confounding can be a major problem with any observational (nonrandomized) study. Ignoring confounding in an observational study will often result in a "distorted" or incorrect estimate of the association or treatment effect. Interaction among variables, also known as effect modification, exists when the effect of 1 explanatory variable on the outcome depends on the particular level or value of another explanatory variable. Bias and confounding are common potential explanations for statistically significant associations between exposure and outcome when the true relationship is noncausal. Understanding interactions is vital to proper interpretation of treatment effects. These complex concepts should be consistently and appropriately considered whenever one is not only designing but also analyzing and interpreting data from a randomized trial or observational study.

Over the last decade, with closer cooperation across laboratories, we are able to accumulate more variables and data for analysis, while each lab may only measure a subset of them, due to technical constraints or to save time and cost. This raises a question of how to handle causal discovery from multiple data sets with non-identical variable sets, and at the same time, it would be interesting to see how more recorded variables can help to mitigate the confounding problem. In this paper, we propose a principled method to uniquely identify causal relationships over the integrated set of variables from multiple data sets, in linear, non-Gaussian cases. The proposed method also allows distribution shifts across data sets. Theoretically, we show that the causal structure over the integrated set of variables is identifiable under testable conditions. Furthermore, we present two types of approaches to parameter estimation: one is based on maximum likelihood, and the other is likelihood free and leverages generative adversarial nets to improve scalability of the estimation procedure. Experimental results on various synthetic and real-world data sets are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of our methods.

Clarifying questions about "risk factors": predictors versus explanation	EMERGING THEMES IN EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Risk factor; Predictor; Cause; Statistical inference; Scientific inference; Confounding; Selection bias	CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION; TELOMERE LENGTH; THERAPY; CANCER; BIAS	Background: In biomedical research much effort is thought to be wasted. Recommendations for improvement have largely focused on processes and procedures. Here, we additionally suggest less ambiguity concerning the questions addressed. Methods: We clarify the distinction between two conflated concepts, prediction and explanation, both encompassed by the term "risk factor", and give methods and presentation appropriate for each. Results: Risk prediction studies use statistical techniques to generate contextually specific data-driven models requiring a representative sample that identify people at risk of health conditions efficiently (target populations for interventions). Risk prediction studies do not necessarily include causes (targets of intervention), but may include cheap and easy to measure surrogates or biomarkers of causes. Explanatory studies, ideally embedded within an informative model of reality, assess the role of causal factors which if targeted for interventions, are likely to improve outcomes. Predictive models allow identification of people or populations at elevated disease risk enabling targeting of proven interventions acting on causal factors. Explanatory models allow identification of causal factors to target across populations to prevent disease. Conclusion: Ensuring a clear match of question to methods and interpretation will reduce research waste due to misinterpretation.	[Schooling, C.

Bounding Bias Due to Selection	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Bias analysis; Selection bias; Sensitivity analysis; Target population	OBESITY PARADOX; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; EXPLANATION; ESTROGENS	When epidemiologic studies are conducted in a subset of the population, selection bias can threaten the validity of causal inference. This bias can occur whether or not that selected population is the target population and can occur even in the absence of exposure-outcome confounding. However, it is often difficult to quantify the extent of selection bias, and sensitivity analysis can be challenging to undertake and to understand. In this article, we demonstrate that the magnitude of the bias due to selection can be bounded by simple expressions defined by parameters characterizing the relationships between unmeasured factor(s) responsible for the bias and the measured variables. No functional form assumptions are necessary about those unmeasured factors. Using knowledge about the selection mechanism, researchers can account for the possible extent of selection bias by specifying the size of the parameters in the bounds. We also show that the bounds, which differ depending on the target population, result in summary measures that can be used to calculate the minimum magnitude of the parameters required to shift a risk ratio to the null. The summary measure can be used to determine the overall strength of selection that would be necessary to explain away a result. We then show that the bounds and summary measures can be simplified in certain contexts or with certain assumptions. Using examples with varying selection mechanisms, we also demonstrate how researchers can implement these simple sensitivity analyses. See video abstract at, http://links.lww.com/EDE/B535.

Is there a causal relationship between acute stage sensorimotor cortex activity and the development of chronic low back pain? a protocol and statistical analysis plan	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							MOTOR CORTEX; ISSLS PRIZE; INFERENCE; REORGANIZATION; DISABILITY; EXPLANATION; PROGNOSIS	Introduction Why some people develop chronic pain following an acute episode of low back pain is unknown. Recent cross-sectional studies have suggested a relationship between aberrant sensorimotor cortex activity and pain persistence. The UPWaRD (Understanding persistent Pain Where it ResiDes) cohort study is the first prospective, longitudinal investigation of sensorimotor cortex activity in low back pain. This paper describes the development of a causal model and statistical analysis plan for investigating the causal effect of sensorimotor cortex activity on the development of chronic low back pain. Methods and analysis Sensorimotor cortex activity was assessed within 6 weeks of low back pain onset using somatosensory evoked potentials and transcranial magnetic stimulation mapping techniques. Chronic low back pain is defined as ongoing pain (Numerical Rating score >= 1) or disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire score >= 3) at 6 months follow-up. Variables that could confound the relationship between sensorimotor cortex activity and chronic low back pain were identified using a directed acyclic graph and content expertise was used to specify known causal paths. The statistical model was developed 'a priori' to control for confounding variables identified in the directed acyclic graph, allowing an unbiased estimate of the causal effect of sensorimotor activity in acute low back pain on the development of chronic pain. The statistical analysis plan was finalised prior to follow-up of all participants and initiation of analysis.

Meta-analysis of lung cancer in asphalt roofing and paving workers with external adjustment for confounding by coal tar	JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HYGIENE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Health Effects of Occupational Exposure to Emissions from Asphalt/Bitumen Symposium	JUN 07-08, 2006	BG Acad Occupat Hlth & Safety, Dresden, GERMANY	ACGIH, Commiss Invest Hlth Hazards Chem Compounds Work Area, DFG	BG Acad Occupat Hlth & Safety	meta-analysis; confounding; asphalt; coal tar; epidemiology; lung cancer	BITUMEN FUME; AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; MORTALITY; RISK; EXPOSURE; COHORT; OCCUPATION; SMOKING; CARCINOGENICITY; ROOFERS	The study's objectives were to update Partanen's and Boffetta's 1994 meta- analysis of lung cancer among roofing and paving asphalt workers and explore the role of coal tar in explaining the statistical heterogeneity among these studies. Information retrieval strategies and eligibility criteria were defined for identifying the epidemiologic studies to be included in the analysis. The relative risk ratio ( RR) for lung cancer was selected as the effect measure of interest. Coal tar bias factors were developed and used to externally adjust each eligible study's published RR for confounding by coal tar. Confidence intervals on adjusted RRs were estimated by the Monte Carlo methods outlined by Steenland and Greenland ( 2004). The meta- Relative Risk ( meta- RR) and its variance were estimated by general variance- based methods. Heterogeneity of the RRs was assessed by heterogeneity chisquare and I-2 tests. Also explored were the influences of study design; differences between internally and externally adjusted RRs; and the potential impact of coal tar misclassification. The results from this update were similar to those in Partanen's and Boffetta's original meta- analysis. The unadjusted metaRR ( random effects model) for the roofing studies was elevated ( meta- RR= 1.67, 95% CI = 1.39 - 2.02, I-2 = 80%) and significantly greater than the meta- RR for the paving studies ( meta RR=0.98, 95% CI = 0.81 - 1.18, I-2 = 59%). After adjustment for confounding by coal tar, however, the corrected roofers' meta- RR dropped to 1.10 ( meta- RR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.91 1.33, I-2 = 60%), while the corrected pavers' meta- RR was nearly unchanged at 0.96 ( meta- RR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.80 1.16, I-2 = 56%). Although the meta- RRs for the roofers and the pavers were no longer statistically significantly different from one another, significant heterogeneity remained within each of the coal tar- adjusted sectors. Stratifying the roofing and paving studies by study design revealed that statistical heterogeneity was concentrated in the weaker designs such as those relying on death certificates for work history. When the weaker studies were excluded, the remaining roofing and paving studies had a combined meta- RR close to 1.0 ( meta- RR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.88 - 1.17) with no significant heterogeneity ( I-2 = 0%). Meta- analysis of non- experimental epidemiologic studies is subject to significant uncertainties as is externally correcting studies for confounding. Given these uncertainties, the specific quantitative estimates in this ( or any similar) analysis must be viewed with caution. Nevertheless, this analysis provides support for the hypothesis proposed by several major reviewers that confounding by coal tar- related PAH exposures may explain most or all of the lung cancer risks found in the epidemiologic literature on asphalt roofing and paving workers.

Evaluating large-scale propensity score performance through real-world and synthetic data experiments	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Propensity score; epidemiological methods; observational study; pharmacoepidemiology; negative controls; method evaluation	HEALTH-CARE DATABASE; VARIABLE SELECTION; CONFOUNDING ADJUSTMENT; BALANCE; MODELS; COHORT; BASE	Background: Propensity score adjustment is a popular approach for confounding control in observational studies. Reliable frameworks are needed to determine relative propensity score performance in large-scale studies, and to establish optimal propensity score model selection methods. Methods: We detail a propensity score evaluation framework that includes synthetic and real-world data experiments. Our synthetic experimental design extends the 'plasmode' framework and simulates survival data under known effect sizes, and our real-world experiments use a set of negative control outcomes with presumed null effect sizes. In reproductions of two published cohort studies, we compare two propensity score estimation methods that contrast in their model selection approach: L-1-regularized regression that conducts a penalized likelihood regression, and the 'high-dimensional propensity score' (hdPS) that employs a univariate covariate screen. We evaluate methods on a range of outcome-dependent and outcome-independent metrics. Results: L-1-regularization propensity score methods achieve superior model fit, covariate balance and negative control bias reduction compared with the hdPS. Simulation results are mixed and fluctuate with simulation parameters, revealing a limitation of simulation under the proportional hazards framework. Including regularization with the hdPS reduces commonly reported non-convergence issues but has little effect on propensity score performance. Conclusions: L-1-regularization incorporates all covariates simultaneously into the propensity score model and offers propensity score performance superior to the hdPS marginal screen.

Statistical modeling of complex health outcomes and air pollution data: Application of air quality health indexing for asthma risk assessment	EPIDEMIOLOGY BIOSTATISTICS AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						negative binomial model; Poisson model; confounding; time series data; air quality health index	EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT VISITS; TIME-SERIES; HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS; DAILY MORTALITY; CASE-CROSSOVER; SAINT JOHN; CHILDREN; RATES; LEAD; ASSOCIATION	Background: When fitting statistical models for complex health outcome data; zero inflation, autocorrelation, confounding, and seasonality play an important role in accurately assessing air pollution risk, especially when using such model estimates for national air quality health indices (NAQHI) formation. NAQHI generalizes model estimates across all geographies and seasons and neglects area and season specific variations. The aim here is to develop complex statistical models, specific to the data structures and to demonstrate effectiveness of these model estimates in public health message delivery using NAQHI. Methods: I fitted zero inflated, auto regressive, Poisson and Negative Binomial models with lagged effects for sparse asthma admissions and ambient air pollution data and compared the model risk estimates with that of the NAQHI. Data came from two sites, Halifax, an urban, traffic and industry polluted site and Sydney, a rural waste disposal polluted site, in the province of Nova Scotia, Canada. Data complexity structure was assessed by comparing the estimates with and without each structure. Results: NAQHI used three pollutants, Nitrogen Dioxide, Ozone and particulate matter. I found Carbon monoxide in the urban site and lead in the waste disposal site as prominent pollutants with significant seasonal differences. The findings demonstrated severe under-assessment of asthma admission relative risk by NAQHI, when auto correlation and zero inflation are ignored whereby prominent pollutant effects are omitted. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the importance of complex statistical model use and the consequences of not consideration of specific data structures in public health risk assessments.

A Simulation-Based Assessment of Alternative Explanations for Apparent Confounding in "PM Decomposition" Studies	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Simulation; Particulate matter; Mortality; Confounding; PM decomposition	PARTICULATE AIR-POLLUTION; EXTENDED FOLLOW-UP; MEASUREMENT ERROR; DAILY MORTALITY; UNITED-STATES; 6 CITIES; EXPOSURE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PM2.5; PARTICLES	Determining whether there is a causal link between chronic exposure to PM2.5 (atmospheric particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 mu m or less) and mortality is a fundamental challenge in determining appropriate air quality standards for PM2.5. While numerous epidemiological studies have found a statistical association between PM2.5 and mortality, unmeasured confounding in this relationship remains a concern. Several recent studies have examined the possibility of unmeasured confounding of the long-term association between PM2.5 exposure and mortality by decomposing PM2.5 into two orthogonal components - a "global" component that measures the national trend in pollution, and a "local" component that measures the local trend in pollution after controlling for the national trend. Generally, these "PM decomposition" studies find that while PM2.5 and mortality are trending downward over time at the national level, areas with steeper declines in PM2.5 do not have correspondingly steep declines in mortality. This finding is consistent with the long-term relationship between PM2.5 and mortality being confounded by some other, unmeasured, long-term trends. However, alternative explanations for these findings have been proposed under which there is still a causal link between PM2.5 and mortality. This study conducts simulation-based tests of four of these proposed alternative explanations - the omission of spatial variation in PM2.5 and mortality, confounding at the local level, measurement error, and an association between PM(2.5 )and mortality at a different time scale than those tested in the PM decomposition studies. We find that none of these alternative explanations can reproduce the results in the PM decomposition studies while simultaneously allowing for a causal link between PM2.5 and mortality.

Evaluation of Complementary and Integrative Health Approaches Among US Veterans with Musculoskeletal Pain Using Propensity Score Methods	PAIN MEDICINE			English	Article						Complementary and Integrative Health Approaches (CIH); Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSD); Propensity Score (PS) Matching; Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW); PIRs; Average Treatment Effect; Causal Inference; Absolute Difference (AD)	LOW-BACK-PAIN; CAUSAL INFERENCE; CARE; ACUPUNCTURE; MANAGEMENT; ASSOCIATIONS; DIAGNOSIS; DESIGN; COHORT; USERS	Objectives. To examine the treatment effectiveness of complementary and integrative health approaches (CIH) on chronic pain using Propensity Score (PS) methods. A retrospective cohort of 309,277 veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain assessed over three years after initial diagnosis. CIH exposure was defined as one or more clinical visits for massage, acupuncture, or chiropractic care. The treatment effect of CIH on self-rated pain intensity was examined using a longitudinal model. PS-matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were used to account for potential selection and confounding biases. At baseline, veterans with (7,621) and without (301,656) CIH exposure differed significantly in 21 out of 35 covariates. During the follow-up period, on average CIH recipients had 0.83 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.77 to 0.89) points higher pain intensity ratings (range = 010) than nonrecipients. This apparent unfavorable effect size was reduced to 0.37 (95% CI = 0.28 to 0.45) after PS matching, 0.36 (95% CI = 0.29 to 0.44) with IPTW on the treated (IPTW-T) weighting, and diminished to null when integrating IPTW-T with PS matching (0.004, 95% CI = 0.09 to 0.10). An alternative IPTW model and conventional covariate adjustment appeared least powerful in terms of potential bias reduction. Sensitivity analyses restricting the follow-up period to one year after CIH initiation derived consistent results. PS-based causal methods successfully eliminated baseline difference between exposure groups in all measured covariates, yet they did not detect a significant difference in the self-rated pain intensity outcome between veterans who received CIHs and those who did not during the follow-up period.

Inverse Probability Weighting in Sexually Transmitted Infection/Human Immunodeficiency Virus Prevention Research: Methods for Evaluating Social and Community Interventions	SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASES			English	Article							MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; HIV PREVENTION; CAUSAL INFERENCE; ZIDOVUDINE	Background: Intervention effects estimated from nonrandomized intervention studies are plagued by biases, yet social or structural intervention studies are rarely randomized. There are underutilized statistical methods available to mitigate biases due to self-selection, missing data, and confounding in longitudinal, observational data permitting estimation of causal effects. We demonstrate the use of Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) to evaluate the effect of participating in a combined clinical and social sexually transmitted infection/human immunodeficiency virus prevention intervention on reduction of incident chlamydia and gonorrhea infections among sex workers in Brazil. Methods: We demonstrate the step-by-step use of IPW, including presentation of the theoretical background, data set up, model selection for weighting, application of weights, estimation of effects using varied modeling procedures, and discussion of assumptions for use of IPW. Results: A total of 420 sex workers contributed 840 data points on incident chlamydia and gonorrhea infection. Participators were compared with nonparticipators following application of inverse probability weights to correct for differences in covariate patterns between exposure groups and between those who remained in the intervention and those who were lost-to-follow-up. Estimators using 4 model selection procedures provided estimates of intervention effect between odds ratio 0.43 (95% CI, 0.22-0.85) and 0.53 (95% CI, 0.26-1.1). Conclusions: After correcting for selection bias, loss-to-follow-up, and confounding, our analysis suggests a protective effect of participating in the intervention. Evaluations of behavioral, social, and multilevel interventions to prevent sexually transmitted infection can benefit by introduction of weighting methods such as IPW.

A nonparametric binomial likelihood approach for causal inference in instrumental variable models	JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN STATISTICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Causal inference; Distributional treatment effect; Nonparametric likelihood; Nonparametric two-sample test		Instrumental variable methods allow for inference about the treatment effect by controlling for unmeasured confounding in randomized experiments with noncompliance. However, many studies do not consider the observed compliance behavior in the testing procedure, leading to loss of power. In this paper, we propose a novel nonparametric likelihood approach, referred to as the binomial likelihood method, that incorporates information on compliance behavior while overcoming several limitations of previous techniques. Our proposed method produces proper estimates of the counterfactual distribution functions by maximizing the binomial likelihood over the space of distribution functions. Using this we propose two versions of a binomial likelihood ratio test for the null hypothesis of no treatment effect, and study their finite sample and asymptotic properties. We also develop an efficient algorithm for computing our estimates, and apply the method to study the effect of Medicaid coverage on mental health using the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment.

Causal effect estimation strategies in a longitudinal study with complex time-varying confounders: A tutorial	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						sciatica; causal; inverse probability weighting; propensity	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; ZIDOVUDINE; SURVIVAL; SCIATICA; SURGERY	The Dutch Sciatica Trial represents a longitudinal study with complex time-varying confounders as patients with poorer health conditions (e.g. more severe pain) are more likely to opt for surgery, which, in turn, may affect future outcomes (pain severity). A straightforward classical as-treated comparison at the end point would lead to biased estimation of the surgery effect. We present several strategies of causal treatment effect estimation that might be applicable for analyzing such data. These include an inverse probability of treatment weighted regression analysis, a marginal weighted analysis, an unweighted regression analysis, and several propensity score-based approaches. In addition, we demonstrate how to evaluate these approaches in a thorough simulation study where we generate various realistic complex confounding patterns akin to the sciatica study.

J	Pearl, J				Pearl, Judea			Invited Commentary: Understanding Bias Amplification	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Editorial Material						bias (epidemiology); confounding factors (epidemiology); epidemiologic methods; instrumental variable; precision; simulation; variable selection	MEDICAL LITERATURE; CRITICAL-APPRAISAL	In choosing covariates for adjustment or inclusion in propensity score analysis, researchers must weigh the benefit of reducing confounding bias carried by those covariates against the risk of amplifying residual bias carried by unmeasured confounders. The latter is characteristic of covariates that act like instrumental variables-that is, variables that are more strongly associated with the exposure than with the outcome. In this issue of the Journal (Am J Epidemiol. 2011; 174(11): 1213-1222), Myers et al. compare the bias amplification of a near-instrumental variable with its bias-reducing potential and suggest that, in practice, the latter outweighs the former. The author of this commentary sheds broader light on this comparison by considering the cumulative effects of conditioning on multiple covariates and showing that bias amplification may build up at a faster rate than bias reduction. The author further derives a partial order on sets of covariates which reveals preference for conditioning on outcome-related, rather than exposure-related, confounders.

Considerable attention has been devoted to the optimal choice of treatment model for propensity score-based methods and, more recently. to variable selection in the treatment model for inverse weighting in MSMs However, little attention has been paid to the modeling of the outcome of interest, particularly with respect to the best use of purely predictive, non-confounding variables in MSMs. Four modeling approaches are investigated in the context of both static treatment sequences and optimal dynamic treatment rules with the goal of estimating a marginal effect with the least error, both in terms of bias and variability.

Under the standard instrumental variable model, however, the average treatment effect is only partially identifiable. To address this, we propose novel assumptions that enable identification of the average treatment effect. Our identification assumptions are clearly separated from model assumptions that are needed for estimation, so researchers are not required to commit to a specific observed data model in establishing identification. We then construct multiple estimators that are consistent under three different observed data models, and multiply robust estimators that are consistent in the union of these observed data models. We pay special attention to the case of binary outcomes, for which we obtain bounded estimators of the average treatment effect that are guaranteed to lie between -1 and 1. Our approaches are illustrated with simulations and a data analysis evaluating the causal effect of education on earnings.

J	Wang, JX				Wang, Jixian			To use or not to use propensity score matching?	PHARMACEUTICAL STATISTICS			English	Article						causal inference; dose-exposure-response relationship; health technology assessment; modeling and simulation	MULTIVARIATE; PERFORMANCE; BALANCE; ESTIMATORS	Propensity score matching (PSM) has been widely used to reduce confounding biases in observational studies. Its properties for statistical inference have also been investigated and well documented. However, some recent publications showed concern of using PSM, especially on increasing postmatching covariate imbalance, leading to discussion on whether PSM should be used or not. We review empirical and theoretical evidence for and against its use in practice and revisit the property of equal percent bias reduction and adapt it to more practical situations, showing that PSM has some additional desirable properties. With a small simulation, we explore the impact of caliper width on biases due to mismatching in matched samples and due to the difference between matched and target populations and show some issue of PSM may be due to inadequate caliper selection. In summary, we argue that the right question should be when and how to use PSM rather than to use or not to use it and give suggestions accordingly.

A propensity score approach to estimating child restraint effectiveness in preventing mortality	STATISTICS AND ITS INTERFACE			English	Article						Marginal structural model; Selection bias; Confounding; Fatality; Child safety seat; Injury epidemiology	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; VEHICLE CRASHES; BELT; RISK; ADJUSTMENT; SELECTION; INJURY; SAMPLE; SEATS	Confounding between the child's restraint use and driver behavior can bias restraint effectiveness estimates away from the null if survivable crashes are more common in certain restraint types. Analyzing only fatal crashes may introduce selection bias toward the null because any protective effects of a restraint type will underrepresent children in that restraint. A marginal-structural-model-type estimator suggests a 17% reduction in fatality risk for children aged 2 through 6 in child restraint systems relative to seat belts. This reduction is estimated at 22% when severe misuse of the restraint is excluded.

Estimation of local treatment effects under the binary instrumental variable model	BIOMETRIKA			English	Article						Causal inference; Model compatibility; Semiparametric efficiency; Variation independence	ROBUST ESTIMATION; CAUSAL INFERENCE; IDENTIFICATION	Instrumental variables are widely used to deal with unmeasured confounding in observational studies and imperfect randomized controlled trials. In these studies, researchers often target the so-called local average treatment effect as it is identifiable under mild conditions. In this paper we consider estimation of the local average treatment effect under the binary instrumental variable model. We discuss the challenges of causal estimation with a binary outcome and show that, surprisingly, it can be more difficult than in the case with a continuous outcome. We propose novel modelling and estimation procedures that improve upon existing proposals in terms of model congeniality, interpretability, robustness and efficiency. Our approach is illustrated via simulation studies and a real data analysis.

Study design synopsis: Bias can cast a dark shadow over studies	EQUINE VETERINARY JOURNAL			English	Editorial Material						horse; confounding; epidemiology; random error; systematic error; validity	NONDIFFERENTIAL MISCLASSIFICATION; HYDROXYETHYL STARCH; MEASUREMENT ERROR; CAUSAL DIAGRAMS; SELECTION BIAS; RISK-FACTORS; ALWAYS BIAS; EXPOSURE; ASSOCIATION; IDENTIFY	The study of free-living populations is important to generate knowledge related to the epidemiology of disease and other health outcomes. These studies are unable to provide the same level of control as is possible in laboratory studies and thus are susceptible to certain errors. The primary categories of study errors are random and systematic. Random errors cause imprecision and can be quantified using statistical methods including the calculation of confidence intervals. Systematic errors cause bias, which is typically difficult to quantify within the context of an individual study. The three main categories of systematic errors are selection, information, and confounding bias. Selection bias occurs when enrolled animals are not representative of the target population of interest in respect to characteristics important to the primary study objective. Information bias occurs when data collected from enrolled animals deviates from the true value. Information bias is most damaging when errors vary among comparison groups. Both selection and information bias are prevented through the application of good study design procedures. Researchers should select study animals after careful consideration of the primary study objective and desired target population. Investigators can reduce information bias through standardised data collection procedures and the use of blinding. Confounding bias occurs when the measured association between a predictor and an outcome ignores the influential effect of an additional variable. Confounding is common and analysts must implement the appropriate statistical adjustments to reduce the associated bias. All studies will have some errors and biased data with high precision are the most damaging to the validity of study conclusions. Authors can facilitate the critical evaluation of their research by providing text related to the limitations and potential sources of bias within the discussion section of their manuscripts.

Estimation of causal quantile effects with a binary instrumental variable and censored data	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY			English	Article						censored quantile regression; complier quantile causal effect; instrumental variable (IV); stochastic integral estimating equation; unmeasured Confounder	PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL; KERNEL ESTIMATION; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; SURVIVAL; REGRESSION; INFERENCE; IDENTIFICATION; IMPACT	The causal effect of a treatment is of fundamental interest in the social, biological and health sciences. Instrumental variable (IV) methods are commonly used to determine causal treatment effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding. In this work, we study a new binary IV framework with randomly censored outcomes where we propose to quantify the causal treatment effect by the concept of complier quantile causal effect (CQCE). The CQCE is identifiable under weaker conditions than the complier average causal effect when outcomes are subject to censoring, and it can provide useful insight into the dynamics of the causal treatment effect. Employing the special characteristic of the binary IV and adapting the principle of conditional score, we uncover a simple weighting scheme that can be incorporated into the standard censored quantile regression procedure to estimate CQCE. We develop robust non-parametric estimation of the derived weights in the first stage, which permits stable implementation of the second stage estimation based on existing software. We establish rigorous asymptotic properties for the proposed estimator, and confirm its validity and satisfactory finite-sample performance via extensive simulations. The proposed method is applied to a bone marrow transplant data set to evaluate the causal effect of rituximab in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients.

J	Qin, X; Yang, F				Qin, Xu; Yang, Fan			Simulation-Based Sensitivity Analysis for Causal Mediation Studies	PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS			English	Article						causal mediation analysis; confounders; propensity score; sensitivity analysis; simulation	NATURAL DIRECT; INFERENCE; MODEL; IDENTIFICATION; ASSUMPTIONS; VARIABLES; BIAS	Causal inference regarding a hypothesized mediation mechanism relies on the assumptions that there are no omitted pretreatment confounders (i.e., confounders preceding the treatment) of the treatment-mediator, treatment-outcome, and mediator-outcome relationships, and there are no posttreatment confounders (i.e., confounders affected by the treatment) of the mediator-outcome relationship. It is crucial to conduct a sensitivity analysis to determine if a potential violation of the assumptions would easily change analytic conclusions. This article proposes a simulation-based method to assess the sensitivity to unmeasured pretreatment confounding, assuming no posttreatment confounding. It allows one to (a) quantify the strength of an unmeasured pretreatment confounder through its conditional associations with the treatment, mediator, and outcome; (b) simulate the confounder from its conditional distribution; and (c) finally assess its influence on both the point estimation and estimation efficiency by comparing the results before and after adjusting for the simulated confounder in the analysis. The proposed sensitivity analysis strategy can be implemented for any causal mediation analysis method. It is applicable to both randomized experiments and observational studies and to mediators and outcomes of different scales. A visualization tool is provided for vivid representations of the sensitivity analysis results. An R package mediationsens has been developed for researchers to implement the proposed method easily (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mediationsens/index.html).

J	Zhang, FQ; Tapera, TM; Gou, JT				Zhang, Fengqing; Tapera, Tinashe M.; Gou, Jiangtao			Application of a new dietary pattern analysis method in nutritional epidemiology	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Dietary pattern analysis; LASSO; Principal component analysis; Cardiovascular disease; Food-frequency questionnaire; NHANES	HEALTHY EATING INDEX; CLUSTER-ANALYSIS; RISK PREDICTION; DISEASE; LASSO; SELECTION; QUALITY; MODELS; SCORES; CANCER	BackgroundDiet plays an important role in chronic disease, and the use of dietary pattern analysis has grown rapidly as a way of deconstructing the complexity of nutritional intake and its relation to health. Pattern analysis methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA), have been used to investigate various dimensions of diet. Existing analytic methods, however, do not fully utilize the predictive potential of dietary assessment data. In particular, these methods are often suboptimal at predicting clinically important variables.MethodsWe propose a new dietary pattern analysis method using the advanced LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) model to improve the prediction of disease-related risk factors. Despite the potential advantages of LASSO, this is the first time that the model has been adapted for dietary pattern analysis. Hence, the systematic evaluation of the LASSO model as applied to dietary data and health outcomes is highly innovative and novel. Using Food Frequency Questionnaire data from NHANES 2005-2006, we apply PCA and LASSO to identify dietary patterns related to cardiovascular disease risk factors in healthy US adults (n=2609) after controlling for confounding variables (e.g., age and BMI). Both analyses account for the sampling weights. Model performance in terms of prediction accuracy is evaluated using an independent test set.ResultsPCA yields 10 principal components (PCs) that together account for 65% of the variation in the data set and represent distinct dietary patterns. These PCs are then used as predictors in a regression model to predict cardiovascular disease risk factors. We find that LASSO better predicts levels of triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol (adjusted R-2=0.861, 0.899, 0.890, and 0.935 respectively) than does the traditional, linear-regression-based, dietary pattern analysis method (adjusted R-2=0.163, 0.005, 0.235, and 0.024 respectively) when the latter is applied to components derived from PCA.ConclusionsThe proposed method is shown to be an appropriate and promising statistical means of deriving dietary patterns predictive of cardiovascular disease risk. Future studies, involving different diseases and risk factors, will be necessary before LASSO's broader usefulness in nutritional epidemiology can be established.

A sensitivity analysis using information about measured confounders yielded improved uncertainty assessments for unmeasured confounding	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						unmeasured confounding; bias; observational studies; sensitivity analysis; Bayesian statistics; pharmacoepidemiology	HEART-FAILURE; MORTALITY; BIAS; ADJUSTMENT; BLOCKERS; DATABASE	Objective: In the analysis of observational data, the argument is sometimes made that if adjustment for measured confounders induces little change in the treatment-outcome association, then there is less concern about the extent to which the association is driven by unmeasured confounding. We quantify this reasoning using Bayesian sensitivity analysis (BSA) for unmeasured confounding. Using hierarchical models, the confounding effect of a binary unmeasured variable is modeled as arising from the same distribution as that of measured confounders. Our objective is to investigate the performance of the method compared to sensitivity analysis, which assumes that there is no relationship between measured and unmeasured confounders. Study Design and Setting: We apply the method in an observational study of the effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy in heart failure patients. Results: BSA for unmeasured confounding using hierarchical prior distributions yields an odds ratio (OR) of 0.72, 95% credible interval (CrI): 0.56, 0.93 for the association between beta-blockers and mortality, whereas using independent priors yields OR = 0.72, 95% CrI: 0.45, 1.15. Conclusion: If the confounding effect of a binary unmeasured variable is similar to that of measured confounders, then conventional sensitivity analysis may give results that overstate the uncertainty about bias.

We examined the association between abruption and neurodevelopment at 8 months and 4 and 7 years and evaluated the extent to which these associations were mediated through preterm delivery. Design Secondary analysis of a multicenter prospective cohort study. Setting Multicenter US National Collaborative Perinatal Project (1959-76). Population Women that delivered singleton live births. Methods Analyses of IQ scores were based on marginal structural models (MSM) to account for losses to follow-up. We also carried out a causal mediation analysis to evaluate if the association between abruption and cognitive deficits was mediated through preterm delivery, and performed a sensitivity analysis for unobserved confounding. Main outcome measures We evaluated cognitive development based on the Bayley scale at 8 months (Mental and Motor Scores), and intelligent quotient (IQ) based on the Stanford-Binet scale at 4 years and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children at 7 years. Results The confounder and selection-bias adjusted risk ratio (RR) of abnormal 8-month Motor and Mental assessments were 2.35 (95% CI 1.39, 3.98) and 2.03 (95% CI 1.13, 3.64), respectively, in relation to abruption. The associations at 4 years were attenuated and resolved at 7 years. The proportion of children with abruption-associated neurological deficits mediated through preterm delivery ranged from 27 to 75%. Following adjustment for unobserved confounding the proportion mediated through preterm delivery was attenuated. Conclusion The effect of abruption on neurodevelopmental outcomes appears restricted to an effect that is largely mediated through preterm delivery.	[Ananth, C. V.; Friedman, A. M.; Lavery, J.

A Bayesian view of doubly robust causal inference	BIOMETRIKA			English	Article						Bayesian causal inference; Double robustness; Inverse probability of treatment weighting; Propensity score regression	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; PROPENSITY; ADJUSTMENT	In causal inference the effect of confounding may be controlled using regression adjustment in an outcome model, propensity score adjustment, inverse probability of treatment weighting or a combination of these. Approaches based on modelling the treatment assignment mechanism, along with their doubly robust extensions, have been difficult to motivate using formal likelihood-based or Bayesian arguments, as the treatment assignment model plays no part in inferences concerning the expected outcomes. On the other hand, forcing dependency between the outcome and treatment assignment models by allowing the former to be misspecified results in loss of the balancing property of the propensity scores and the loss of any double robustness. In this paper, we explain in the framework of misspecified models why doubly robust inferences cannot arise from purely likelihood-based arguments. As an alternative to Bayesian propensity score analysis, we propose a Bayesian posterior predictive method for constructing doubly robust estimation procedures by incorporating the inverse treatment assignment probabilities as importance sampling weights in Monte Carlo integration.

Unpacking the income to health association after midlife	HEALTH			English	Article						causality; fixed-effects; health; Health and Retirement Study; income; wealth	SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; IMPACT; INEQUALITIES; CAUSATION; EDUCATION; MOBILITY	This article estimates the effect of household financial resources on health after midlife using models that minimize health-related selectivity and unobserved heterogeneity bias. I focus on the self-rated health and mobility limitations of adults transitioning into retirement over six panels of the Health and Retirement Study (1992-2002; age 51-61 at wave one; N = 7602). Standard regression models that adjust for health-related selection with prospective and retrospective controls suggest a significant influence of long-term income on health, but an insignificant influence of short-term income. Further adjustment for unobserved fixed effects also suggests that short-term income is insignificant. Sizable recent and long-term health feedbacks to income for a portion of the HRS respondents underscore the need to control for the confounding influence of health over the lifecourse. Together these results suggest that adults after midlife are heterogeneous with respect to the causal and selective processes generating the observed association between income and health.

Dynamic marginal structural modeling to evaluate the comparative effectiveness of more or less aggressive treatment intensification strategies in adults with type 2 diabetes	PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY			English	Article						marginal structural model; inverse probability weighting estimation; comparative effectiveness; safety; diabetes; treatment intensification	PROPENSITY SCORES; CAUSAL INFERENCE; GLUCOSE CONTROL; ASSOCIATION; HYPERGLYCEMIA; ADJUSTMENT; STATEMENT; OUTCOMES; ACCORD	Purpose Chronic disease care typically involves treatment decisions that are frequently adjusted to the patient's evolving clinical course (e.g., hemoglobin A1c monitoring and treatment intensification in diabetes patients). Thus, in comparative effectiveness and safety research (CER), it often is less clinically relevant to contrast the health effects of static treatment decisions than to compare the effectiveness of competing medical guidelines, that is, adaptive treatment strategies that map the patient's unfolding clinical course to subsequent treatment decisions. With longitudinal observational studies, treatment decisions at any point in time may be influenced by clinical factors that also are risk factors for the outcome of interest. Such time-dependent confounders cannot be properly handled with standard statistical approaches, because such confounders may be influenced by previous treatment decisions and may thus lie on causal pathways between the very outcomes and early treatment decisions whose effects are under study. Under explicit assumptions, we motivate the application of inverse probability weighting estimation to fit dynamic marginal structural models (MSMs) in observational studies to address pragmatic CER questions and properly adjust for time-dependent confounding and informative loss to follow-up. Methods We review the principles behind this modeling approach and describe its application in an observational study of type 2 diabetes patients to investigate the comparative effectiveness of four adaptive treatment intensification strategies for glucose control on subsequent development or progression of urinary albumin excretion. Results Results indicate a protective effect of more aggressive treatment intensification strategies in patients already on two or more oral agents or basal insulin. These conclusions are concordant with recent randomized trials. Conclusions Inverse probability weighting estimation to fit dynamic MSM is a viable and appealing alternative to inadequate standard modeling approaches in many CER problems where time-dependent confounding and informative loss to follow-up are expected.

J	Choi, J; Dekkers, OM; le Cessie, S				Choi, Jungyeon; Dekkers, Olaf M.; le Cessie, Saskia			A comparison of different methods to handle missing data in the context of propensity score analysis	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Missing data; Propensity score analysis; Multiple imputation; Missing indicator; Effect modification; Missingness graph	MULTIPLE-IMPUTATION; UNTREATED SUBJECTS; CHAINED EQUATIONS; BALANCE; BIAS; PERFORMANCE; ABILITY; MODELS	Propensity score analysis is a popular method to control for confounding in observational studies. A challenge in propensity methods is missing values in confounders. Several strategies for handling missing values exist, but guidance in choosing the best method is needed. In this simulation study, we compared four strategies of handling missing covariate values in propensity matching and propensity weighting. These methods include: complete case analysis, missing indicator method, multiple imputation and combining multiple imputation and missing indicator method. Concurrently, we aimed to provide guidance in choosing the optimal strategy. Simulated scenarios varied regarding missing mechanism, presence of effect modification or unmeasured confounding. Additionally, we demonstrated how missingness graphs help clarifying the missing structure. When no effect modification existed, complete case analysis yielded valid causal treatment effects even when data were missing not at random. In some situations, complete case analysis was also able to partially correct for unmeasured confounding. Multiple imputation worked well if the data were missing (completely) at random, and if the imputation model was correctly specified. In the presence of effect modification, more complex imputation models than default options of commonly used statistical software were required. Multiple imputation may fail when data are missing not at random. Here, combining multiple imputation and the missing indicator method reduced the bias as the missing indicator variable can be a proxy for unobserved confounding. The optimal way to handle missing values in covariates of propensity score models depends on the missing data structure and the presence of effect modification. When effect modification is present, default settings of imputation methods may yield biased results even if data are missing at random.

Methods: According to the selection criteria, patients were included from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression, propensity score matching, and a multivariate competing risk model were used to investigate the association between Lauren's classification and prognosis. Subgroup analysis was used to investigate the role of confounding factors on the association between Lauren types and prognosis. Results: After exclusion, a total of 20,218 patients from the SEER database were included, with 14,374 intestinal types and 5,844 diffuse types. The univariate Cox regression analysis revealed that the diffuse type had a poorer cancer-specific survival (CSS) rate [hazard ratio (HR), 1.44; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.38-1.50]. After adjusting for confounding variables, the diffuse type also showed a higher risk of cancer-specific death (HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.15-1.20). Sensitivity analysis showed that after propensity score matching, the diffuse type had a poorer CSS rate (HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.10-1.36), and the competing risk model further validated these results [subdistribution HR (SHR), 1.32; 95% CI, 1.23-1.41]. Moreover, subgroup analysis demonstrated stable results in the subgroups, except for patients with T1 stage (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.87-1.28) and a tumor size <2 cm (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.83-1.21). Conclusions: Diffuse-type gastric adenocarcinoma had an overall poorer prognosis compared to the intestinal type. However, in patients with T1 stage and tumor size <2 cm, the diffuse type had a comparable survival rate with the intestinal type.

The Norwegian Job Management Program (JUMP), sought to enhance occupational outcomes by augmenting VR with either cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) techniques aiming to improve psychotic symptoms or cognitive remediation (CR) aiming to improve cognition. CBT is standard treatment in schizophrenia, but recent meta-analyses question the effect of CBT on negative psychotic symptoms. It is of interest to study the causal role of psychotic symptoms and cognitive functioning on occupational functioning. Methods Data from the JUMP VR - program, was reanalyzed with a causal inference method to assess the causal effects of reduced symptoms / improved neurocognitive functioning on occupational functioning measured by number of working hours per week. Participants (N = 131) had been randomized to either VR + CBT (N = 68) or VR + CR (N = 63). Large improvements in number of working hours were demonstrated in both intervention groups (nonsignificant group difference). G-estimation was used to assess the strength and nature of the causal effects, adjusted for time-varying confounding and selection - bias from loss to follow-up. Results Significant causal effects of reduction in each of four dimensions of symptoms and improved neurocognition respectively, on number of working hours were found (separate models). The effect of negative symptoms was the strongest and increased in magnitude during the whole observation period, while the effect of two other symptoms and neurocognition was constant. Adjusted for confounding (including potential feedback), the causal effect of a hypothetical change in negative symptoms equal to the average improvement in the CBT group corresponded to an increase in working hours of 3.2 h per week (95% CI: 1.11, 5.35). Conclusion High performance of g-estimation in a small psychiatric data set with few repeated measures and time-varying confounding and effects, was demonstrated. Augmented vocational rehabilitation showed causal effects of intervention targets with the strongest and increasing effect from negative symptoms on number of working hours. Combination of therapy and activation (indirect and direct approach) might explain improvement in both cognition and negative symptoms, and shed some light on effective ingredients for improved treatment of negative symptoms.

The statistical analysis of these studies makes use of the standard instrumental variables framework. Many of these studies focus on elderly populations, thereby ignoring the problem of left truncation, which arises due to the selection of study participants being conditional upon surviving up to the time of study onset. Such selection, in general, invalidates the assumptions on which the instrumental variables analysis rests. We show that Mendelian randomization studies of adult or elderly populations will therefore, in general, return biased estimates of the exposure effect when the considered genotype affects mortality; in contrast, standard tests of the causal null hypothesis that the exposure does not affect the mortality rate remain unbiased, even when they ignore this problem of left truncation. To eliminate "survivor bias" or "truncation bias" from the effect of exposure on mortality, we next propose various simple strategies under a semi-parametric additive hazard model. We examine the performance of the proposed methods in simulation studies and use them to infer the effect of vitamin D on all-cause mortality based on the Monica10 study with the genetic variant filaggrin as instrumental variable.

Dana			On the relationship of sufficient component cause models with potential outcome (counterfactual) models	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						causality; sufficient-component cause; counterfactual; exchangeability; interaction; confounding		The sufficient-component cause (SSC) model provides a useful, concise method to conceptualize and organize ideas concerning biologic effects and interactions of multiple factors. Another type of model, the potential outcome or counterfactual models, has also proved useful in epidemiology, providing insights into definitions of effects, exchangeability and confounding, and selection bias. Prior work has shown important links between these two types of models. Here, we show additional connections between the two types of models. We first review basic concepts for both the SSC model and the potential outcome models. We then indicate additional similarities between them, and derive a quantitative link. Our results show that the SSC model actually corresponds to a unique response pattern in a particular potential outcome model. Recognition of the links between the two models should allow greater insight into use of each model, and allow the strengths of both models to be used jointly.

The statistical methodology for estimating population average causal effect has been well established. However, the methods for identifying and estimating subpopulation causal effects are relatively less developed. Part of the challenge is that the subgroup structure is usually unknown, therefore, methods working well for population level effect need to be modified to address this. A tree method based on a matched design is proposed to identify subgroups with differential treatment effects. To remove observed confounding, propensity-score-matched pairs are first created. Then the classification and regression tree is applied to the within-pair outcome differences to identify the subgroup structure. This non-parametric approach is robust to model misspecification, which is important because it becomes much harder to specify a parametric outcome model in the presence of subgroup effects. In addition to describing assumptions under which our matching estimator is unbiased, algorithms for identifying subgroup structures are provided. Simulation results indicate that the proposed approach compares favorably, in terms of the percentage of correctly identifying true tree structure, with other competing tree-based methods, including causal trees, causal inference trees and the virtual twins approach. Finally the proposed method is implemented to examine the potential subgroup effect of the timing of Tobramycin use on chronic infection among pediatric Cystic Fibrosis patients.

J	Yoo, C; Gonzalez, E; Gong, ZH; Roy, D				Yoo, Changwon; Gonzalez, Efrain; Gong, Zhenghua; Roy, Deodutta			A Better Mechanistic Understanding of Big Data through an Order Search Using Causal Bayesian Networks	BIG DATA AND COGNITIVE COMPUTING			English	Article						mechanistic understanding; Bayesian analysis; machine learning; statistical data analysis; big data; systems biology	ALGORITHM	Every year, biomedical data is increasing at an alarming rate and is being collected from many different sources, such as hospitals (clinical Big Data), laboratories (genomic and proteomic Big Data), and the internet (online Big Data). This article presents and evaluates a practical causal discovery algorithm that uses modern statistical, machine learning, and informatics approaches that have been used in the learning of causal relationships from biomedical Big Data, which in turn integrates clinical, omics (genomic and proteomic), and environmental aspects. The learning of causal relationships from data using graphical models does not address the hidden (unknown or not measured) mechanisms that are inherent to most measurements and analyses. Also, many algorithms lack a practical usage since they do not incorporate current mechanistic knowledge. This paper proposes a practical causal discovery algorithm using causal Bayesian networks to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanistic process that generated the data. The algorithm utilizes model averaging techniques such as searching through a relative order (e.g., if gene A is regulating gene B, then we can say that gene A is of a higher order than gene B) and incorporates relevant prior mechanistic knowledge to guide the Markov chain Monte Carlo search through the order. The algorithm was evaluated by testing its performance on datasets generated from the ALARM causal Bayesian network. Out of the 37 variables in the ALARM causal Bayesian network, two sets of nine were chosen and the observations for those variables were provided to the algorithm. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by comparing its prediction with the generating causal mechanism. The 28 variables that were not in use are referred to as hidden variables and they allowed for the evaluation of the algorithm's ability to predict hidden confounded causal relationships. The algorithm's predicted performance was also compared with other causal discovery algorithms. The results show that incorporating order information provides a better mechanistic understanding even when hidden confounded causes are present. The prior mechanistic knowledge incorporated in the Markov chain Monte Carlo search led to the better discovery of causal relationships when hidden variables were involved in generating the simulated data.

Bayesian Model Averaging to Account for Model Uncertainty in Estimates of a Vaccine's Effectiveness	CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Bayesian model averaging; model uncertainty; vaccine effectiveness; Lyme vaccine	VARIABLE SELECTION; ADJUSTMENT; INFERENCE	Purpose: Vaccine effectiveness (VE) studies are often conducted after the introduction of new vaccines to ensure they provide protection in real-world settings. Control of confounding is often needed during the analyses, which is most efficiently done through multivariable modeling. When many confounders are being considered, it can be challenging to know which variables need to be included in the final model. We propose an intuitive Bayesian model averaging (BMA) framework for this task. Patients and Methods: Data were used from a matched case-control study that aimed to assess the effectiveness of the Lyme vaccine post-licensure. Cases were residents of Connecticut, 15-70 years of age with confirmed Lyme disease. Up to 2 healthy controls were matched to each case subject by age. All participants were interviewed, and medical records were reviewed to ascertain immunization history and evaluate potential confounders. BMA was used to systematically search for potential models and calculate the weighted average VE estimate from the top subset of models. The performance of BMA was compared to three traditional single-best-model-selection methods: two-stage selection, stepwise elimination, and the leaps and bounds algorithm. Results: The analysis included 358 cases and 554 matched controls. VE ranged between 56% and 73% and 95% confidence intervals crossed zero in <5% of all candidate models. Averaging across the top 15 models, the BMA VE was 69% (95% CI: 18-88%). The two-stage, stepwise, and leaps and bounds algorithm yielded VE of 71% (95% CI: 21-90%), 73% (95% CI: 26-90%), and 74% (95% CI: 27-91%), respectively. Conclusion: This paper highlights how the BMA framework can be used to generate transparent and robust estimates of VE. The BMA-derived VE and confidence intervals were similar to those estimated using traditional methods. However, by incorporating model uncertainty into the parameter estimation, BMA can lend additional rigor and credibility to a well-designed study.

Study Design and Setting: Interrupted time series design was applied to study the prevalence of statin use in Dutch diabetes patients over the period 1998-2011. Effects of guideline changes on the outcome were estimated using a Poisson regression model with and without the birth cohort dimension modeled through random intercepts. Results: Both models estimated a stronger increase in prevalence of statin use after influential studies were published in 2003 for patients aged below 50 and above 70 years. The model that controlled for birth cohort also estimated an effect for patients aged 50-70 years from 2003 onward. The magnitude of the intervention effect for patients aged above 70 years when we controlled for birth cohort was reduced from 0.078 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.065, 0.091] to 0.027 (95% CI: 0.013, 0.041). Similarly, for patients aged below 50 years, the estimated guideline effect was reduced from 0.070 (95% CI: 0.048, 0.092) to 0.055 (95% CI: 0.035, 0.075). Conclusion: In this case study, the birth cohort dimension appeared to confound population-level effect estimates of guideline changes on prevalence of statin use in patients with diabetes.

Sharp sensitivity bounds for mediation under unmeasured mediator-outcome confounding	BIOMETRIKA			English	Article						Bounding factor; Causal inference; Collider; Natural direct effect; Natural indirect effect	NATURAL DIRECT; LUNG-CANCER; IDENTIFICATION; SMOKING; MODELS	It is often of interest to decompose the total effect of an exposure into a component that acts on the outcome through some mediator and a component that acts independently through other pathways. Said another way, we are interested in the direct and indirect effects of the exposure on the outcome. Even if the exposure is randomly assigned, it is often infeasible to randomize the mediator, leaving the mediator-outcome confounding not fully controlled. We develop a sensitivity analysis technique that can bound the direct and indirect effects without parametric assumptions about the unmeasured mediator-outcome confounding.

Estimating Causal Effects under Network Interference with Bayesian Generalized Propensity Scores	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						causal inference; interference; spillover effect; Bayesian inference; network data	STATA PACKAGE; INFERENCE; DESIGN; ADJUSTMENT; UNITS; POPULATION; STATISTICS	Real-world systems are often comprised of interconnected units, and can be represented as networks, with nodes and edges. In a social system, for instance, individuals may have social ties and financial relationships. In these settings, when a node (the unit analysis) is exposed to a treatment, its effects may spill over to connected units; then estimating both the direct effect of the treatment and its spillover effects presents several challenges. First, assumptions about the mechanism through which spillover effects occur along the observed network are required. Second, in observational studies, where the treatment assignment has not been randomized, confounding and homophily are further potential threats to the identification and to the estimation of causal effects, on networks. Here, we make two structural assumptions: (i) neighborhood interference, which assumes interference operates only through a function of the immediate neighbors' treatments, and (ii) unconfoundedness of the individual and neighborhood treatment, which rules out the presence of unmeasured confounding variables, including those driving homophily. Under these assumptions we develop a new covariate-adjustment estimator for direct treatment and spillover effects in observational studies on networks. We proposed an estimation strategy based on a generalized propensity score that balances individual and neighborhood covariates across units under different levels of individual treatment and of exposure to neighbors' treatment. Adjustment for propensity score is performed using a penalized spline regression. Our inference strategy capitalizes on a three-step Bayesian procedure, which allows to take account for the uncertainty in the propensity score estimation, and avoids model feedback. The correlation among connected units is taken into account using a community detection algorithm, and incorporating random effects in the outcome model. All these sources of variability, including variability of treatment assignment, are accounted for in the posterior distribution of the finite-sample causal estimands we target. We design a simulation study to assess the performance of the proposed estimator on different network topologies, both on synthetic networks and on real friendship network from the Add-Health study.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the causal relationship between strengthening the total phosphorus (TP) concentration standard in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents and river water quality in the Geum River watershed (Rep. of Korea). Data, including precipitation, streamflow, and water quality, were collected for 2005-2020 and temporally divided into "before " and "after " the event of strengthening standards (in 2012). Further, the data were spatially divided into influence sites (impact) affected by the event and control sites (control) unaffected by the event. A median difference test for a before/after and control/ impact (BACI) analysis and a causal impact analysis (CIA) based on a Bayesian structural time-series model were performed to evaluate the changes in water quality after the event. The BACI test showed that the TP concentration was reduced significantly (p-value < 0.05) at all impact sites after the event, whereas the difference was not significant at the control sites. In contrast, other water quality variables, except TP, showed different statistical significance depending on the site. The CIA was performed by controlling the rainfall, flow rate, suspended solids, water temperature, biochemical oxygen demand, and chemical oxygen demand as covariates, which were selected based on a directed acyclic graph and bi-variable correlation analysis. The CIA results showed that the TP concentration was reduced significantly (p-value < 0.05) at all impact sites, except for the control sites after the event, which is consistent with the BACI results. The causal impact of environmental management policies was previously difficult to evaluate by objectively targeting the natural systems because of the confounding bias. Our study demonstrated that strengthening the TP concentration standard from WWTPs majorly contributed to reducing TP in the receiving river, even when confounding factors, such as fluctuations in non-point source pollution loads caused by rainfall and runoff, were excluded. The statistical approaches used in this study can be valuable and practical methods for such evaluations if sufficient prior and posterior data and appropriate covariates are obtained.

VALUE IN HEALTH			English	Article						asthma; instrumental variable; propensity score; regression analysis	TRAINING-PROGRAMS; PROPENSITY SCORE; REGIONAL-VARIATIONS; LINEAR-MODELS; PANEL-DATA; ECONOMETRICS; SATISFACTION; REGRESSION; SELECTION; OUTCOMES	Objective: To review the efficacy of instrumental variable (IV) models in addressing a variety of assumption violations to ensure standard ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates are consistent. IV models gained popularity in outcomes research because of their ability to consistently estimate the average causal effects even in the presence of unmeasured confounding. However, in order for this consistent estimation to be achieved, several conditions must hold. In this article, we provide an overview of the IV approach, examine possible tests to check the prerequisite conditions, and illustrate how weak instruments may produce inconsistent and inefficient results. Methods: We use two IVs and apply Shea's partial R-square method, the Anderson canonical correlation, and Cragg-Donald tests to check for weak instruments. Hall-Peixe tests are applied to see if any of these instruments are redundant in the analysis. Results: A total of 14,952 asthma patients from the MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Database were examined in this study. Patient health care was provided under a variety of fee-for-service, fully capitated, and partially capitated health plans, including preferred provider organizations, point of service plans, indemnity plans, and health maintenance organizations. We used controller-reliever copay ratio and physician practice/prescribing patterns as an instrument. We demonstrated that the former was a weak and redundant instrument producing inconsistent and inefficient estimates of the effect of treatment. The results were worse than the results from standard regression analysis. Conclusion: Despite the obvious benefit of IV models, the method should not be used blindly. Several strong conditions are required for these models to work, and each of them should be tested. Otherwise, bias and precision of the results will be statistically worse than the results achieved by simply using standard OLS.

Between 1995 and 2007, 950 human immunodeficiency virus-positive men and women were followed in 2 US cohort studies. During 4,054 person-years, 374 initiated highly active antiretroviral therapy, 211 developed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or died, and 173 dropped out. Accounting for measured confounders and determinants of dropout, the weighted hazard ratio for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or death comparing use of highly active antiretroviral therapy in the prior 2 years with no therapy was 0.36 (95% confidence limits: 0.21, 0.61). This association was relatively constant over follow-up (P = 0.19) and stronger than crude or adjusted hazard ratios of 0.75 and 0.95, respectively. Accounting for measurement error in reported exposure using external validation data on 331 men and women provided a hazard ratio of 0.17, with bias shifted from the hazard ratio to the estimate of precision as seen by the 2.5-fold wider confidence limits (95% confidence limits: 0.06, 0.43). Marginal structural measurement-error models can simultaneously account for 3 major sources of bias in epidemiologic research: validated exposure measurement error, measured selection bias, and measured time-fixed and time-varying confounding.

Methods: Medline and Embase were used to identify studies that described at least one association between an exposure and an outcome using both traditional regression and propensity score methods to control for confounding. From 43 studies, 78 exposure-outcome associations were found. Measures of the quality of propensity score implementation were determined. The statistical significance of each association using both analytical methods was compared. The odds or hazard ratios derived using both methods were compared quantitatively. Results: Statistical significance differed between regression and propensity score methods for only 8 of the associations (10%), kappa = 0.79 (95% Cl = 0.65-0.92). In all cases, the regression method gave a statistically significant association not observed with the propensity score method. The odds or hazard ratio derived using propensity scores was, on average, 6.4% closer to unity than that derived using traditional regression. Conclusions: Observational studies had similar results whether using traditional regression or propensity scores to adjust for confounding. Propensity scores gave slightly weaker associations; however, many of the reviewed studies did not implement propensity scores well. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In contrast, in most observational studies in the health and social sciences, the primary study data do not identify and may not even bound target parameters. Discrepancies between target and analogous identified parameters (biases) are then of paramount concern, which forces a major shift in modeling strategies. Conventional approaches are based on conditional testing of equality constraints, which correspond to implausible point-mass priors. When these constraints are not identified by available data, however, no such testing is possible. In response, implausible constraints can be relaxed into penalty functions derived from plausible prior distributions. The resulting models can be fit within familiar full or partial likelihood frameworks. The absence of identification renders all analyses part of a sensitivity analysis. In this view, results from single models are merely examples of what might be plausibly inferred. Nonetheless, just one plausible inference may suffice to demonstrate inherent limitations of the data. Points are illustrated with misclassified data from a study of sudden infant death syndrome. Extensions to confounding, selection bias and more complex data structures are outlined.

Some studies have also used field data to investigate potential causal relationships between variables. However, inferring causal effects from observational data is complex due to potential confounding effects and careful analyses using specific statistical and data mining techniques as well as different sets of assumptions are required. Nonetheless, although virtually unknown in the agricultural research community, such methods are available and have been used in many other fields. In this paper, we review and discuss the analysis of observational data using field-recorded information and its potential utility in the study of causal effects in livestock. It is our postulation that there is much to be learned from such data, which can be used either to explicitly investigate causal relationships between variables or to generate hypotheses for further investigation using controlled experiments or additional field-recorded data.

SumHer is a newly introduced alternative with similar aims. We show using theory and simulations that both approaches fail to adequately account for confounding bias, even when the assumed heritability model is correct. Consequently, these methods may estimate heritability poorly if there was an inadequate adjustment for confounding in the original GWAS analysis. We also show that the choice of a summary statistic for use in LDSC or SumHer can have a large impact on resulting inferences. Further, covariate adjustments in the original GWAS can alter the target of heritability estimation, which can be problematic for test statistics from a meta-analysis of GWAS with different covariate adjustments.

A common phenomenon in such spatial regression models is spatial confounding. This phenomenon is observed when spatially indexed covariates modeling the mean of the response are correlated with a spatial random effect included in the model, for example, as a proxy of unobserved spatial confounders. As a result, estimates for regression coefficients of the covariates can be severely biased and interpretation of these is no longer valid. Recent literature has shown that typical solutions for reducing spatial confounding can lead to misleading and counterintuitive results. In this article, we develop a computationally efficient spatial model that explicitly correlates a Gaussian random field for the covariate of interest with the Gaussian random field in the main model equation and integrates novel prior structures to reduce spatial confounding. Starting from the univariate case, we extend our prior structure also to the case of multiple spatially confounded covariates. In simulation studies, we show that our novel model flexibly detects and reduces spatial confounding in spatial datasets, and it performs better than typically used methods such as restricted spatial regression. These results are promising for any applied researcher who wishes to interpret covariate effects in spatial regression models. As a real data illustration, we study the effect of elevation and temperature on the mean of monthly precipitation in Germany.

We demonstrate how time-varying covariates and selection bias influence association estimates between anticoagulation and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with atrial fibrillation. We performed a secondary analysis of the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management trial quality of life substudy. Dichotomized warfarin use was ascertained at the study baseline, 2 months later, and annually for up to 6 years. HRQoL was measured at every time point using a self-reported ordinal 5-point Likert-scale (lower score and lower odds ratio represents better health-related quality of life). Static and time-varying covariates were ascertained throughout the study period. Confounder-adjusted generalized mixed model and generalized estimating equation regressions were used to demonstrate traditional association estimates between anticoagulation and HRQoL. Inverse probability of treatment and censorship weights were used to ascertain the influence of time-varying confounding and selection bias. Age-stratified analysis (age >= 70 years) evaluated for effect modification. 656 individuals were included in the analysis, 601 on warfarin at baseline. The association of warfarin use with better HRQoL over time strengthened when accounting for time-varying confounding and selection bias (OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.14-0.55) compared to traditional analyses (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38-0.97), and was most pronounced in those >= 70 years upon stratified analysis. Anticoagulation is associated with higher HRQoL in patients with atrial fibrillation, with time-varying confounding and selection bias likely influencing longitudinal estimates in anticoagulation-HRQoL research.

Propensity score analysis for a semi-continuous exposure variable: a study of gestational alcohol exposure and childhood cognition	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY			English	Article						causal effect; confounding; generalized propensity score; propensity score; two-part model	PRENATAL ALCOHOL; CAUSAL INFERENCE; BIAS; CHILDREN	Propensity score methodology has become increasingly popular in recent years as a tool for estimating causal effects in observational studies. Much of the related research has been directed at settings with binary or discrete exposure variables with more recent work involving continuous exposure variables. In environmental epidemiology, a substantial proportion of individuals is often completely unexposed while others may experience heavy exposure leading to an exposure distribution with a point mass at zero and a heavy right tail. We suggest a new approach to handle this type of exposure data by constructing a propensity score based on a two-part model and show how this model can be used to more reliably adjust for covariates of a semi-continuous exposure variable. We also consider the case when a misspecified propensity score is used in a regression adjustment and derive an explicit form of the bias. We show that the potential bias gets smaller as the estimated propensity score gets closer to the true expectation of the exposure variable given a set of observed covariates. While this result pertains to a more general setting, we use it to evaluate the potential bias in settings in which the true exposure has a semi-continuous structure. We also evaluate and compare the performance of our proposed method through simulation studies relative to a simpler linear regression-based propensity score for a continuous exposure variable as well as through direct covariate adjustment. Overall, we find that using a propensity score constructed via a two-part model significantly improves the regression estimate when the exposure variable is semi-continuous in nature. Specifically when the proportion of non-exposed subjects is high and the effects of covariates on exposure and outcome are strong, the proposed two-part propensity score method outperforms the more standard competing methods. We illustrate our method using data from the Detroit Longitudinal Cohort Study in which the exposure variable reflects gestational alcohol exposure featuring zero values and a long tail.

Tobacco smoking and cannabis use in a longitudinal birth cohort: Evidence of reciprocal causal relationships	DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE			English	Article						Tobacco; Cannabis; Longitudinal study; Structural equation Modelling	ILLICIT DRUG-USE; SUBSTANCE USE; GATEWAY HYPOTHESIS; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; COMMON LIABILITY; ADOLESCENCE; PROGRESSION; DEPENDENCE; NICOTINE; INITIATION	Background: There is evidence of associations between tobacco and cannabis use that are consistent with both a classical stepping-stone scenario that posits the transition from tobacco use to cannabis use ('gateway' effect of tobacco) and with the reverse process leading from cannabis use to tobacco abuse ('reverse gateway' effect of cannabis). The evidence of direct causal relationships between the two disorders is still missing. Methods: We analysed data from the Christchurch Health and Development Study (CHDS) longitudinal birth cohort using advanced statistical modelling to control for fixed sources of confounding and to explore causal pathways. The data were analysed using both: (a) conditional fixed effects logistic regression modelling; and (b) a systematic structural equation modelling approach previously developed to investigate psychiatric co-morbidities in the same cohort. Results: We found significant (p < 0.05) associations between the extent of cannabis use and tobacco smoking and vice versa, after controlling for non-observed fixed confounding factors and for a number of time-dynamic covariate factors (major depression, alcohol use disorder, anxiety disorder, stressful life events, deviant peer affiliations). Furthermore, increasing levels of tobacco smoking were associated with increasing cannabis use (p = 0.02) and vice versa (p < 0.001) over time. Conclusions: Our results lend support to the notion of both of 'gateway' and 'reverse gateway' effects. That is, the association between tobacco and cannabis use arises from a reciprocal feedback loop involving simultaneous causation between tobacco use disorder and cannabis use disorder.

Confounding by Season in Ecologic Studies of Seasonal Exposures and Outcomes: Examples From Estimates of Mortality Due to Influenza	ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Seasons; Epidemiologic Methods; Models; Statistical; Influenza; Human	TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS; RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS; EXCESS HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS; UNITED-STATES; AIR-POLLUTION; PNEUMONIA; EPIDEMICS; IMPACT; DISEASE; MORBIDITY	PURPOSE: Many health outcomes exhibit seasonal variation in incidence, including accidents, suicides, and infections. For seasonal outcomes it can be difficult to distinguish the causal roles played by factors that also vary seasonally, such as weather, air pollution, and pathogen circulation. METHODS: Various approaches to estimating the association between a seasonal exposure and a seasonal outcome in ecologic Studies are reviewed, using studies of influenza-related mortality as an example. Because mortality rates vary seasonally and circulation of other respiratory viruses peaks during influenza season, it is a challenge to estimate which winter deaths were caused by influenza. Results of studies that estimated the contribution of influenza to all-cause mortality using different methods on the same data are compared. RESULTS: Methods for estimating associations between season exposures and outcomes vary greatly in their advantages, disadvantages, and assumptions. Even when applied to identical data, different methods can give greatly different results for the expected contribution of influenza to all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: When the association between exposures and outcomes that vary seasonally is estimated, models must be selected carefully, keeping in mind the assumptions inherent in each model.

The scenarios that we explored included one with a rare outcome and a strong and prevalent effect measure modifier where, across 1,000 simulated data sets, the estimates from an adjusted logistic regression model (mean beta = 0.475) and an inverse probability of treatment weighted logistic model (mean beta = 2.144) do not coincide with the known true effect (beta = 0.68925) when the effect measure modifier is not accounted for. When the marginal and conditional estimates do not coincide despite a rare outcome this may suggest that there is heterogeneity in the effect of treatment between individuals. Failure to specify effect measure modification in the statistical model appears to results in systematic differences between the conditional and marginal estimates. When these differences in estimates are observed, testing for or including interactions or non-linear modeling terms may be advised.	[Delaney, Joseph A.

There are several factors to consider when evaluating the comparability of data from studies. Regarding the epidemiology literature, issues include choice of study design, use of appropriate controls, methods of exposure assessment, subjective or objective evaluation of neurological status, and assessment and statistical control of potential confounding factors, including co-exposure to other agents. Animal experiments must be evaluated regarding factors such as dose level and duration, procedures used to assess neurological or behavioural status, and appropriateness of inference from the animal model to human neurotoxicity. Major factors that may explain apparent differences between animal and human studies include: animal neurological status may be evaluated with different procedures than those used in humans; animal studies may involve shorter exposure durations and higher dose levels; and most animal studies evaluate a single substance whereas humans typically are exposed to multiple agents. The comparability of measured outcomes in animals and humans may be improved by considering functional domains rather than individual test measures. The application of predictive models, weight of evidence considerations and meta-analysis can help evaluate the consistency of outcomes across studies. An appropriate blend of scientific information from toxicology and epidemiology studies is necessary to evaluate potential human risks of exposure to neurotoxic substances.

Educational Note: Paradoxical collider effect in the analysis of non-communicable disease epidemiological data: a reproducible illustration and web application	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Epidemiological methods; causality; non-communicable disease epidemiology	CAUSAL INFERENCE; SELECTION BIAS; BLOOD-PRESSURE; MODELS; DIAGRAMS; SODIUM; ADULTS; HEALTH	Classical epidemiology has focused on the control of confounding, but it is only recently that epidemiologists have started to focus on the bias produced by colliders. A collider for a certain pair of variables (e.g. an outcome Y and an exposure A) is a third variable (C) that is caused by both. In a directed acyclic graph (DAG), a collider is the variable in the middle of an inverted fork (i.e. the variable C in A -> C <- Y). Controlling for, or conditioning an analysis on a collider (i.e. through stratification or regression) can introduce a spurious association between its causes. This potentially explains many paradoxical findings in the medical literature, where established risk factors for a particular outcome appear protective. We use an example from non-communicable disease epidemiology to contextualize and explain the effect of conditioning on a collider. We generate a dataset with 1000 observations, and run Monte-Carlo simulations to estimate the effect of 24-h dietary sodium intake on systolic blood pressure, controlling for age, which acts as a confounder, and 24-h urinary protein excretion, which acts as a collider. We illustrate how adding a collider to a regression model introduces bias. Thus, to prevent paradoxical associations, epidemiologists estimating causal effects should be wary of conditioning on colliders. We provide R code in easy-to-read boxes throughout the manuscript, and a GitHub repository [https://github.com/migariane/ColliderApp] for the reader to reproduce our example. We also provide an educational web application allowing real-time interaction to visualize the paradoxical effect of conditioning on a collider [http://watzilei.com/shiny/collider/].

Comparing a marginal structural model with a Cox proportional hazard model to estimate the effect of time-dependent drug use in observational studies: statin use for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease as an example from the Rotterdam Study	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Methods; Marginal structural modeling; Time-dependent exposure; Confounding; Observational studies; Cardiovascular disease	RANDOMIZED-TRIALS; HEART; STROKE; NETHERLANDS; OBJECTIVES; EXPOSURE; WOMEN	When studying the causal effect of drug use in observational data, marginal structural modeling (MSM) can be used to adjust for time-dependent confounders that are affected by previous treatment. The objective of this study was to compare traditional Cox proportional hazard models (with and without time-dependent covariates) with MSM to study causal effects of time-dependent drug use. The example of primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) with statins was examined using up to 17.7 years of follow-up from 4,654 participants of the observational prospective population-based Rotterdam Study. In the MSM model, the weight was based on measurements of established cardiovascular risk factors and co-morbidity. In general, we could not demonstrate important differences in results from the Cox models and MSM. Results from analysis on duration of statin use suggested that substantial residual confounding by indication was not accounted for during the period shortly after statin initiation. In conclusion, although on theoretical grounds MSM is an elegant technique, lack of data on the precise time-dependent confounders, such as indication of treatment or other considerations of the prescribing physician jeopardizes the calculation of valid weights. Confounding remains a hurdle in observational effectiveness research on preventive drugs with a multitude of prescription determinants.	[de Keyser, Catherine E.; Leening, Maarten J.

The most obvious way to increase sample size is by pooling scans from independent studies. However, simple pooling is often ill-advised as selection, measurement, and confounding biases may creep in and yield spurious correlations. In this work, we combine 35,320 magnetic resonance images of the brain from 17 studies to examine bias in neuroimaging. In the first experiment, Name That Dataset, we provide empirical evidence for the presence of bias by showing that scans can be correctly assigned to their respective dataset with 71.5% accuracy. Given such evidence, we take a closer look at confounding bias, which is often viewed as the main shortcoming in observational studies. In practice, we neither know all potential confounders nor do we have data on them. Hence, we model confounders as unknown, latent variables. Kolmogorov complexity is then used to decide whether the confounded or the causal model provides the simplest factorization of the graphical model. Finally, we present methods for dataset harmonization and study their ability to remove bias in imaging features. In particular, we propose an extension of the recently introduced ComBat algorithm to control for global variation across image features, inspired by adjusting for unknown population stratification in genetics. Our results demonstrate that harmonization can reduce dataset-specific information in image features. Further, confounding bias can be reduced and even turned into a causal relationship. However, harmonization also requires caution as it can easily remove relevant subject-specific information. Code is available at https://github.com/aimed/Dataset-Bias. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

J	Silan, M; Belloni, P; Boccuzzo, G				Silan, Margherita; Belloni, Pietro; Boccuzzo, Giovanna			Identification of neighborhood clusters on data balanced by a poset-based approach	STATISTICAL METHODS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Neighborhood effect; Balance; Public health; Geographical clusters; Poset	SPATIAL SCAN STATISTICS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; HEALTH; MODELS; WORLD	The identification of territorial clusters where the population suffers from worse health conditions is an important topic in social epidemiology, in order to identify health inequalities in cities and provide health policy interventions. This objective is particularly challenging because of the mechanism of self-selection of individuals into neighborhoods, which causes selection bias. The aim of this paper consists in the identification of neighborhood clusters where elderly people living in Turin, a city in north-western Italy, are exposed to an increased risk of hospitalized fractures. The study is based on administrative data and is a retrospective, observational cohort study. It is composed by a first phase, in which the individual confounding variables are balanced across neighborhoods in order to make them comparable, and a second phase in which the neighborhoods are aggregated into clusters characterized by significantly higher health risk. In the first phase we exploited a balancing technique based on partially ordered sets (poset), called Matching on poset based Average Rank for Multiple Treatments (MARMoT). On the balanced dataset, we used a spatial scan to identify the presence of clusters and we checked whether the risk of fracture is significantly higher in some contiguous areas. The combination of both MARMoT procedure and spatial scan makes it possible to highlight two clusters of neighborhoods in Turin where the risk of incurring hospitalized fractures for elderly people is significantly higher than the mean. These results could have important implications for the implementation of health policies.

J	Greenland, S				Greenland, S			The impact of prior distributions for uncontrolled confounding and response bias: A case study of the relation of wire codes and magnetic fields to childhood leukemia	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Bayesian statistics; confounding; epidermologic methods; leukemia; magnetic fields; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis	VOLTAGE POWER-LINES; ELECTROMAGNETIC-FIELDS; SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS; RISK; CHILDREN; CANCER; EXPOSURE; MISCLASSIFICATION; COLLAPSIBILITY; INFERENCE	This article examines the potential for misleading inferences from conventional analyses and sensitivity analyses of observational data, and describes some proposed solutions based on specifying prior distributions for uncontrolled sources of bias. The issues are illustrated in a sensitivity analysis of confounding in a study of residential wire code and childhood leukemia and in a pooled analysis of 12 studies of magnetic-field measurements and childhood leukemia. Both analyses have been interpreted as evidence in favor of a causal effect of magnetic fields on leukemia risk. This interpretation is contrasted with results from analyses based on prior distributions for the unidentified bias parameters used in the original sensitivity-analysis model. These analyses indicate that accounting for uncontrolled confounding and response bias under a reasonable prior can substantially alter inferences about the existence of a magnetic-field effect. More generally, analyses with informative priors for unidentified bias parameters can help avoid misinterpretation of conventional results and ordinary sensitivity analyses.

Selection of reference groups in the Life Span Study of atomic bomb survivors	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Cancer incidence; Radiation effects; Sensitivity analysis; Unmeasured confounding	DOSE ESTIMATION; RISK-ESTIMATION; CANCER; REGRESSION; CONFOUNDERS; SENSITIVITY; INFERENCE; MORTALITY; NAGASAKI; MODELS	In cohort studies, unbiased estimation of exposure-outcome associations requires selection of an appropriate reference group of unexposed individuals. We illustrate strategies for analyzing cohort data with multiple potential reference groups. We analyzed the association between radiation exposure and incidence of first primary solid cancer among 105,444 participants of the Life Span Study (Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, 1958-2009). Potential reference groups included zero-dose survivors at different ground distances from the hypocenter (internal) and city residents who were not in either city at the time of the bombings (external). DS02R1 weighted absorbed colon doses were estimated by the DS02 dosimetry system. Piecewise constant hazard models estimated excess relative risks of first primary solid cancer. We focused on sex-averaged excess relative risks and the shape of the dose-response curve. A model with internal standardization provided a sex-averaged excess relative risk of 0.510, 95% confidence interval: (0.414, 0.612) per gray of weighted absorbed colon dose, as well as strong evidence of a curvilinear dose response among males (P = 0.008). Selection of not-in-city residents as the reference group resulted in a larger excess relative risk of 0.560, 95% confidence interval: (0.467, 0.657) per gray, and reduced evidence of a curvilinear dose response among males (P = 0.042). These differences were particularly apparent at weighted absorbed colon doses < 1 gray. In cohort studies, selection of an appropriate reference group requires understanding of the nature of unmeasured confounding to which the results could be sensitive.

Testing and Estimating Model-Adjusted Effect-Measure Modification Using Marginal Structural Models and Complex Survey Data	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						health surveys; heterogeneity; interaction; logistic regression; models; statistical; probability weighting; standardization; survey analysis	CAUSAL INFERENCE; RISK; RATIOS	Recently, it has been shown how to estimate model-adjusted risks, risk differences, and risk ratios from complex survey data based on risk averaging and SUDAAN (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina). The authors present an alternative approach based on marginal structural models (MSMs) and SAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina). The authors estimate the parameters of the MSM using inverse weights that are the product of 2 terms. The first term is a survey weight that adjusts the sample to represent the unstandardized population. The second term is an inverse-probability-of-exposure weight that standardizes the population in order to adjust for confounding; it must be estimated using the survey weights. The authors show how to use the MSM parameter estimates and contrasts to test and estimate effect-measure modification; SAS code is provided. They also explain how to program the previous risk-averaging approach in SAS. The 2 methods are applied and compared using data from the 2007 Florida Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey to assess effect modification by age of the difference in risk of cost barriers to health care between persons with disability and persons without disability.

However, in the field of deep semantic segmentation, inference is often unilaterally confounded by the individual attribute of data. Towards cardiovascular signals, quasi-periodicity is the essential characteristic to be learned, regarded as the synthesize of the attributes of morphology (A(m)) and rhythm (A(r)). Our key insight is to suppress the over-dependence on A(m) or A(r) while the generation process of deep representations. To address this issue, we establish a structural causal model as the foundation to customize the intervention approaches on A(m) and A(r), respectively. In this article, we propose contrastive causal intervention (CCI) to form a novel training paradigm under a frame-level contrastive framework. The intervention can eliminate the implicit statistical bias brought by the single attribute and lead to more objective representations. We conduct comprehensive experiments with the controlled condition for QRS location and heart sound segmentation. The final results indicate that our approach can evidently improve the performance by up to 0.41% for QRS location and 2.73% for heart sound segmentation. The efficiency of the proposed method is generalized to multiple databases and noisy signals.

Precision medicine, however, is not only about predicting risks and outcomes, but also about weighing interventions. Interventional clinical predictive models require the correct specification of cause and effect, and the calculation of so-called counterfactuals, that is, alternative scenarios. In biomedical research, observational studies are commonly affected by confounding and selection bias. Without robust assumptions, often requiring a priori domain knowledge, causal inference is not feasible. Data-driven prediction models are often mistakenly used to draw causal effects, but neither their parameters nor their predictions necessarily have a causal interpretation. Therefore, the premise that data-driven prediction models lead to trustable decisions/interventions for precision medicine is questionable. When pursuing intervention modelling, the bio-health informatics community needs to employ causal approaches and learn causal structures. Here we discuss how target trials (algorithmic emulation of randomized studies), transportability (the licence to transfer causal effects from one population to another) and prediction invariance (where a true causal model is contained in the set of all prediction models whose accuracy does not vary across different settings) are linchpins to developing and testing intervention models. Machine learning models are commonly used to predict risks and outcomes in biomedical research. But healthcare often requires information about cause-effect relations and alternative scenarios, that is, counterfactuals. Prosperi et al. discuss the importance of interventional and counterfactual models, as opposed to purely predictive models, in the context of precision medicine.

J	Mertens, K; Vansteelandt, S				Mertens, Karl; Vansteelandt, Stijn			Augmented and doubly robust G-estimation of causal effects under a Structural nested failure time model	BIOMETRICS			English	Article						Augmented estimation; Doubly robust estimation; G-estimation; Inverse probability of censoring weighting; Structural nested accelerated failure time model	INFERENCE; REGRESSION; SURVIVAL	Structural nested failure time models (SNFTMs) are models for the effect of a time-dependent exposure on a survival outcome. They have been introduced along with so-called G-estimation methods to provide valid adjustment for time-dependent confounding induced by time-varying variables. Adjustment for informative censoring in SNFTMs is possible via inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW). In the presence of considerable dropout, this can imply substantial information loss and consequently imprecise effect estimates. In this article, we aim to increase the efficiency of IPCW G-estimators under a SNFTM by deriving an augmented estimator that uses both censored and uncensored observations, and offers robustness against misspecification of the model for the censoring process, provided that a model for a specific functional of the survival time and time-dependent covariates is correctly specified. The empirical properties of the proposed estimators are studied in a simulation experiment, and the estimators are used in the analysis of surveillance data from the field of hospital epidemiology.

When a treatment is prescribed depending on the biomarker, confounding by indication might be introduced if the treatment modifies the marker profile and risk of failure. Objective Our aim was to highlight the flexibility of a two-stage model fitted within a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework. For this purpose, we monitored the prostate-specific antigens in prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiation therapy. In the presence of rising prostate-specific antigens after external beam radiation therapy, salvage hormone therapy can be prescribed to reduce both the prostate-specific antigens concentration and the risk of clinical failure, an illustration of confounding by indication. We focused on the assessment of the prognostic value of hormone therapy and prostate-specific antigens trajectory on the risk of failure. Methods We used a two-stage model within a Bayesian framework to assess the role of the prostate-specific antigens profile on clinical failure while accounting for a secondary treatment prescribed by indication. We modeled prostate-specific antigens using a hierarchical piecewise linear trajectory with a random changepoint. Residual prostate-specific antigens variability was expressed as a function of prostate-specific antigens concentration. Covariates in the survival model included hormone therapy, baseline characteristics, and individual predictions of the prostate-specific antigens nadir and timing and prostate-specific antigens slopes before and after the nadir as provided by the longitudinal process. Results We showed positive associations between an increased prostate-specific antigens nadir, an earlier changepoint and a steeper post-nadir slope with an increased risk of failure. Importantly, we highlighted a significant benefit of hormone therapy, an effect that was not observed when the prostate-specific antigens trajectory was not accounted for in the survival model. Conclusion Our modeling strategy was particularly flexible and accounted for multiple complex features of longitudinal and survival data, including the presence of a random changepoint and a time-dependent covariate.

Gene-environment dependencies lead to collider bias in models with polygenic scores	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; GENOTYPE; METAANALYSIS; PREVENTION	The application of polygenic scores has transformed our ability to investigate whether and how genetic and environmental factors jointly contribute to the variation of complex traits. Modelling the complex interplay between genes and environment, however, raises serious methodological challenges. Here we illustrate the largely unrecognised impact of gene-environment dependencies on the identification of the effects of genes and their variation across environments. We show that controlling for heritable covariates in regression models that include polygenic scores as independent variables introduces endogenous selection bias when one or more of these covariates depends on unmeasured factors that also affect the outcome. This results in the problem of conditioning on a collider, which in turn leads to spurious associations and effect sizes. Using graphical and simulation methods we demonstrate that the degree of bias depends on the strength of the gene-covariate correlation and of hidden heterogeneity linking covariates with outcomes, regardless of whether the main analytic focus is mediation, confounding, or genexcovariate (commonly genexenvironment) interactions. We offer potential solutions, highlighting the importance of causal inference. We also urge further caution when fitting and interpreting models with polygenic scores and non-exogenous environments or phenotypes and demonstrate how spurious associations are likely to arise, advancing our understanding of such results.

Confounder Adjustment Using the Disease Risk Score: A Proposal for Weighting Methods	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						causal inference; confounding; density; disease risk score; epidemiologic methods; weighting	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED PHASE-3; PROPENSITY-SCORE; CAUSAL INFERENCE; ORAL BG-12; STRATIFICATION; ROBUSTNESS; STRATEGIES; EXPOSURE; TRIAL	Propensity score analysis is a common approach to addressing confounding in nonrandomized studies. Its implementation, however, requires important assumptions (e.g., positivity). The disease risk score (DRS) is an alternative confounding score that can relax some of these assumptions. Like the propensity score, the DRS summarizes multiple confounders into a single score, on which conditioning by matching allows the estimation of causal effects. However, matching relies on arbitrary choices for pruning out data (e.g., matching ratio, algorithm, and caliper width) and may be computationally demanding. Alternatively, weighting methods, common in propensity score analysis, are easy to implement and may entail fewer choices, yet none have been developed for the DRS. Here we present 2 weighting approaches: One derives directly from inverse probability weighting; the other, named target distribution weighting, relates to importance sampling. We empirically show that inverse probability weighting and target distribution weighting display performance comparable to matching techniques in terms of bias but outperform them in terms of efficiency (mean squared error) and computational speed (up to >870 times faster in an illustrative study). We illustrate implementation of the methods in 2 case studies where we investigate placebo treatments for multiple sclerosis and administration of aspirin in stroke patients.

On the equivalence of case-crossover and time series methods in environmental epidemiology	BIOSTATISTICS			English	Article						air pollution; case-crossover design; environmental epidemiology; log-linear model; overdispersion; Poisson regression; time series	PARTICULATE AIR-POLLUTION; REFERENT SELECTION; MODELS; EXPOSURES; DESIGNS; BIAS; MORTALITY; FAILURE; HEALTH; TRENDS	The case-crossover design was introduced in epidemiology 15 years ago as a method for studying the effects of a risk factor on a health event using only cases. The idea is to compare a case's exposure immediately prior to or during the case-defining event with that same person's exposure at otherwise similar "reference" times. An alternative approach to the analysis of daily exposure and case-only data is time series analysis. Here, log-linear regression models express the expected total number of events on each day as a function of the exposure level and potential confounding variables. In time series analyses of air pollution, smooth functions of time and weather are the main confounders. Time series and case-crossover methods are often viewed as competing methods. In this paper, we show that case-crossover using conditional logistic regression is a special case of time series analysis when there is a common exposure such as in air pollution studies. This equivalence provides computational convenience for case-crossover analyses and a better understanding of time series models. Time series log-linear regression accounts for overdispersion of the Poisson variance, while case-crossover analyses typically do not.

Our methods formulate complex longitudinal treatments with multiple start/stop switches as the recurrent events with discontinuous intervals of treatment eligibility. We derive the weights in continuous time to handle a complex longitudinal data set without the need to discretise or artificially align the measurement times. We further use machine learning models designed for censored survival data with time-varying covariates and the kernel function estimator of the baseline intensity to efficiently estimate the continuous-time weights. Our simulations demonstrate that the proposed methods provide better bias reduction and nominal coverage probability when analysing observational longitudinal survival data with irregularly spaced time intervals, compared to conventional methods that require aligned measurement time points. We apply the proposed methods to a large-scale COVID-19 data set to estimate the causal effects of several COVID-19 treatments on the composite of in-hospital mortality and intensive care unit (ICU) admission relative to findings from randomised trials.

Typically, for both exposure and outcome, data are available at regular time intervals (e.g. daily pollution levels and daily mortality counts) and the aim is to explore short-term associations between them. In this article, we describe the general features of time series data, and we outline the analysis process, beginning with descriptive analysis, then focusing on issues in time series regression that differ from other regression methods: modelling short-term fluctuations in the presence of seasonal and long-term patterns, dealing with time varying confounding factors and modelling delayed ('lagged') associations between exposure and outcome. We finish with advice on model checking and sensitivity analysis, and some common extensions to the basic model.

Challenging the utility of polygenic scores for social science: Environmental confounding, downward causation, and unknown biology	BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Editorial Material						behavior genetics; environmental confounding; gene-environment correlation; genetic heterogeneity; GWAS; human potential; polygenic scores; population stratification; sociogenomics; statistical genetics	HERITABILITY	The sociogenomics revolution is upon us, we are told. Whether revolutionary or not, sociogenomics is poised to flourish given the ease of incorporating polygenic scores (or PGSs) as "genetic propensities" for complex traits into social science research. Pointing to evidence of ubiquitous heritability and the accessibility of genetic data, scholars have argued that social scientists not only have an opportunity but a duty to add PGSs to social science research. Social science research that ignores genetics is, some proponents argue, at best partial and likely scientifically flawed, misleading, and wasteful. Here, I challenge arguments about the value of genetics for social science and with it the claimed necessity of incorporating PGSs into social science models as measures of genetic influences. In so doing, I discuss the impracticability of distinguishing genetic influences from environmental influences because of non-causal gene-environment correlations, especially population stratification, familial confounding, and downward causation. I explain how environmental effects masquerade as genetic influences in PGSs, which undermines their raison d'etre as measures of genetic propensity, especially for complex socially contingent behaviors that are the subject of sociogenomics. Additionally, I draw attention to the partial, unknown biology, while highlighting the persistence of an implicit, unavoidable reductionist genes versus environments approach. Leaving sociopolitical and ethical concerns aside, I argue that the potential scientific rewards of adding PGSs to social science are few and greatly overstated and the scientific costs, which include obscuring structural disadvantages and cultural influences, outweigh these meager benefits for most social science applications.

Intermediate confounding in trio relationships: The importance of complete data in effect size estimation	GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						bias; confounding; maternal effect; paternal effect; trio		We present an important characteristic of trio models which may lead to bias and loss of power when one parent is unmodeled in trio analyses. Motivated by recent interest in estimating parental effects on postnatal and later-life phenotypes, we consider a causal model where each parent has both an effect on their child's phenotype which is mediated through the genotype transmitted to the child and a direct effect on the phenotype through the parentally provided environment. We derive the power and bias of models in which one parent's genotype is not modeled, showing that while the effect of the child's genotype is biased in the direction of the unmodeled parent's effect as expected, the estimated effect of the observed parent's genotype is also biased in the opposite direction. While this phenomenon may not be intuitive under the assumption of random mating, it can be explained by intermediate confounding of the child's genotype-phenotype effect. These observations have implications for the accurate estimation of maternal and paternal effects in trio data sets with missing genotype data.

In this article, we develop new statistical methods for causal inference based on a single realization of a network of connected units for which neither assumption (i) nor (ii) holds. The proposed approach allows both for arbitrary forms of interference, whereby the outcome of a unit may depend on interventions received by other units with whom a network path through connected units exists; and long range dependence, whereby outcomes for any two units likewise connected by a path in the network may be dependent. Under network versions of consistency and no unobserved confounding, inference is made tractable by an assumption that the networks outcome, treatment and covariate vectors are a single realization of a certain chain graph model. This assumption allows inferences about various network causal effects via theauto-g-computation algorithm, a network generalization of Robins' well-known g-computation algorithm previously described for causal inference under assumptions (i) and (ii).for this article are available online.

Brent			Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology Using Mendelian Randomization: The STROBE-MR Statement	JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Review							CAUSAL INFERENCE	IMPORTANCE Mendelian randomization (MR) studies use genetic variation associated with modifiable exposures to assess their possible causal relationship with outcomes and aim to reduce potential bias from confounding and reverse causation. OBJECTIVE To develop the STROBE-MR Statement as a stand-alone extension to the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guideline for the reporting of MR studies. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The development of the STROBE-MR Statement followed the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) framework guidance and used the STROBE Statement as a starting point to draft a checklist tailored to MR studies. The project was initiated in 2018 by reviewing the literature on the reporting of instrumental variable and MR studies. A group of 17 experts, including MR methodologists, MR study design users, developers of previous reporting guidelines, and journal editors, participated in a workshop in May 2019 to define the scope of the Statement and draft the checklist. The draft checklist was published as a preprint in July 2019 and discussed on the preprint platform, in social media, and at the 4th Mendelian Randomization Conference. The checklist was then revised based on comments, further refined through 2020, and finalized in July 2021. FINDINGS The STROBE-MR checklist is organized into 6 sections (Title and Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, and Other Information) and includes 20 main items and 30 subitems. It covers both 1-sample and 2-sample MR studies that assess 1 or multiple exposures and outcomes, and addresses MR studies that follow a genome-wide association study and are reported in the same article. The checklist asks authors to justify why MR is a helpful method to address the study question and state prespecified causal hypotheses. The measurement, quality, and selection of genetic variants must be described and attempts to assess validity of MR-specific assumptions should be well reported. An item on data sharing includes reporting when the data and statistical code required to replicate the analyses can be accessed. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE STROBE-MR provides guidelines for reporting MR studies. Improved reporting of these studies could facilitate their evaluation by editors, peer reviewers, researchers, clinicians, and other readers, and enhance the interpretation of their results.

The first point is that the-effects of differential variability in the exposure distributions over cases and controls cannot be differentiated from a true quadratic risk model. The second point is that when dealing with variables where zero denotes no exposure, it is important to treat the unexposed subjects separately from those who were exposed. Failure to do so can lead to differential variability among cases and controls and the resulting confounding with a quadratic risk model. Both of these points are illustrated by an example.

The Epidemiology of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease in Asia <i>A Systematic Review and Analysis</i>	PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE JOURNAL			English	Article						hand; foot and mouth disease; EV-A71; CV-A16; epidemiology	ENTEROVIRUS 71 INFECTION; RISK-FACTORS; COXSACKIEVIRUS A16; CLINICAL-FEATURES; MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY; CASE-FATALITY; 2008 OUTBREAK; CHILDREN; TAIWAN; CHINA	Context: Hand, foot and mouth disease (HFMD) is a widespread pediatric disease caused primarily by human enterovirus 71 (EV-A71) and Coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16). Objective: This study reports a systematic review of the epidemiology of HFMD in Asia. Data Sources: PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar were searched up to December 2014. Study Selection: Two reviewers independently assessed studies for epidemiologic and serologic information about prevalence and incidence of HFMD against predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria. Data Extraction: Two reviewers extracted answers for 8 specific research questions on HFMD epidemiology. The results are checked by 3 others. Results: HFMD is found to be seasonal in temperate Asia with a summer peak and in subtropical Asia with spring and fall peaks, but not in tropical Asia; evidence of a climatic role was identified for temperate Japan. Risk factors for HFMD include hygiene, age, gender and social contacts, but most studies were underpowered to adjust rigorously for confounding variables. Both community-level and school-level transmission have been implicated, but their relative importance for HFMD is inconclusive. Epidemiologic indices are poorly understood: No supporting quantitative evidence was found for the incubation period of EV-A71; the symptomatic rate of EV-A71/Coxsackievirus A16 infection was from 10% to 71% in 4 studies; while the basic reproduction number was between 1.1 and 5.5 in 3 studies. The uncertainty in these estimates inhibits their use for further analysis. Limitations: Diversity of study designs complicates attempts to identify features of HFMD epidemiology. Conclusions: Knowledge on HFMD remains insufficient to guide interventions such as the incorporation of an EV-A71 vaccine in pediatric vaccination schedules. Research is urgently needed to fill these gaps.	[Koh, Wee Ming; Siegel, Karen; Jin, Jing; Chen, Mark I.

A study with an aggregate exposure variable. P-E but with outcome, group membership, and covariates assessed individually is partially ecologic. In this paper, P-1, is the proportion exposed; P-E can vary across geographic areas or occupational groups. Methods Several hypothetical scenarios were considered, varying the baseline risk. the exposure effect. the exposure distribution across groups, the impact of the (unmeasured) confounder. and the confounder distribution across groups. First, confounding within groups was introduced, Thereafter, confounding between groups was introduced by co-varying P-E and the confounder prevalence across the groups. The expected odds ratio (exposed versus unexposed) was calculated in two alternative models. the logistic regression and linear odds models, both with P-E as the independent variable. Moreover, empirical data on noise expo, sure and sleeping disturbances were analyzed. Results Compared with the logistic regression model, the linear odds model yielded a markedly less-biased odds ratio (OR) when the outcome was rare ( <= 5% baseline risk). Confounding within groups resulted in marginal bias, whereas confounding between groups resulted in more pronounced bias, Conclusions A logistic regression analysis, with P-E as an independent variable, can yield substantial model misspecification bias. By contrast, the linear odds model is valid when the outcome is rare, Confounding between groups should be of more concern than confounding within groups in partially ecologic analyses,	Univ Lund Hosp, Competence Ctr Clin Res, SE-22185 Lund, Sweden; Lund Univ, Dept Occupat & Environm Med, Lund, Sweden	Lund University; Skane University Hospital; Lund University	Univ Lund Hosp, Competence Ctr Clin Res, SE-22185 Lund, Sweden.

Confounding by Socioeconomic Status in Epidemiological Studies of Air Pollution and Health: Challenges and Opportunities	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES			English	Article							PARTICULATE MATTER; INCOME INEQUALITY; POPULATION HEALTH; SOCIAL-STATUS; CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH; LIFE EXPECTANCY; TERM EXPOSURE; MORTALITY; NEIGHBORHOOD; REGRESSION	BACKGROUND: Despite a vast air pollution epidemiology literature to date and the recognition that lower-socioeconomic status (SES) populations are often disproportionately exposed to pollution, there is little research identifying optimal means of adjusting for confounding by SES in air pollution epidemiology, nor is there a strong understanding of biases that may result from improper adjustment. OBJECTIVE: We aim to provide a conceptualization of SES and a review of approaches to its measurement in the U.S. context and discuss pathways by which SES may influence health and confound effects of air pollution. We explore bias related to measurement and operationalization and identify statistical approaches to reduce bias and confounding. DISCUSSION: Drawing on the social epidemiology, health geography, and economic literatures, we describe how SES, a multifaceted construct operating through myriad pathways, may be conceptualized and operationalized in air pollution epidemiology studies. SES varies across individuals within the contexts of place, time, and culture. Although no single variable or index can fully capture SES, many studies rely on only a single measure. We recommend examining multiple facets of SES appropriate to the study design. Furthermore, investigators should carefully consider the multiple mechanisms by which SES might be operating to identify those SES indicators that may be most appropriate for a given context or study design and assess the impact of improper adjustment on air pollution effect estimates. Last, exploring model contraction and expansion methods may enrich adjustment, whereas statistical approaches, such as quantitative bias analysis, may be used to evaluate residual confounding.

A simple G-computation algorithm to quantify the causal effect of a secondary illness on the progression of a chronic disease	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						marginal structural models; G-computation; causal effect; HIV; AIDS	HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; TIME-VARYING EXPOSURE; HIV SEROCONVERSION; DRUG-USERS; TUBERCULOSIS; INFECTION; SURVIVAL; INFERENCE; RISK; DATE	Progression of a chronic disease can lead to the development of secondary illnesses. An example is the development of active tuberculosis (TB) in HIV-infected individuals. HIV disease progression, as indicated by declining CD4+ T-cell count (CD4), increases both the risk of TB and the risk of AIDS-related mortality. This means that CD4 is a time-dependent confounder for the effect of TB on AIDS-related mortality. Part of the effect of TB on AIDS-related mortality may be indirect by causing a drop in CD4. Estimating the total causal effect of TB on AIDS-related mortality using standard statistical techniques, conditioning on CD4 to adjust for confounding, then gives an underestimate of the true effect. Marginal structural models (MSMs) can be used to obtain an unbiased estimate. We describe an easily implemented algorithm that uses G-computation to fit an MSM, as an alternative to inverse probability weighting (IPW). Our algorithm is simplified by utilizing individual baseline parameters that describe CD4 development. Simulation confirms that the algorithm can produce an unbiased estimate of the effect of a secondary illness, when a marker for primary disease progression is both a confounder and intermediary for the effect of the secondary illness. We used the algorithm to estimate the total causal effect of TB on AIDS-related mortality in HIV-infected individuals, and found a hazard ratio of 3.5 (95 per cent confidence interval 1.2-9.1).

A marginal structural model for multiple-outcome survival data:assessing the impact of injection drug use on several causes of death in the Canadian Co-infection Cohort	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						confounding; competing risks; time-dependent confounding; failure-time data; survival analysis; simulation; multiple-outcome data; longitudinal data; marginal structural models; inverse-probability weighting; intermediate variables; causal inference	ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; MORTALITY; TRANSPLANTATION; INFERENCE; HAZARDS; TIME	It is often the case that interest lies in the effect of an exposure on each of several distinct event types. For example, we are motivated to investigate in the impact of recent injection drug use on deaths due to each of cancer, end-stage liver disease, and overdose in the Canadian Co-infection Cohort (CCC). We develop a marginal structural model that permits estimation of cause-specific hazards in situations where more than one cause of death is of interest. Marginal structural models allow for the causal effect of treatment on outcome to be estimated using inverse-probability weighting under the assumption of no unmeasured confounding; these models are particularly useful in the presence of time-varying confounding variables, which may also mediate the effect of exposures. An asymptotic variance estimator is derived, and a cumulative incidence function estimator is given. We compare the performance of the proposed marginal structural model for multiple-outcome data to that of conventional competing risks models in simulated data and demonstrate the use of the proposed approach in the CCC.

Perspective: Big Data and Machine Learning Could Help Advance Nutritional Epidemiology	ADVANCES IN NUTRITION			English	Article						machine learning; big data; nutritional epidemiology; artificial intelligence; nutritional sciences; diet; nutrition; precision nutrition	PROPENSITY SCORE ESTIMATION; MEASUREMENT ERROR; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; CONFOUNDER CONTROL; NEGATIVE CONTROLS; 24-HOUR RECALL; SELECTION; DIET; RISK	The field of nutritional epidemiology faces challenges posed by measurement error, diet as a complex exposure, and residual confounding. The objective of this perspective article is to highlight how developments in big data and machine learning can help address these challenges. New methods of collecting 24-h dietary recalls and recording diet could enable larger samples and more repeated measures to increase statistical power and measurement precision. In addition, use of machine learning to automatically classify pictures of food could become a useful complimentary method to help improve precision and validity of dietary measurements. Diet is complex due to thousands of different foods that are consumed in varying proportions, fluctuating quantities over time, and differing combinations. Current dietary pattern methods may not integrate sufficient dietary variation, and most traditional modeling approaches have limited incorporation of interactions and nonlinearity. Machine learning could help better model diet as a complex exposure with nonadditive and nonlinear associations. Last, novel big data sources could help avoid unmeasured confounding by offering more covariates, including both omics and features derived from unstructured data with machine learning methods. These opportunities notwithstanding, application of big data and machine learning must be approached cautiously to ensure quality of dietary measurements, avoid overfitting, and confirm accurate interpretations. Greater use of machine learning and big data would also require substantial investments in training, collaborations, and computing infrastructure. Overall, we propose that judicious application of big data and machine learning in nutrition science could offer new means of dietary measurement, more tools to model the complexity of diet and its relations with diseases, and additional potential ways of addressing confounding.

These methods provide the means for calculating the total attributable fraction for a set of exposure variables possibly adjusted for a set of confounding variables. In this paper, a procedure for stepwise calculation of attributable fractions is outlined. The purpose is to study the effect on risk of disease of preventing several exposures, one at a time, in different orderings. This procedure introduces the concepts of sequential and average attributable fractions as aids for attributing the risk of disease to different exposures. The procedure and concepts are illustrated by analyzing data from a cross-sectional study on the prevalence of some frequent symptoms of lung disease.

Causal mediation analyses with rank preserving models	BIOMETRICS			English	Article							PROPHYLAXIS THERAPY	We present a linear rank preserving model (RPM) approach for analyzing mediation of a randomized baseline intervention's effect on a univariate follow-up outcome. Unlike standard mediation analyses, our approach does not assume that the mediating factor is also randomly assigned to individuals in addition to the randomized baseline intervention (i.e., sequential ignorability), but does make several structural interaction assumptions that currently are untestable. The G-estimation procedure for the proposed RPM represents an extension of the work on direct effects of randomized intervention effects for survival outcomes by Robins and Greenland (1994, Journal of the American Statistical Association 89, 737-749) and on intervention non-adherence by Ten Have et al. (2004, Journal of the American Statistical Association 99, 8-16). Simulations show good estimation and confidence interval performance by the proposed RPM approach under unmeasured confounding relative to the standard mediation approach, but poor performance under departures from the structural interaction assumptions. The trade-off between these assumptions is evaluated in the context of two suicide/depression intervention studies.

In previous work van der Laan (2010) and Stitelman and van der Laan (2011a) developed and implemented a closed form targeted maximum likelihood estimator (TMLE) relying on the log-likelihood loss function, and demonstrated important gains relative to inverse probability of treatment weighted estimators and estimating equation based estimators. This TMLE relies on an initial estimator of the entire probability distribution of the longitudinal data structure. To enhance the finite sample performance of the TMLE of the target parameter it is of interest to select the smallest possible relevant part of the data generating distribution, which is estimated and updated by TMLE. Inspired by this goal, we develop a new closed form TMLE of an intervention specific mean outcome based on general longitudinal data structures. The target parameter is represented as an iterative sequence of conditional expectations of the outcome of interest. This collection of conditional means represents the relevant part, which is estimated and updated using the general TMLE algorithm. We also develop this new TMLE for other causal parameters, such as parameters defined by working marginal structural models. The theoretical properties of the TMLE are also practically demonstrated with a small scale simulation study. The proposed TMLE is building upon a previously proposed estimator Bang and Robins (2005) by integrating some of its key and innovative ideas into the TMLE framework.

Reducing bias through directed acyclic graphs	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article							MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; CAUSAL; DEFINITION	Background: The objective of most biomedical research is to determine an unbiased estimate of effect for an exposure on an outcome, i.e. to make causal inferences about the exposure. Recent developments in epidemiology have shown that traditional methods of identifying confounding and adjusting for confounding may be inadequate. Discussion: The traditional methods of adjusting for "potential confounders" may introduce conditional associations and bias rather than minimize it. Although previous published articles have discussed the role of the causal directed acyclic graph approach ( DAGs) with respect to confounding, many clinical problems require complicated DAGs and therefore investigators may continue to use traditional practices because they do not have the tools necessary to properly use the DAG approach. The purpose of this manuscript is to demonstrate a simple 6-step approach to the use of DAGs, and also to explain why the method works from a conceptual point of view. Summary: Using the simple 6-step DAG approach to confounding and selection bias discussed is likely to reduce the degree of bias for the effect estimate in the chosen statistical model.

Tchetgen			Single proxy control	BIOMETRICS			English	Article						confounding proxy; doubly robust; extended propensity score; negative controls; unmeasured confounding	DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES; CAUSAL INFERENCE	Negative control variables are sometimes used in nonexperimental studies to detect the presence of confounding by hidden factors. A negative control outcome (NCO) is an outcome that is influenced by unobserved confounders of the exposure effects on the outcome in view, but is not causally impacted by the exposure. Tchetgen Tchetgen () introduced the Control Outcome Calibration Approach (COCA) as a formal NCO counterfactual method to detect and correct for residual confounding bias. For identification, COCA treats the NCO as an error-prone proxy of the treatment-free counterfactual outcome of interest, and involves regressing the NCO on the treatment-free counterfactual, together with a rank-preserving structural model, which assumes a constant individual-level causal effect. In this work, we establish nonparametric COCA identification for the average causal effect for the treated, without requiring rank-preservation, therefore accommodating unrestricted effect heterogeneity across units. This nonparametric identification result has important practical implications, as it provides single-proxy confounding control, in contrast to recently proposed proximal causal inference, which relies for identification on a pair of confounding proxies. For COCA estimation we propose 3 separate strategies: (i) an extended propensity score approach, (ii) an outcome bridge function approach, and (iii) a doubly-robust approach. Finally, we illustrate the proposed methods in an application evaluating the causal impact of a Zika virus outbreak on birth rate in Brazil.	[Park, Chan; Tchetgen, Eric J.

Overadjustment Bias and Unnecessary Adjustment in Epidemiologic Studies	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							CAUSAL INFERENCE; MORTALITY; DIAGRAMS; MODELS; TRENDS	Overadjustment is defined inconsistently. This term is meant to describe control (eg, by regression adjustment, stratification, or restriction) for a variable that either increases net bias or decreases precision without affecting bias. We define overadjustment bias as control for an intermediate variable (or a descending proxy for an intermediate variable) on a causal path from exposure to outcome. We define unnecessary adjustment as control for a variable that does not affect bias of the causal relation between exposure and outcome but may affect its precision. We use causal diagrams and an empirical example (the effect of maternal smoking on neonatal mortality) to illustrate and clarify the definition of overadjustment bias, and to distinguish overadjustment bias from unnecessary adjustment. Using simulations, we quantify the amount of bias associated with overadjustment. Moreover, we show that this bias is based on a different causal structure from confounding or selection biases. Overadjustment bias is not a finite sample bias, while inefficiencies due to control for unnecessary variables are a function of sample size.

The models and estimation methods have since been extended to dealing with a broader series of problems, and have considerable advantages over the other methods developed for estimating such joint effects. Despite these advantages, the application of these methods in applied research has been relatively infrequent; we view this as unfortunate. To remedy this, we provide an overview of the models and estimation methods as developed, primarily by Robins, over the years. We provide insight into their advantages over other methods, and consider some possible reasons for failure of the methods to be more broadly adopted, as well as possible remedies. Finally, we consider several extensions of the standard models and estimation methods.

Interpreting population- and family-based genome-wide association studies in the presence of confounding	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							GENOTYPE-PHENOTYPE ASSOCIATIONS; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; STRATIFICATION; HERITABILITY; ADMIXTURE; SELECTION; HISTORY; MODEL; RISK	A central aim of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) is to estimate direct genetic effects: the causal effects on an individual's phenotype of the alleles that they carry. However, estimates of direct effects can be subject to genetic and environmental confounding and can also absorb the "indirect" genetic effects of relatives' genotypes. Recently, an important development in controlling for these confounds has been the use of within-family GWASs, which, because of the randomness of mendelian segregation within pedigrees, are often interpreted as producing unbiased estimates of direct effects. Here, we present a general theoretical analysis of the influence of confounding in standard population-based and within-family GWASs. We show that, contrary to common interpretation, family-based estimates of direct effects can be biased by genetic confounding. In humans, such biases will often be small per-locus, but can be compounded when effect-size estimates are used in polygenic scores (PGSs). We illustrate the influence of genetic confounding on population- and family-based estimates of direct effects using models of assortative mating, population stratification, and stabilizing selection on GWAS traits. We further show how family-based estimates of indirect genetic effects, based on comparisons of parentally transmitted and untransmitted alleles, can suffer substantial genetic confounding. We conclude that, while family-based studies have placed GWAS estimation on a more rigorous footing, they carry subtle issues of interpretation that arise from confounding. GWASs aim to estimate direct effects of genotype on an individual's phenotype, but this can be subject to genetic and environmental confounds and "indirect" genetic effects of relatives' genotypes. This study presents a theoretical analysis of the influence of confounders in population-based and within-family GWASs, showing that, while family-based studies are more rigorous, they still carry subtle issues that arise from confounding.

The Future Strikes Back: Using Future Treatments to Detect and Reduce Hidden Bias	SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS & RESEARCH			English	Article						causal inference; confounding; bias; directed acyclic graphs; future treatments	MODELS; INEQUALITY; REGRESSION	Conventional advice discourages controlling for postoutcome variables in regression analysis. By contrast, we show that controlling for commonly available postoutcome (i.e., future) values of the treatment variable can help detect, reduce, and even remove omitted variable bias (unobserved confounding). The premise is that the same unobserved confounder that affects treatment also affects the future value of the treatment. Future treatments thus proxy for the unmeasured confounder, and researchers can exploit these proxy measures productively. We establish several new results: Regarding a commonly assumed data-generating process involving future treatments, we (1) introduce a simple new approach and show that it strictly reduces bias, (2) elaborate on existing approaches and show that they can increase bias, (3) assess the relative merits of alternative approaches, and (4) analyze true state dependence and selection as key challenges. (5) Importantly, we also introduce a new nonparametric test that uses future treatments to detect hidden bias even when future-treatment estimation fails to reduce bias. We illustrate these results empirically with an analysis of the effect of parental income on children's educational attainment.

Using causal inference methodology, we show that the tests and estimators are robust against unmeasured confounding due to population admixture and stratification, provided that Mendel's law of segregation holds and that the considered exposure/treatment variable is not affected by the candidate gene under study. We illustrate the practical relevance of our approach by an application to a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease study. The data analysis suggests a gene-environment interaction between a single nucleotide polymorphism in the Serpine2 gene and smoking status/pack-years of smoking. Simulation studies show that the proposed methodology is sufficiently powered for realistic sample sizes and that it provides valid tests and effect size estimators in the presence of admixture and stratification.

An Assessment of the Cox Proportional Hazards Regression Model for Epidemiologic Studies	RISK ANALYSIS			English	Article						Bias (epidemiology); confounding factors (epidemiology); cox proportional hazards models; mortality; smoking	LUNG-CANCER MORTALITY; PARTICULATE AIR-POLLUTION; MALE BRITISH DOCTORS; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; MULTISTAGE CARCINOGENESIS; UNITED-STATES; TIME-SERIES; EXPOSURE; RISK; HEALTH	The basic assumptions of the Cox proportional hazards regression model are rarely questioned. This study addresses whether hazard ratio, i.e., relative risk (RR), estimates using the Cox model are biased when these assumptions are violated. We investigated also the dependence of RR estimates on temporal exposure characteristics, and how inadequate control for a strong, time-dependent confounder affects RRs for a modest, correlated risk factor. In a realistic cohort of 500,000 adults constructed using the National Cancer Institute Smoking History Generator, we used the Cox model with increasing control of smoking to examine the impact on RRs for smoking and a correlated covariate X. The smoking-associated RR was strongly modified by age. Pack-years of smoking did not sufficiently control for its effects; simultaneous control for effect modification by age and time-dependent cumulative exposure, exposure duration, and time since cessation improved model fit. Even then, residual confounding was evident in RR estimates for covariate X, for which spurious RRs ranged from 0.980 to 1.017 per unit increase. Use of the Cox model to control for a time-dependent strong risk factor yields unreliable RR estimates unless detailed, time-varying information is incorporated in analyses. Notwithstanding, residual confounding may bias estimated RRs for a modest risk factor.

Hence, many pressing medical questions can only be investigated using observational studies. However, direct statistical modeling of observational data can result in biased estimates of treatment effects due to unmeasured confounding. In certain cases, instrumental variable based techniques can be used to remove such biases. These techniques are indeed widely studied and used in econometrics under parametric outcome models, however limited works have focused on the utilization of instrumental variables in survival analysis, where semiparametric models are often necessary. The additional challenge in analyzing survival data is the presence of censoring. In this paper, we introduce an instrumental variable method that relaxes the strong assumptions of previous works and provides consistent estimation of the causal effect of a treatment on a survival outcome. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in various simulated settings and an analysis of Medicare enrollment data comparing two prevalent surgical procedures for abdominal aortic aneurysm from an observational study.

Clinical guidelines consider metabolic syndrome as an all or none medical condition. One proposed method for classifying metabolic syndrome is latent class analysis (LCA). One approach to causal inference in LCA is using propensity score (PS) methods. The aim of this study was to investigate the causal effect of smoking on latent hazard classes of metabolic syndrome using the method of latent class causal analysis.MethodsIn this study, we used data from the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Cohort Study (TLGS). 4857 participants aged over 20 years with complete information on exposure (smoking) and confounders in the third phase (2005-2008) were included. Metabolic syndrome was evaluated as outcome and latent variable in LCA in the data of the fifth phase (2014-2015). The step-by-step procedure for conducting causal inference in LCA included: (1) PS estimation and evaluation of overlap, (2) calculation of inverse probability-of-treatment weighting (IPTW), (3) PS matching, (4) evaluating balance of confounding variables between exposure groups, and (5) conducting LCA using the weighted or matched data set.ResultsBased on the results of IPTW which compared the low, medium and high risk classes of metabolic syndrome (compared to a class without metabolic syndrome), no association was found between smoking and the metabolic syndrome latent classes. PS matching which compared low and moderate risk classes compared to class without metabolic syndrome, showed that smoking increases the probability of being in the low-risk class of metabolic syndrome (OR: 2.19; 95% CI: 1.32, 3.63). In the unadjusted analysis, smoking increased the chances of being in the low-risk (OR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.01, 2.08) and moderate-risk (OR: 1.68; 95% CI: 1.18, 2.40) classes of metabolic syndrome compared to the class without metabolic syndrome.ConclusionsBased on the results, the causal effect of smoking on latent hazard classes of metabolic syndrome can be different based on the type of PS method. In adjusted analysis, no relationship was observed between smoking and moderate-risk and high-risk classes of metabolic syndrome.

Nevertheless, in some settings, such as social networks, infectious disease modeling, and reasoning with spatial and temporal data, this assumption is false. An extensive literature exists on making causal inferences under the iid assumption [17, 11, 26, 21], even when unobserved confounding bias may be present. But, as pointed out in [19], causal inference in non-iid contexts is challenging due to the presence of both unobserved confounding and data dependence. In this paper we develop a general theory describing when causal inferences are possible in such scenarios. We use segregated graphs [20], a generalization of latent projection mixed graphs [28], to represent causal models of this type and provide a complete algorithm for nonparametric identification in these models. We then demonstrate how statistical inference may be performed on causal parameters identified by this algorithm. In particular, we consider cases where only a single sample is available for parts of the model due to full interference, i.e., all units are pathwise dependent and neighbors' treatments affect each others' outcomes [24]. We apply these techniques to a synthetic data set which considers users sharing fake news articles given the structure of their social network, user activity levels, and baseline demographics and socioeconomic covariates.

Toward a better understanding of when to apply propensity scoring: a comparison with conventional regression in ethnic disparities research	ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Propensity scores; Multivariable regression; Marginal effect; Confounding; Effect modification; Reference sample; Disparity	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; CAUSAL INFERENCE; HEALTH; BIAS	Purpose: Despite growing popularity of propensity score (PS) methods used in ethnic disparities studies, many researchers lack clear understanding of when to use PS in place of conventional regression models. One such scenario is presented here: When the relationship between ethnicity and primary care utilization is confounded with and modified by socioeconomic status. Here, standard regression fails to produce an overall disparity estimate, whereas PS methods can through the choice of a reference sample (RS) to which the effect estimate is generalized. Methods: Using data from the National Alcohol Surveys, ethnic disparities between White and Hispanics in access to primary care were estimated using PS methods (PS stratification and weighting), standard logistic regression, and the marginal effects from logistic regression models incorporating effect modification. Results: Whites, Hispanics, and combined White/Hispanic samples were used separately as the RS. Two strategies utilizing PS generated disparities estimates different from those from standard logistic regression, but similar to marginal odd ratios from logistic regression with ethnicity by covariate interactions included in the model. Conclusions: When effect modification is present, PS estimates are comparable with marginal estimates from regression models incorporating effect modification. The estimation process requires a priori hypotheses to guide selection of the RS. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Doubly Robust and Efficient Estimation of Marginal Structural Models for the Hazard Function	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOSTATISTICS			English	Article						targeted maximum likelihood estimation; inverse probability weighting; doubly robust; efficient; marginal structural models	ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; CAUSAL INFERENCE; VIROLOGICAL FAILURE; MORTALITY; COHORT; AIDS	In social and health sciences, many research questions involve understanding the causal effect of a longitudinal treatment on mortality (or time-to-event outcomes in general). Often, treatment status may change in response to past covariates that are risk factors for mortality, and in turn, treatment status may also affect such subsequent covariates. In these situations, Marginal Structural Models (MSMs), introduced by Robins (1997. Marginal structural models Proceedings of the American Statistical Association. Section on Bayesian Statistical Science, 1-10), are well-established and widely used tools to account for time-varying confounding. In particular, a MSM can be used to specify the intervention-specific counterfactual hazard function, i.e. the hazard for the outcome of a subject in an ideal experiment where he/she was assigned to follow a given intervention on their treatment variables. The parameters of this hazard MSM are traditionally estimated using the Inverse Probability Weighted estimation Robins (1999. Marginal structural models versus structural nested models as tools for causal inference. In: Statistical models in epidemiology: the environment and clinical trials. Springer-Verlag, 1999: 95-134), Robins et al. (2000), (IPTW, van der Laan and Petersen (2007. Causal effect models for realistic individualized treatment and intention to treat rules. Int J Biostat 2007; 3: Article 3), Robins et al. (2008. Estimaton and extrapolation of optimal treatment and testing strategies. Statistics in Medicine 2008; 27(23): 4678-721)). This estimator is easy to implement and admits Wald-type confidence intervals. However, its consistency hinges on the correct specification of the treatment allocation probabilities, and the estimates are generally sensitive to large treatment weights (especially in the presence of strong confounding), which are difficult to stabilize for dynamic treatment regimes. In this paper, we present a pooled targeted maximum likelihood estimator (TMLE, van der Laan and Rubin (2006. Targeted maximum likelihood learning. The International Journal of Biostatistics 2006; 2: 1-40)) for MSM for the hazard function under longitudinal dynamic treatment regimes. The proposed estimator is semiparametric efficient and doubly robust, offering bias reduction over the incumbent IPTW estimator when treatment probabilities may be misspecified. Moreover, the substitution principle rooted in the TMLE potentially mitigates the sensitivity to large treatment weights in IPTW. We compare the performance of the proposed estimator with the IPTW and a on-targeted substitution estimator in a simulation study.

J	Taguri, M; Kuchiba, A				Taguri, Masataka; Kuchiba, Aya			Decomposition of the population attributable fraction for two exposures	ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Causal inference; Confounding; Interaction; Population attributable fraction	DOUBLY ROBUST ESTIMATION; RISK; PROBABILITY	Purpose: The population attributable fraction (AF) is frequently used to quantify disease burden attributable to exposures. AF is interpreted as the fractional reduction of disease events that would occur if exposures were eliminated. This article aims to provide a decomposition of the overall AF for two exposures into AFs for each of two exposures and AF for their interaction, using potential outcomes framework. Methods: We provide the decomposition formula with and without confounders. We discuss an estimation method using standard regression models. We also show that these AFs without confounders can be effectively visualized. Results: By a numerical comparison, we show that our decomposition is different from a previous decomposition, which does not have a causal interpretation if confounding exists. We illustrate the proposed decomposition using a large prospective cohort study data. Conclusions: When the primary exposure cannot be modifiable, the interventional interpretation of AF is difficult. Even then, if there exists an interaction between the exposure and another modifiable exposure, our decomposition can show what extent of the effect of the primary exposure can be eliminated by intervening on the modifiable exposure.

To adjust for time-dependent confounding in these settings, longitudinal targeted maximum likelihood based estimation (TMLE), a doubly robust method that can be coupled with machine learning, has been proposed. This paper provides a tutorial in applying longitudinal TMLE, in contrast to inverse probability of treatment weighting and g-computation based on iterative conditional expectations. We apply these methods to estimate the causal effect of nutritional interventions on clinical outcomes among critically ill children in a United Kingdom study (Control of Hyperglycemia in Paediatric Intensive Care, 2008-2011). We estimate the probability of a child's being discharged alive from the pediatric intensive care unit by a given day, under a range of static and dynamic feeding regimes. We find that before adjustment, patients who follow the static regime "never feed" are discharged by the end of the fifth day with a probability of 0.88 (95% confidence interval: 0.87, 0.90), while for the patients who follow the regime "feed from day 3," the probability of discharge is 0.64 (95% confidence interval: 0.62, 0.66). After adjustment for time-dependent confounding, most of this difference disappears, and the statistical methods produce similar results. TMLE offers a flexible estimation approach; hence, we provide practical guidance on implementation to encourage its wider use.

A Case Study of the Impact of Data-Adaptive Versus Model-Based Estimation of the Propensity Scores on Causal Inferences from Three Inverse Probability Weighting Estimators	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOSTATISTICS			English	Article						inverse probability weighting; super learning; propensity score; data-adaptive estimation; marginal structural model	AMERICAN-DIABETES-ASSOCIATION; MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; DEMYSTIFYING DOUBLE ROBUSTNESS; AMBIENT OZONE CONCENTRATIONS; GLUCOSE-CONTROL; ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; EUROPEAN-ASSOCIATION; CONSENSUS STATEMENT; TIME	Objective: Consistent estimation of causal effects with inverse probability weighting estimators is known to rely on consistent estimation of propensity scores. To alleviate the bias expected from incorrect model specification for these nuisance parameters in observational studies, data-adaptive estimation and in particular an ensemble learning approach known as Super Learning has been proposed as an alternative to the common practice of estimation based on arbitrary model specification. While the theoretical arguments against the use of the latter haphazard estimation strategy are evident, the extent to which data-adaptive estimation can improve inferences in practice is not. Some practitioners may view bias concerns over arbitrary parametric assumptions as academic considerations that are inconsequential in practice. They may also be wary of data-adaptive estimation of the propensity scores for fear of greatly increasing estimation variability due to extreme weight values. With this report, we aim to contribute to the understanding of the potential practical consequences of the choice of estimation strategy for the propensity scores in real-world comparative effectiveness research. Method: We implement secondary analyses of Electronic Health Record data from a large cohort of type 2 diabetes patients to evaluate the effects of four adaptive treatment intensification strategies for glucose control ( dynamic treatment regimens) on subsequent development or progression of urinary albumin excretion. Three Inverse Probability Weighting estimators are implemented using both model-based and data-adaptive estimation strategies for the propensity scores. Their practical performances for proper confounding and selection bias adjustment are compared and evaluated against results from previous randomized experiments. Conclusion: Results suggest both potential reduction in bias and increase in efficiency at the cost of an increase in computing time when using Super Learning to implement Inverse Probability Weighting estimators to draw causal inferences.

Challenging the utility of polygenic scores for social science: Environmental confounding, downward causation, and unknown biology	BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						behavior genetics; environmental confounding; gene-environment correlation; genetic heterogeneity; GWAS; human potential; polygenic scores; population stratification; sociogenomics; statistical genetics	GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; SCALE GENETIC-STRUCTURE; STRUCTURAL VARIATION; MISSING HERITABILITY; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; PREDICTION; RISK; RARE; STRATIFICATION; EXPLANATION	The sociogenomics revolution is upon us, we are told. Whether revolutionary or not, sociogenomics is poised to flourish given the ease of incorporating polygenic scores (or PGSs) as "genetic propensities" for complex traits into social science research. Pointing to evidence of ubiquitous heritability and the accessibility of genetic data, scholars have argued that social scientists not only have an opportunity but a duty to add PGSs to social science research. Social science research that ignores genetics is, some proponents argue, at best partial and likely scientifically flawed, misleading, and wasteful. Here, I challenge arguments about the value of genetics for social science and with it the claimed necessity of incorporating PGSs into social science models as measures of genetic influences. In so doing, I discuss the impracticability of distinguishing genetic influences from environmental influences because of non-causal gene-environment correlations, especially population stratification, familial confounding, and downward causation. I explain how environmental effects masquerade as genetic influences in PGSs, which undermines their raison d'etre as measures of genetic propensity, especially for complex socially contingent behaviors that are the subject of sociogenomics. Additionally, I draw attention to the partial, unknown biology, while highlighting the persistence of an implicit, unavoidable reductionist genes versus environments approach. Leaving sociopolitical and ethical concerns aside, I argue that the potential scientific rewards of adding PGSs to social science are few and greatly overstated and the scientific costs, which include obscuring structural disadvantages and cultural influences, outweigh these meager benefits for most social science applications.

We review confounding and mediation in a longitudinal setting and introduce causal graphs to explain the bias that arises from conventional analyses. When both time-varying confounding and mediation are present in the data, traditional regression models result in estimates of effect coefficients that are systematically incorrect, or biased.

J	Das, P; Babadi, B				Das, Proloy; Babadi, Behtash			Non-Asymptotic Guarantees for Reliable Identification of Granger Causality via the LASSO	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY			English	Article						Granger causality; LASSO; autoregressive models; non-asymptotic analysis	VECTOR AUTOREGRESSIVE PROCESSES; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; MODEL SELECTION; TIKHONOV REGULARIZATION; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; VARIABLE SELECTION; LINEAR-DEPENDENCE; SUBSET-SELECTION; REGRESSION; NETWORKS	Granger causality is among the widely used data-driven approaches for causal analysis of time series data with applications in various areas including economics, molecular biology, and neuroscience. Two of the main challenges of this methodology are: 1) over-fitting as a result of limited data duration, and 2) correlated process noise as a confounding factor, both leading to errors in identifying the causal influences. Sparse estimation via the LASSO has successfully addressed these challenges for parameter estimation. However, the classical statistical tests for Granger causality resort to asymptotic analysis of ordinary least squares, which require long data duration to be useful and are not immune to confounding effects. In this work, we address this disconnect by introducing a LASSO-based statistic and studying its non-asymptotic properties under the assumption that the true models admit sparse autoregressive representations. We establish fundamental limits for reliable identification of Granger causal influences using the proposed LASSO-based statistic. We further characterize the false positive error probability and test power of a simple thresholding rule for identifying Granger causal effects and provide two methods to set the threshold in a data-driven fashion. We present simulation studies and application to real data to compare the performance of our proposed method to ordinary least squares and existing LASSO-based methods in detecting Granger causal influences, which corroborate our theoretical results.

A common explanation is collider stratification bias: unmeasured confounding induced by selection bias. Here, we test this supposition through a realistic generative model. Methods: We quantify the collider stratification bias in a selected population using counterfactual causal analysis. We illustrate the bias for a range of scenarios, describing associations between exposure (obesity), outcome (mortality), mediator (in this example, diabetes) and an unmeasured confounder. Results: Collider stratification leads to biased estimation of the causal effect of exposure on outcome. However, the bias is small relative to the causal relationships between the variables. Conclusions: Collider bias can be a partial explanation of the obesity paradox, but unlikely to be the main explanation for a reverse direction of an association to a true causal relationship. Alternative explanations of the obesity paradox should be explored. See Video Abstract at http://links.lww.com/EDE/B51.

The use of propensity score methods with survival or time-to-event outcomes: reporting measures of effect similar to those used in randomized experiments	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						propensity score; observational study; propensity score matching; inverse probability of treatment weighting; survival analysis; event history analysis; confounding; marginal effects	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; INVERSE PROBABILITY; UNTREATED SUBJECTS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; COVARIATE; BALANCE; PERFORMANCE; QUALITY; ABILITY; NUMBER	Propensity score methods are increasingly being used to estimate causal treatment effects in observational studies. In medical and epidemiological studies, outcomes are frequently time-to-event in nature. Propensity-score methods are often applied incorrectly when estimating the effect of treatment on time-to-event outcomes. This article describes how two different propensity score methods (matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting) can be used to estimate the measures of effect that are frequently reported in randomized controlled trials: (i) marginal survival curves, which describe survival in the population if all subjects were treated or if all subjects were untreated; and (ii) marginal hazard ratios. The use of these propensity score methods allows one to replicate the measures of effect that are commonly reported in randomized controlled trials with time-to-event outcomes: both absolute and relative reductions in the probability of an event occurring can be determined. We also provide guidance on variable selection for the propensity score model, highlight methods for assessing the balance of baseline covariates between treated and untreated subjects, and describe the implementation of a sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of unmeasured confounding variables on the estimated treatment effect when outcomes are time-to-event in nature. The methods in the paper are illustrated by estimating the effect of discharge statin prescribing on the risk of death in a sample of patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction. In this tutorial article, we describe and illustrate all the steps necessary to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the effect of treatment on time-to-event outcomes. (c) 2013 The authors.

We aimed to evaluate the effect when accounting for time-dependent confounding affected by previous adherence as well as time sequence between factors. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Finnish healthcare registers. Participants Women aged 45-64years initiating statin use for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in 2001-2004 (n=42807). Outcomes Acute cardiovascular event defined as a composite of acute coronary syndrome and acute ischaemic stroke was our primary outcome. Low-energy fractures were used as a negative control outcome to evaluate the healthy-adherer effect. Results During the 3-year follow-up, 474 women experienced the primary outcome event and 557 suffered a low-energy fracture. The causal HR estimated with marginal structural model for acute cardiovascular events for all the women who remained adherent (proportion of days covered 80%) to statin therapy during the previous adherence assessment year was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.65 to 0.94) when compared with everybody remaining non-adherent (proportion of days covered <80%). The result was robust against alternative model specifications. Statin adherers had a potentially reduced risk of experiencing low-energy fractures compared with non-adherers (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.07). Conclusions Our study, which took into account the time dependence of adherence and confounders, as well as temporal order between these factors, is support for the concept that adherence to statins in women in primary prevention decreases the risk of acute cardiovascular events by about one-fifth in comparison to non-adherence. However, part of the observed effect of statin adherence on acute cardiovascular events may be due to the healthy-adherer effect.

In this systematic review, we evaluated the methodology and reporting quality of individual-level patient data meta-analyses (IPD-MAs) conducted with non-randomized exposures, published in 2009, 2014, and 2019 that sought to estimate a causal relationship in medicine. We screened over 16,000 titles and abstracts, reviewed 45 full-text articles out of the 167 deemed potentially eligible, and included 29 into the analysis. Unfortunately, we found that causal methodologies were rarely implemented, and reporting was generally poor across studies. Specifically, only three of the 29 articles used quasi-experimental methods, and no study used G-methods to adjust for time-varying confounding. To address these issues, we propose stronger collaborations between physicians and methodologists to ensure that causal methodologies are properly implemented in IPD-MAs. In addition, we put forward a suggested checklist of reporting guidelines for IPD-MAs that utilize causal methods. This checklist could improve reporting thereby potentially enhancing the quality and trustworthiness of IPD-MAs, which can be considered one of the most valuable sources of evidence for health policy.

Mortality selection in a genetic sample and implications for association studies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Mortality; genetic epidemiology; genotype	BODY-MASS INDEX; GENOME-WIDE-ASSOCIATION; LIFE; VARIANTS; SMOKING; HEIGHT; CANCER; RISK	Background: Mortality selection occurs when a non-random subset of a population of interest has died before data collection and is unobserved in the data. Mortality selection is of general concern in the social and health sciences, but has received little attention in genetic epidemiology. We tested the hypothesis that mortality selection may bias genetic association estimates, using data from the US-based Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Methods: We tested mortality selection into the HRS genetic database by comparing HRS respondents who survive until genetic data collection in 2006 with those who do not. We next modelled mortality selection on demographic, health and social characteristics to calculate mortality selection probability weights. We analysed polygenic score associations with several traits before and after applying inverse-probability weighting to account for mortality selection. We tested simple associations and time-varying genetic associations (i.e. gene-by-cohort interactions). Results: We observed mortality selection into the HRS genetic database on demographic, health and social characteristics. Correction for mortality selection using inverse probability weighting methods did not change simple association estimates. However, using these methods did change estimates of gene-by-cohort interaction effects. Correction for mortality selection changed gene-by-cohort interaction estimates in the opposite direction from increased mortality selection based on analysis of HRS respondents surviving through 2012. Conclusions: Mortality selection may bias estimates of gene-by-cohort interaction effects. Analyses of HRS data can adjust for mortality selection associated with observables by including probability weights. Mortality selection is a potential confounder of genetic association studies, but the magnitude of confounding varies by trait.

A semi-parametric approach to model-based sensitivity analysis in observational studies	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY			English	Article						estimating equations; observational studies; semi-parametric theory; sensitivity analysis; unmeasured confounding bias	CAUSAL INFERENCE; MATCHING ESTIMATORS; ROBUST ESTIMATION; BIAS; EXOGENEITY; EQUATIONS; VARIABLES; EXPOSURE; DISEASE; CANCER	When drawing causal inference from observational data, there is almost always concern about unmeasured confounding. One way to tackle this is to conduct a sensitivity analysis. One widely used sensitivity analysis framework hypothesises the existence of a scalar unmeasured confounder U and asks how the causal conclusion would change were U measured and included in the primary analysis. Work along this line often makes various parametric assumptions on U, for the sake of mathematical and computational convenience. In this article, we further this line of research by developing a valid sensitivity analysis that leaves the distribution of U unrestricted. Compared to many existing methods in the literature, our method allows for a larger and more flexible family of models, mitigates observable implications, and works seamlessly with any primary analysis that models the outcome regression parametrically. We construct both pointwise confidence intervals and confidence bands that are uniformly valid over a given sensitivity parameter space, thus formally accounting for unknown sensitivity parameters. We apply our proposed method on an influential yet controversial study of the causal relationship between war experiences and political activeness using observational data from Uganda.

They are also the designs of choice for health technology assessment (HTA). Randomization ensures comparability, in both measured and unmeasured pretreatment characteristics, of individuals assigned to treatment and control or comparator. However, even adequately powered RCTs are not always feasible for several reasons such as cost, time, practical and ethical constraints, and limited generalizability. RCTs rely on data collected on selected, homogeneous population under highly controlled conditions; hence, they provide evidence on efficacy of interventions rather than on effectiveness. Alternatively, observational studies can provide evidence on the relative effectiveness or safety of a health technology compared to one or more alternatives when provided under the setting of routine health care practice. In observational studies, however, treatment assignment is a non-random process based on an individual's baseline characteristics; hence, treatment groups may not be comparable in their pretreatment characteristics. As a result, direct comparison of outcomes between treatment groups might lead to biased estimate of the treatment effect. Propensity score approaches have been used to achieve balance or comparability of treatment groups in terms of their measured pretreatment covariates thereby controlling for confounding bias in estimating treatment effects. Despite the popularity of propensity scores methods and recent important methodological advances, misunderstandings on their applications and limitations are all too common.

J	Daly-Grafstein, D; Gustafson, P				Daly-Grafstein, Daniel; Gustafson, Paul			Combining parametric and nonparametric models to estimate treatment effects in observational studies	BIOMETRICS			English	Article						Bayesian methods; causal inference; g-computation; nonparametric	BAYESIAN-ESTIMATION	Performing causal inference in observational studies requires we assume confounding variables are correctly adjusted for. In settings with few discrete-valued confounders, standard models can be employed. However, as the number of confounders increases these models become less feasible as there are fewer observations available for each unique combination of confounding variables. In this paper, we propose a new model for estimating treatment effects in observational studies that incorporates both parametric and nonparametric outcome models. By conceptually splitting the data, we can combine these models while maintaining a conjugate framework, allowing us to avoid the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Approximations using the central limit theorem and random sampling allow our method to be scaled to high-dimensional confounders. Through simulation studies we show our method can be competitive with benchmark models while maintaining efficient computation, and illustrate the method on a large epidemiological health survey.

Optimising the case-crossover design for use in shared exposure settings	EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION			English	Article						Case-crossover study; conditional logistic regression; simulation study	TIME-SERIES; AIR-POLLUTION; LEGIONNAIRES-DISEASE; REFERENT SELECTION; LEGIONELLOSIS RISK; EQUIVALENCE; MODELS; BIAS	With a case-crossover design, a case's exposure during a risk period is compared to the case's exposures at referent periods. The selection of referents for this self-controlled design is determined by the referent selection strategy (RSS). Previous research mainly focused on systematic bias associated with the RSS. We additionally focused on how RSS determines the number of referents per risk, sensitivity to overdispersion and time-varying confounding. We illustrated the consequences of different RSS using a simulation study informed by data on meteorological variables and Legionnaires' disease. By randomising the events and exposure time series, we explored statistical power associated with time-stratified and fixed bidirectional RSS and their susceptibility to systematic bias and confounding bias. In addition, we investigated how a high number of events on the same date (e.g. outbreaks) affected coefficient estimation. As illustrated by our work, referent selection alone can be insufficient to control for a time-varying confounding bias. In contrast to systematic bias, confounding bias can be hard to detect. We studied potential solutions: varying the model parameters and link-function, outlier-removal and aggregating the input-data over smaller areas. Our simulation study offers a framework for researchers looking to detect and to avoid bias in case-crossover studies.

J	Dufort, VM; Infante-Rivard, C				Dufort, VM; Infante-Rivard, C			Housekeeping and safety: An epidemiological review	SAFETY SCIENCE			English	Review						epidemiology; occupational safety; population	CLUSTER RANDOMIZATION; PERFORMANCE	In order to illustrate some basic principles of epidemiology and to suggest how they can be applied to occupational safety studies, articles published between 1967 and 1997 concerned with the association of housekeeping and order to safety in the workplace were reviewed. Population studies were identified through electronic databases and manual searches. Five of the studies were descriptive or exploratory, and cited several factors, including housekeeping, associated with company safety. Four studies were quasi-experimental and showed improvements in safety following changes in various behaviors and conditions, including housekeeping. Design weaknesses were found, significantly compromising the validity of these findings. These included the lack of external comparisons, history and selection bias, and failure to control for confounding. Control for other variables was only done partially through the design, and no attempt to use multivariate statistical models was made. The comments presented in this review should be seen as a base for guiding future studies in occupational safety. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, limited evidence from large cohorts in high-exposure areas and the traditional approach of association assessment may cause residual confounding issues. In this study, we aimed to investigate the causal links between cerebrovascular mortality and long-term exposure to PM2.5, PM10, and PM2.5-10 in an ongoing cohort study with 580,757 participants in southern China. Using satellite-based estimates of PM concentration at a 1-km2 spatial resolution, we assigned exposure levels to each participant and used the marginal structural Cox model to assess the association between PM exposure and cerebrovascular mortality while accounting for time-varying covariates. We also explored the potential modification effects of sociodemographic and behavioral factors on the PM-health associations. Adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for overall cerebrovascular mortality were 1.041 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.034-1.049) and 1.032 (95% CI: 1.026-1.038) for each 1 mu g/m3 increase in PM2.5, and PM10, respectively. Similar trends were observed in the mortality risk from stroke and ischemic stroke, with HRs ranging from 1.040 to 1.069 and 1.025 to 1.052, respectively, across 2 p.m. exposures. The impact of PM exposure was generally more apparent among women, participants with primary school diplomas and below, and the subgroup under low-exposure. Multiple sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. In conclusion, this sizable prospective cohort study hypothesizes causal links between long-term PM exposure and cerebrovascular mortality, particularly among vulnerable participants, supporting the rationale for reducing PM concentration in China to reduce cerebrovascular mortality.

Causal inference of latent classes in complex survey data with the estimating equation framework	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						complex survey; jackknife; latent class exposure; propensity score	SIMPLEX-VIRUS TYPE-2; NATIONAL-HEALTH; UNITED-STATES; VARIABLES; PREVALENCE; INFECTION; MODELS; MEN; CIRCUMCISION; HSV-2	Latent class analysis (LCA) has been effectively used to cluster multiple survey items. However, causal inference with an exposure variable, identified by an LCA model, is challenging because (1) the exposure variable is unobserved and harbors the uncertainty of estimating parameters in the LCA model and (2) confounding bias adjustments need to be done with the unobserved LCA-driven exposure variable. In addition to these challenges, complex survey design features and survey weights must be accounted for if they are present. Our solutions to these issues are to (1) assess point estimates with the expected estimating function approach and (2) modify the survey design weights with LCA-based propensity scores. This paper aims to introduce a statistical procedure to apply the estimating equation approach to assessing the effects of LCA-driven cause in complex survey data using an example of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.

Small area geographical data bring the opportunity of observing health response in a wide variety of exposure values. Temporal sequences of these geographical datasets are crucial to gaining statistical power in detecting factors. The spatiotemporal models required to perform the statistical analysis have to allow for spatial and temporal correlations, which are more easily modelled via hierarchical structures of hidden random factors. These models have produced important research activity during the last decade, the most promising line being Bayesian analysis via Markov chain Monte Carlo. Practical issues without a clear answer still remain. Model comparison is one of those with the most practical relevance. In this article we perform the analysis of hierarchical spatiotemporal models to evaluate the protective effect of calcium and magnesium in drinking water against cerebrovascular mortality. Our data register yearly mortality counts from 1990 to 1995 in a municipality scale but we are not sure which temporal aggregation would be adequate. Many small counts might introduce computational artifacts, leading to inaccurate conclusions. We compare hierarchical models of diverse structure for different temporal aggregation settings via pseudo-Bayes factor and deviance information criteria. We carry out a sensitivity analysis of our main conclusions to ascertain their validity independently of the arbitrary degree of data aggregation and model structure.

Using joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data to investigate the causal effect of salvage therapy after prostatectomy<pag/>	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article; Early Access						Decision making; observational data; time-varying confounding; time-varying treatment; shared parameter model; survival analysis	PROSTATE-CANCER; SURVIVAL	Prostate cancer patients who undergo prostatectomy are closely monitored for recurrence and metastasis using routine prostate-specific antigen measurements. When prostate-specific antigen levels rise, salvage therapies are recommended in order to decrease the risk of metastasis. However, due to the side effects of these therapies and to avoid over-treatment, it is important to understand which patients and when to initiate these salvage therapies. In this work, we use the University of Michigan Prostatectomy Registry Data to tackle this question. Due to the observational nature of this data, we face the challenge that prostate-specific antigen is simultaneously a time-varying confounder and an intermediate variable for salvage therapy. We define different causal salvage therapy effects defined conditionally on different specifications of the longitudinal prostate-specific antigen history. We then illustrate how these effects can be estimated using the framework of joint models for longitudinal and time-to-event data. All proposed methodology is implemented in the freely-available R package JMbayes2.

This cohort has now been studied from birth to the age of 35. This article examines a series of findings from the Christchurch Health and Development Study that address a range of issues relating to the measurement, explanation and prevention of crime and antisocial behaviour. These issues include: center dot The measurement of antisocial behaviour in middle childhood; center dot The effects of maternal smoking during pregnancy on later criminal offending; center dot The long-term consequences of conduct problems, self-control and attention deficits for later crime and delinquency; center dot The role of the marker for the monoamine oxidase (MAOA) genotype in moderating the associations between crime and life course predictors of crime; center dot The development of trajectory models of crime; center dot The use of fixed effects regression in longitudinal analyses to control non-observed sources of confounding; center dot Findings from evaluations of home visiting and parent behaviour management programmes. In general, the findings of the Christchurch Health and Development Study suggest that: (a) conduct problems in childhood and adolescence are a strong and consistent predictor of adult crime; (b) maternal smoking may be an important factor in the development of crime and antisocial behaviour; (c) individuals with the low activity variant of the marker for the MAOA genotype may be at particular risk of criminal offending in adulthood if exposed to environmental risks; (d) the linkages between alcohol misuse and criminal offending are specific to more impulsive kinds of crime such as assault and vandalism; and (e) that home visitation and parent behaviour management programmes may be effective in reducing both child abuse and childhood behaviour problems, amongst other beneficial effects. Two general themes unite this diverse portfolio of findings. The first has been the commitment of the Christchurch Health and Development Study research team to develop, pioneer and apply statistical methods for addressing long-standing issues relating to measurement and causal analysis in developmental data. The second has been the commitment of the group to translating research findings to develop well-evaluated evidence-based programmes.	[Fergusson, David M.; Boden, Joseph M.; Horwood, L.

This paper explains the meaning and importance of epidemiologic bias in public health and discusses how it arises and what can be done to minimize it. Examples of counting participants in a meeting, to which many policy-makers can relate, are used throughout the paper to illustrate bias in general, random error and systematic error, the effect of sample size, the three main categories of bias (selection, information and confounding), stratification and mathematical modeling.

Hemodynamic latency is associated with reduced intelligence across the lifespan: an fMRI DCM study of aging, cerebrovascular integrity, and cognitive ability	BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION			English	Article						Hemodynamic response function; Dynamic causal modeling; Cognition; Cerebrovascular; Vascular dementia; fMRI	CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; BAYESIAN MODEL SELECTION; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; VASCULAR RISK-FACTORS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; SERUM-CHOLESTEROL; APOE GENOTYPE; BRAIN ACTIVATION; PRESSURE; DEMENTIA	Changes in neurovascular coupling are associated with both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia in later life, but this may be confounded by cerebrovascular risk. We hypothesized that hemodynamic latency would be associated with reduced cognitive functioning across the lifespan, holding constant demographic and cerebrovascular risk. In 387 adults aged 18-85 (mean = 48.82), dynamic causal modeling was used to estimate the hemodynamic response function in the left and right V1 and V3-ventral regions of the visual cortex in response to a simple checkerboard block design stimulus with minimal cognitive demands. The hemodynamic latency (transit time) in the visual cortex was used to predict general cognitive ability (Full-Scale IQ), controlling for demographic variables (age, race, education, socioeconomic status) and cerebrovascular risk factors (hypertension, alcohol use, smoking, high cholesterol, BMI, type 2 diabetes, cardiac disorders). Increased hemodynamic latency in the visual cortex predicted reduced cognitive function (p < 0.05), holding constant demographic and cerebrovascular risk. Increased alcohol use was associated with reduced overall cognitive function (Full Scale IQ 2.8 pts, p < 0.05), while cardiac disorders (Full Scale IQ 3.3 IQ pts; p < 0.05), high cholesterol (Full Scale IQ 3.9 pts; p < 0.05), and years of education (2 IQ pts/year; p < 0.001) were associated with higher general cognitive ability. Increased hemodynamic latency was associated with reduced executive functioning (p < 0.05) as well as reductions in verbal concept formation (p < 0.05) and the ability to synthesize and analyze abstract visual information (p < 0.01). Hemodynamic latency is associated with reduced cognitive ability across the lifespan, independently of other demographic and cerebrovascular risk factors. Vascular health may predict cognitive ability long before the onset of dementias.

Adjusting for confounding by indication in observational studies: a case study in traumatic brain injury	CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						confounding; observational studies; traumatic brain injury; instrumental variable analysis; comparative effectiveness research	ACUTE SUBDURAL-HEMATOMA; PROPENSITY SCORE; HEAD-INJURY; MORTALITY; MANAGEMENT; CARE; BIAS; CLASSIFICATION; HEMORRHAGE; GUIDELINES	Introduction: Observational studies of interventions are at risk for confounding by indication. The objective of the current study was to define the circumstances for the validity of methods to adjust for confounding by indication in observational studies. Patients and methods: We performed post hoc analyses of data prospectively collected from three European and North American traumatic brain injury studies including 1,725 patients. The effects of three interventions (intracranial pressure [ICP] monitoring, intracranial operation and primary referral) were estimated in a proportional odds regression model with the Glasgow Outcome Scale as ordinal outcome variable. Three analytical methods were compared: classical covariate adjustment, propensity score matching and instrumental variable (IV) analysis in which the percentage exposed to an intervention in each hospital was added as an independent variable, together with a random intercept for each hospital. In addition, a simulation study was performed in which the effect of a hypothetical beneficial intervention (OR 1.65) was simulated for scenarios with and without unmeasured confounders. Results: For all three interventions, covariate adjustment and propensity score matching resulted in negative estimates of the treatment effect (OR ranging from 0.80 to 0.92), whereas the IV approach indicated that both ICP monitoring and intracranial operation might be beneficial (OR per 10% change 1.17, 95% CI 1.01-1.42 and 1.42, 95% CI 0.95-1.97). In our simulation study, we found that covariate adjustment and propensity score matching resulted in an invalid estimate of the treatment effect in case of unmeasured confounders (OR ranging from 0.90 to 1.03). The IV approach provided an estimate in the similar direction as the simulated effect (OR per 10% change 1.04-1.05) but was statistically inefficient. Conclusion: The effect estimation of interventions in observational studies strongly depends on the analytical method used. When unobserved confounding and practice variation are expected in observational multicenter studies, IV analysis should be considered.

Correlated Biomarker Measurement Error: An Important Threat to Inference in Environmental Epidemiology	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						biomarkers; cadmium; environmental epidemiology; lead; measurement error; reliability	EXPOSURE MEASUREMENT ERROR; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION MODELS; REPRODUCTIVE HORMONES; EXPLANATORY VARIABLES; STRONG CONFOUNDERS; LINEAR-REGRESSION; CADMIUM; LEAD; SUBJECT; MERCURY	Utilizing multiple biomarkers is increasingly common in epidemiology. However, the combined impact of correlated exposure measurement error, unmeasured confounding, interaction, and limits of detection (LODs) on inference for multiple biomarkers is unknown. We conducted data-driven simulations evaluating bias from correlated measurement error with varying reliability coefficients (R), odds ratios (ORs), levels of correlation between exposures and error, LODs, and interactions. Blood cadmium and lead levels in relation to anovulation served as the motivating example, based on findings from the BioCycle Study (20052007). For most scenarios, main-effect estimates for cadmium and lead with increasing levels of positively correlated measurement error created increasing downward or upward bias for OR 1.00 and OR 1.00, respectively, that was also a function of effect size. Some scenarios showed bias for cadmium away from the null. Results subject to LODs were similar. Bias for main and interaction effects ranged from 130 to 36 and from 144 to 84, respectively. A closed-form continuous outcome case solution provides a useful tool for estimating the bias in logistic regression. Investigators should consider how measurement error and LODs may bias findings when examining biomarkers measured in the same medium, prepared with the same process, or analyzed using the same method.

Analytic bounds on causal risk differences in directed acyclic graphs involving three observed binary variables	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL PLANNING AND INFERENCE			English	Article						Causality; Effect decomposition; Confounding; Sensitivity analysis; Bounding; Linear programming; Counterfactual models	INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES; IDENTIFICATION; INFERENCE	We apply a linear programming approach which uses the causal risk difference (RDc) as the objective function and provides minimum and maximum values that RDc can achieve under any set of linear constraints oil the potential response type distribution. We consider two scenarios involving binary exposure X, covariate Z and outcome Y. In the first, Z is not affected by X, and is a potential confounder of the causal effect of X on Y. In the second, Z is affected by X and intermediate in the causal pathway between X and Y. For each scenario we consider various linear constraints corresponding to the presence or absence of arcs in the associated directed acyclic graph (DAG), monotonicity assumptions. and presence or absence of additive-scale interactions. We also estimate Z-stratum-specific bounds when Z is a potential effect measure modifier and bounds for both controlled and natural direct effects when Z is affected by X. In the absence of any additional constraints deriving from background knowledge, the well-known bounds on RDC are duplicated: -Pr(Y not equal X) <= RDC <= Pr(Y = X). These bounds have unit width, but call be narrowed by background knowledge-based assumptions. We provide and compare bounds and bound widths for various combinations of assumptions ill the two scenarios and apply these bounds to real data from two studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is important to note that these types of studies are prone to the issues of reverse causation and residual confounding. Therefore, we conducted a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) study to explore the causality.MethodTo explore the causal relationship between them, this Mendelian randomization (MR) study incorporated summary statistics of dietary salt intake and dementia. We estimated the causality between salt intake and the risk of overall dementia and various subtypes of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Vascular dementia (VaD), and Lewy body dementia (LBD). The inverse variance-weighted (IVW) method was the major MR analysis. To conduct sensitivity analyses, we employed various MR methods, the pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) method, and the leave-one-out approach. The MR-Egger intercept and Cochran's Q test were conducted to test pleiotropy and heterogeneity respectively.ResultsA suggestive association was observed for genetically predicted higher dietary salt intake and increased risk of overall dementia in the European ancestry [odds ratio (OR): 1.542; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.095-2.169; P = 0.013]. The causal relationship between dietary salt intake and overall dementia is robust with respect to the choice of statistical methods and is validated through extensive sensitivity analyses that guard against various model assumption violations. Meanwhile, no clear heterogeneity or pleiotropy was identified. However, we failed to detect a causal effect of dietary salt intake on the risk of various dementia subtypes.ConclusionThe results of this research present strong evidence that established a significant association between dietary salt intake and the likelihood of developing dementia. These findings reinforce the notion that the amount of dietary salt intake plays a crucial role in determining the risk of acquiring this cognitive condition. By establishing a definitive correlation, this study highlights the importance of reducing salt consumption as a preventive measure against dementia.

Propensity score methods, which are commonly used in the pharmacoepidemiology literature, can effectively control for baseline confounding by balancing measured baseline confounders and risk factors and creating comparable populations of treated and untreated patients. Methods: We propose the following 5-step checklist to guide the use and evaluation of propensity score methods: (1) select covariates, (2) assess "Table 1" balance in risk factors before propensity score implementation, (3) estimate and implement the propensity score in the study cohort, (4) reassess "Table 1" balance in risk factors after propensity score implementation, and (5) critically evaluate differences between matched and unmatched patients after propensity score implementation. We then applied this checklist to an endoscopy example using a study cohort of 411 adults with newly diagnosed eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), some of whom were treated with esophageal dilation. Results: We identified 156 patients, aged 18 and older, who were treated with esophageal dilation, and 255 patients who were nondilated. We successfully matched 148 (95%) dilated patients to nondilated patients who had a propensity score within 0.1, based on patient age, sex, race, self-reported food allergy, and presence of narrowing at baseline endoscopy. Crude imbalances were observed before propensity score matching in several baseline covariates, including age, sex, and narrowing; however, propensity score matching was successful in achieving balance across all measured covariates. Conclusions: We provide an introduction to propensity score methods, including a straightforward checklist for implementing propensity score methods in nonexperimental studies of treatment effectiveness. Moreover, we demon-strate the advantage of using "Table 1" as a simple but effective diagnostic tool for evaluating the success of propensity score methods in an applied example of esophageal dilation in EoE.

J	Gruber, S				Gruber, Susan			A Causal Perspective on OSIM2 Data Generation, with Implications for Simulation Study Design and Interpretation	JOURNAL OF CAUSAL INFERENCE			English	Article						DAG; simulation; OMOP; NPSEM		Research by the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) has focused on developing and evaluating strategies to exploit observational electronic data to improve post-market prescription drug surveillance. A data simulator known as OSIM2 developed by the OMOP statistical methods group has been used as a testbed for evaluating and comparing different estimation procedures for detecting adverse drug-related events from data similar to that found in electronic insurance claims data. The simulation scheme produces a longitudinal dataset with millions of observations designed to closely match marginal distributions of important covariates in a known dataset. In this paper we provide a non-parametric structural equation model for the data generating process and construct the associated directed acyclic graph (DAG) depicting the causal structure. These representations reveal key differences between simulated and real-world data, including a departure from longitudinal causal relationships, absence of (presumed) sources of bias and time ordering of covariates that conflicts with reality. The DAG also reveals the presence of unmeasured baseline confounding of the causal effect of a drug on a subsequent medical condition. Conclusions naively drawn from this simulation study could mislead an investigator trying to gain insight into estimator performance on real data. Applying causal inference tools allows us to draw more informed conclusions and suggests modifications to the simulation scheme that would more closely align simulated and real-world data.

Motivated by the Consortium on Safe Labor, a large observational study of obstetric labor practice and birth outcomes, this article focuses on the problem of missing exposure information in a causal analysis of observational data. This problem can be approached from different angles (i.e. missing covariates and causal inference), and useful methods can be obtained by drawing upon the available techniques and insights in both areas. In this article, we describe and compare a collection of methods based on different modeling assumptions, under standard assumptions for missing data (i.e. missing-at-random and positivity) and for causal inference with complete data (i.e. no unmeasured confounding and another positivity assumption). These methods involve three models: one for treatment assignment, one for the dependence of outcome on treatment and covariates, and one for the missing data mechanism. In general, consistent estimation of causal quantities requires correct specification of at least two of the three models, although there may be some flexibility as to which two models need to be correct. Such flexibility is afforded by doubly robust estimators adapted from the missing covariates literature and the literature on causal inference with complete data, and by a newly developed triply robust estimator that is consistent if any two of the three models are correct. The methods are applied to the Consortium on Safe Labor data and compared in a simulation study mimicking the Consortium on Safe Labor.

We propose a two-stage approach for estimating the degree to which such observed associations can be explained by genetic confounding. First, we assess attenuation of exposure effects in regressions controlling for increasingly powerful polygenic scores. Second, we use structural equation models to estimate genetic confounding using heritability estimates derived from both SNP-based and twin-based studies. We examine associations between maternal education and three developmental outcomes-child educational achievement, Body Mass Index, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Polygenic scores explain between 14.3% and 23.0% of the original associations, while analyses under SNP- and twin-based heritability scenarios indicate that observed associations could be almost entirely explained by genetic confounding. Thus, caution is needed when interpreting associations from non-genetically informed epidemiology studies. Our approach, akin to a genetically informed sensitivity analysis can be applied widely. Author summary An objective shared across the life, behavioural, and social sciences is to identify factors that increase risk for a particular disease or trait. However, identifying true risk factors is challenging. Often, a risk factor is statistically associated with a disease even if it is not really relevant, meaning that even successfully improving the risk factor will not impact the disease. One reason for the existence of such misleading associations stems from genetic confounding. This is when genetic factors influence directly both the risk factor and the disease, which generates a statistical association even in the absence of a true effect of the risk factor. Here, we propose a method to estimate genetic confounding and quantify its effect on observed associations. We show that a large part of the associations between maternal education and three child outcomes-educational achievement, body mass index and Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder- is explained by genetic confounding. Our findings can be applied to better understand the role of genetics in explaining associations of key risk factors with diseases and traits.

Unfortunately, the time-varying covariates used to obtain inverse probability weights are often error-prone. Although substantial measurement error in important confounders is known to undermine control of confounders in conventional unweighted regression models, this issue has received comparatively limited attention in the MSM literature. Here we propose a novel application of the simulation-extrapolation (SIMEX) procedure to address measurement error in time-varying covariates, and we compare 2 approaches. The direct approach to SIMEX-based correction targets outcome model parameters, while the indirect approach corrects the weights estimated using the exposure model. We assess the performance of the proposed methods in simulations under different clinically plausible assumptions. The simulations demonstrate that measurement errors in time-dependent covariates may induce substantial bias in MSM estimators of causal effects of time-varying exposures, and that both proposed SIMEX approaches yield practically unbiased estimates in scenarios featuring low-to-moderate degrees of error. We illustrate the proposed approach in a simple analysis of the relationship between sustained virological response and liver fibrosis progression among persons infected with hepatitis C virus, while accounting for measurement error in gamma-glutamyltransferase, using data collected in the Canadian Co-infection Cohort Study from 2003 to 2014.

In the add-on package dagR for the statistical software R, a set of simple graphical rules was implemented to identify minimal sufficient adjustment sets or harmful adjustment. General features: The dagR package allows an automated approach for realistic causal structures featuring numerous variables and dependencies, where a manual approach may be too tedious and error-prone. The algorithmic adherence to the graphical step-by-step approach often used in DAG theory introductory courses, together with functionalities for plotting and simulating data conforming to the causal structure of an arbitrary DAG, renders the dagR package particularly useful for both teaching purposes and methodological research.

Objective: Our study had two aims. First, we aimed to identify essential depression-associated factors using the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning algorithm from big survey data (the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 2012-2016). Second, we aimed to achieve a comprehensive understanding of multifactorial features in depression using network analysis. Methods: An XGBoost model was trained and tested to classify "current depression" and "no lifetime depression" for a data set of 120 variables for 12,596 cases. The optimal XGBoost hyperparameters were set by an automated machine learning tool (TPOT), and a high-performance sparse model was obtained by feature selection using the feature importance value of XGBoost. We performed statistical tests on the model and nonmodel factors using survey-weighted multiple logistic regression and drew a correlation network among factors. We also adopted statistical tests for the confounder or interaction effect of selected risk factors when it was suspected on the network. Results: The XGBoost-derived depression model consisted of 18 factors with an area under the weighted receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.86. Two nonmodel factors could be found using the model factors, and the factors were classified into direct (P<.05) and indirect (P >= .05), according to the statistical significance of the association with depression. Perceived stress and asthma were the most remarkable risk factors, and urine specific gravity was a novel protective factor. The depression-factor network showed clusters of socioeconomic status and quality of life factors and suggested that educational level and sex might be predisposing factors Indirect factors (eg, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and smoking) were involved in confounding or interaction effects of direct factors. Triglyceride level was a confounder of hypercholesterolemia and diabetes, smoking had a significant risk in females, and weight gain was associated with depression involving diabetes. Conclusions: XGBoost and network analysis were useful to discover depression-related factors and their relationships and can be applied to epidemiological studies using big survey data.

However, the impact of ulceration over different subgroups (e.g. AJCC Stage, thickness level) are controversial and its true causal effect on survival is lack of studies in the view of treating ulceration as an exposure. ObjectiveTo explore the true causal effect of ulceration on melanoma's survival by adopting a combination of methods to discover proper adjustment set and confirming its correctness through a variety of means. MethodsA minimal sufficient adjustment set (MSAS) was found using directed acyclic graphs (DAG) to adjust the effect of causality. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to diagnose potential confounders in addition to MSAS. Cox models were built to analyze the causality in-depth and the model was validated using a novel method. Lastly, stratified effects of ulceration were examined to illustrate its impact within subgroups. ResultsHazard ratio (HR) of ulceration after adjustment by MSAS variables was 1.99 (95% CI=1.88-2.09). The sensitivity analysis of propensity score matching and E-value both demonstrated that variables other than MSAS do not have great influence on ulceration and MSS relationship. The HR of ulceration in AJCC Stage, thickness level, invasion level and tumor extension were all monotonically decreased from 5.76 to 1.57, 4.03 to 1.78, 2.75 to 1.78 and 2.65 to 1.71 respectively. ConclusionUlceration in all subgroups were shown to have a significantly negative impact on MSS and its magnitude of effect was monotonically decreased as the disease progressed. The true effect of ulceration can be adjusted by MSAS and its correctness was validated through a variety of approaches.

Accounting for Life-Course Exposures in Epigenetic Biomarker Association Studies: Early Life Socioeconomic Position, Candidate Gene DNA Methylation, and Adult Cardiometabolic Risk	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						epigenetic biomarker; life course; marginal structural models; methylation; time-dependent confounding	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; BIRTH-WEIGHT; IN-UTERO; GLUCOCORTICOID-RECEPTOR; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; MATERNAL SMOKING; HUMAN HYPERTENSION; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; HEALTH; DISEASE	Recent studies suggest that epigenetic programming may mediate the relationship between early life environment, including parental socioeconomic position, and adult cardiometabolic health. However, interpreting associations between early environment and adult DNA methylation may be difficult because of time-dependent confounding by life-course exposures. Among 613 adult women (mean age = 32 years) of the Jerusalem Perinatal Study Family Follow-up (2007-2009), we investigated associations between early life socioeconomic position (paternal occupation and parental education) and mean adult DNA methylation at 5 frequently studied cardiometabolic and stress-response genes (ABCA1, INS-IGF2, LEP, HSD11B2, and NR3C1). We used multivariable linear regression and marginal structural models to estimate associations under 2 causal structures for life-course exposures and timing of methylation measurement. We also examined whether methylation was associated with adult cardiometabolic phenotype. Higher maternal education was consistently associated with higher HSD11B2 methylation (e.g., 0.5%-point higher in 9-12 years vs. <= 8 years, 95% confidence interval: 0.1, 0.8). Higher HSD11B2 methylation was also associated with lower adult weight and total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. We found that associations with early life socioeconomic position measures were insensitive to different causal assumption; however, exploratory analysis did not find evidence for a mediating role of methylation in socioeconomic position-cardiometabolic risk associations.

Studies addressing this issue have produced variable and controversial results. Objectives: We estimate the attributable mortality of VAP in a large multicenter cohort using statistical methods from the field of causal inference. Methods: Patients (n = 4,479) from the longitudinal prospective (1997-2008) French multicenter Outcomerea database were included if they stayed in the intensive care unit (ICU) for at least 2 days and received mechanical ventilation (MV) within 48 hours after ICU admission. A competing risk survival analysis, treating ICU discharge as a competing risk for ICU mortality, was conducted using a marginal structural modeling approach to adjust for time-varying confounding by disease severity. Measurements and Main Results: Six hundred eighty-five (15.3%) patients acquired at least one episode of VAP. We estimated that 4.4% (95% confidence interval, 1.6-7.0%) of the deaths in the ICU on Day 30 and 5.9% (95% confidence interval, 2.5-9.1%) on Day 60 are attributable to VAP. With an observed ICU mortality of 23.3% on Day 30 and 25.6% on Day 60, this corresponds to an ICU mortality attributable to VAP of about 1% on Day 30 and 1.5% on Day 60. Conclusions: Our study on the attributable mortality of VAP is the first that simultaneously accounts for the time of acquiring VAP, informative loss to follow-up after ICU discharge, and the existence of complex feedback relations between VAP and the evolution of disease severity. In contrast to the majority of previous reports, we detected a relatively limited attributable ICU mortality of VAP.

Adapting Text Embeddings for Causal Inference	CONFERENCE ON UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (UAI 2020)	Proceedings of Machine Learning Research		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI)	AUG 03-06, 2020	ELECTR NETWORK					Does adding a theorem to a paper affect its chance of acceptance? Does labeling a post with the author's gender affect the post popularity? This paper develops a method to estimate such causal effects from observational text data, adjusting for confounding features of the text such as the subject or writing quality. We assume that the text suffices for causal adjustment but that, in practice, it is prohibitively high-dimensional. To address this challenge, we develop causally sufficient embeddings, low-dimensional document representations that preserve sufficient information for causal identification and allow for efficient estimation of causal effects. Causally sufficient embeddings combine two ideas. The first is supervised dimensionality reduction: causal adjustment requires only the aspects of text that are predictive of both the treatment and outcome. The second is efficient language modeling: representations of text are designed to dispose of linguistically irrelevant information, and this information is also causally irrelevant. Our method adapts language models (specifically, word embeddings and topic models) to learn document embeddings that are able to predict both treatment and outcome. We study causally sufficient embeddings with semi-synthetic datasets and find that they improve causal estimation over related embedding methods. We illustrate the methods by answering the two motivating questions-the effect of a theorem on paper acceptance and the effect of a gender label on post popularity.

Statistical power in parallel group point exposure studies with time-to-event outcomes: an empirical comparison of the performance of randomized controlled trials and the inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) approach	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Observational study; Propensity score; Inverse probability of treatment weighting; Causal inference; Survival analysis; Randomized controlled trial; Monte Carlo simulations	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; PROPENSITY SCORE METHODS; REGRESSION-MODEL; INFERENCE	Background: Estimating statistical power is an important component of the design of both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. Methods for estimating statistical power in RCTs have been well described and can be implemented simply. In observational studies, statistical methods must be used to remove the effects of confounding that can occur due to non-random treatment assignment. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) using the propensity score is an attractive method for estimating the effects of treatment using observational data. However, sample size and power calculations have not been adequately described for these methods. Methods: We used an extensive series of Monte Carlo simulations to compare the statistical power of an IPTW analysis of an observational study with time-to-event outcomes with that of an analysis of a similarly-structured RCT. We examined the impact of four factors on the statistical power function: number of observed events, prevalence of treatment, the marginal hazard ratio, and the strength of the treatment-selection process. Results: We found that, on average, an IPTW analysis had lower statistical power compared to an analysis of a similarly-structured RCT. The difference in statistical power increased as the magnitude of the treatment-selection model increased. Conclusions: The statistical power of an IPTW analysis tended to be lower than the statistical power of a similarly-structured RCT.

J	Folland, S				Folland, Sherman			Does "community social capital" contribute to population health?	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						USA; social capital; community health	SELF-RATED HEALTH; INCOME INEQUALITY; POLITICAL-ECONOMY; MORTALITY; ASSOCIATION; MULTILEVEL; LEVEL; LIFE; TIES	Robert Putnam showed that a social capital index, created as a weighted sum of 14 variables chosen to describe the civic degree of sociability and community mindedness, is correlated with many community outcomes, such as education, child well-being, crime, and the total mortality rate. Although correlation does not establish causation, we can find that in a large number of studies this index, a selection of its elements, or similar measures register as significantly correlated with health variables, virtually always in a direction consistent with the hypothesis that social capital improves health. The potential benefit of this relationship is substantial, especially if it proves to be robust to differences in time and place, statistical contexts, and ultimately if the relation can be supported to be causal. This paper subjects the social capital and health hypothesis to an expanded set of rigorous tests, which, by surviving, it becomes stronger or, by failing, its weaknesses are better revealed. The paper seeks to extend this body of research by a combination of study characteristics that are each relatively unusual in social capital and health research. Though causality cannot be established by these tests, the work shows that the association of social capital with health is quite robust when challenged in the following ways: (1) seven different health measures are studied, including five mortality rates; (2) the 48 contiguous states are observed at six points in time covering the years from 1978 to 1998 over four year intervals, thus forming a. panel; (3) the multivariate tests feature economic variables from the production of health literature; and (4) a statistical method (instrumental variables) is applied to account for the possibility that omitted variables are confounding the social capital estimates. The results and the discussion find cases for which the social capital and health hypothesis performs only weakly, but, on the whole, the hypothesis is remarkably robust to these variations.

The widely-used rating-scale-based approach for rigidity assessment still depends on the availability of experienced neurologists and is limited by rating subjectivity. Given the recent successful applications of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) in auxiliary PD diagnosis, automated assessment of PD rigidity can be essentially achieved through QSM analysis. However, a major challenge is the performance instability due to the confounding factors (e.g., noise and distribution shift) which conceal the truly-causal features. Therefore, we propose a causality-aware graph convolutional network (GCN) framework, where causal feature selection is combined with causal invariance to ensure that causality-informed model decisions are reached. Firstly, a GCN model that integrates causal feature selection is systematically constructed at three graph levels: node, structure, and representation. In this model, a causal diagram is learned to extract a subgraph with truly-causal information. Secondly, a non-causal perturbation strategy is developed along with an invariance constraint to ensure the stability of the assessment results under different distributions, and thus avoid spurious correlations caused by distribution shifts. The superiority of the proposed method is shown by extensive experiments and the clinical value is revealed by the direct relevance of selected brain regions to rigidity in PD. Besides, its extensibility is verified on other two tasks: PD bradykinesia and mental state for Alzheimer's disease. Overall, we provide a clinically-potential tool for automated and stable assessment of PD rigidity. Our source code will be available at https://github.com/SJTUBME-QianLab/Causality-Aware-Rigidity.

Estimating Response-Maximized Decision Rules With Applications to Breastfeeding	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Causal inference; Confounding; G-estimation; Longitudinal data; Optimal dynamic treatments regimes; Structural Nested Mean Model	TREATMENT STRATEGIES; VARIABLE SELECTION; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; INFANT GROWTH; INFERENCE; DURATION; OUTCOMES; DESIGNS; WEIGHT; MODELS	To estimate the sequence of actions that optimizes response in a longitudinal setting, it is important to study the actions as part of a set of decision rules rather than in a series of single-action comparisons. We take as our motivating example the estimation of the set of decision rules for the duration of breastfeeding with a view to maximizing infant growth. Breastfeeding has many well-recognized beneficial effects on health and development. However observational evidence has suggested that breastfeeding is associated with reduced infant growth, although the long-term consequences for stature and adiposity remain controversial. The Promotion of Breastfeeding Intervention Trial (PROBIT) recruited 17,046 women in which hospitals and their affiliated polyclinics in Belarus were randomized to a breastfeeding promotion intervention or to standard care. In this article, we propose Structural Mean Models and estimate their parameters using G-estimation to obtain unbiased estimates of the effect of continued breastfeeding on infant growth (weight or length) at one year of age. We also implement a modified version of the G-estimation algorithm that is asymptotically unbiased; this is the first real-data application of the algorithm. Finally, we compare the decision rules implied by the G-estimates with the decision implied by a myopic optimization estimation approach, that is, we compare with decision rules that maximize response in the short-term. The breastfeeding regimes selected by each of the three models are optimal in the sense that specific criteria were optimized; the criteria considered here (maximizing weight or length) were chosen for simplicity, but may not lead to better overall health. We demonstrate in the context of a breastfeeding promotion intervention trial that optimal myopic decision strategies do not coincide with strategies that optimize a longer-term response.

Mutual help, including 12-step groups like Alcoholics Anonymous, is often recom-mended as a form of continuing care. However, the effectiveness of 12-step groups is difficult to establish using observational studies due to the risks of selection bias (or confounding). Objective: To address this limitation, we used both conventional and machine learning-based propensity score (PS) methods to examine the effectiveness of 12-step group involvement following inpatient treatment on sub-stance use over a 12-month period. Methods: Using data from the Recovery Journey Project - a longitudinal, observational study - we followed an inpatient sample over 12-months post-treatment to assess the effect of 12-step involvement on substance use at 12-months (n = 254). Specifically, PS models were constructed based on 34 unbalanced confounders and four PS-based methods were applied: matching, inverse probability weighting (IPW), doubly robust (DR) with matching, and DR with IPW. Results: Each PS-based method minimized the potential of confounding from unbalanced variables and demon-strated a significant effect (p < 0.001) between high 12-step involvement (i.e., defined as having a home group; having a sponsor; attending at least one meeting per week; and, being involved in service work) and a reduced likelihood of using substances over the 12-month period (odds ratios 0.11 to 0.32). Conclusions: PS-based methods effectively reduced potential confounding influences and provided robust evi-dence of a significant effect. Nonetheless, results should be considered in light of the relatively high attrition rate, potentially limiting their generalizability.

The propensity score allows one to design and analyze an observational (nonrandomized) study so that it mimics some of the particular characteristics of a randomized controlled trial. In particular, the propensity score is a balancing score: conditional on the propensity score, the distribution of observed baseline covariates will be similar between treated and untreated subjects. I describe 4 different propensity score methods: matching on the propensity score, stratification on the propensity score, inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score, and covariate adjustment using the propensity score. I describe balance diagnostics for examining whether the propensity score model has been adequately specified. Furthermore, I discuss differences between regression-based methods and propensity score-based methods for the analysis of observational data. I describe different causal average treatment effects and their relationship with propensity score analyses.

Causal Mediation Analysis for the Cox Proportional Hazards Model With A Smooth Baseline Hazard Estimator	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Fractional polynomials; Mediation analysis; Mediation formula; Natural indirect effect; Proportional hazards model; Restricted cubic splines; Sensitivity analysis		An important problem within the social, behavioural and health sciences is how to partition an exposure effect (e.g. treatment or risk factor) among specific pathway effects and to quantify the importance of each pathway. Mediation analysis based on the potential outcomes framework is an important tool to address this problem and we consider the estimation of mediation effects for the proportional hazards model. We give precise definitions of the total effect, natural indirect effect and natural direct effect in terms of the survival probability, hazard function and restricted mean survival time within the standard two-stage mediation framework. To estimate the mediation effects on different scales, we propose a mediation formula approach in which simple parametric models (fractional polynomials or restricted cubic splines) are utilized to approximate the baseline log-cumulative-hazard function. Simulation study results demonstrate low bias of the mediation effect estimators and close-to-nominal coverage probability of the confidence intervals for a wide range of complex hazard shapes. We apply this method to the Jackson heart study data and conduct a sensitivity analysis to assess the effect on the mediation effects inference when the no unmeasured mediator-outcome confounding assumption is violated.

Identifying these effects is important for understanding disease etiology and potentially identifying targets for therapeutic intervention. MR uses genetic variants as instrumental variables for the exposure, which should not be influenced by the outcome or confounding variables, overcoming key limitations of traditional epidemiological analyses. For MR to generate a valid estimate of effect, key assumptions must be met. In recent years, there has been a rapid rise in MR methods that aim to test, or are robust to violations of, these assumptions. In this review, we provide an overview of MR for a non-expert audience, including an explanation of these key assumptions and how they are often tested, to aid a better reading and understanding of the MR literature. We highlight some of these new methods and how they can be useful for specific methodological challenges in the musculoskeletal field, including for conditions or traits that share underlying biological pathways, such as bone and joint disease.

Causal mediation analysis for the Cox proportional hazards model with a smooth baseline hazard estimator	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Fractional polynomials; Mediation analysis; Mediation formula; Natural indirect effect; Proportional hazards model; Restricted cubic splines; Sensitivity analysis	SURVIVAL; TIME	An important problem within the social, behavioural and health sciences is how to partition an exposure effect (e.g. treatment or risk factor) among specific pathway effects and to quantify the importance of each pathway. Mediation analysis based on the potential outcomes framework is an important tool to address this problem and we consider the estimation of mediation effects for the proportional hazards model. We give precise definitions of the total effect, natural indirect effect and natural direct effect in terms of the survival probability, hazard function and restricted mean survival time within the standard two-stage mediation framework. To estimate the mediation effects on different scales, we propose a mediation formula approach in which simple parametric models (fractional polynomials or restricted cubic splines) are utilized to approximate the baseline log-cumulative-hazard function. Simulation study results demonstrate low bias of the mediation effect estimators and close-to-nominal coverage probability of the confidence intervals for a wide range of complex hazard shapes. We apply this method to the Jackson heart study data and conduct a sensitivity analysis to assess the effect on the mediation effects inference when the no unmeasured mediator-outcome confounding assumption is violated.

We focus on small-area analyses, encompassing disease mapping, geographic correlation Studies, disease clusters, and clustering. Advances in geographic information systems, statistical methodology, and availability of high-resolution, geographically referenced health and environmental quality data have created unprecedented new opportunities to investigate environmental and other factors in explaining local geographic variations in disease. They also present new challenges. Problems include the large random component that may predominate disease rates across small areas. Though this can be dealt with appropriately using Bayesian statistics to provide smooth estimates of disease risks, sensitivity to detect areas at high risk is limited when expected numbers of cases are small. Potential biases and confounding, particularly due to socioeconomic factors, and a detailed understanding of data quality are important. Data errors can result in large apparent disease excess in a locality. Disease duster reports often arise nonsystematically because of media, physician, or public concern. One ready means of investigating such concerns is the replication of analyses in different areas based on routine data, as is done in the United Kingdom through the Small Area Health Statistics Unit (and increasingly in other European countries, e.g., through the European Health and Environment Information System collaboration). In the future, developments in exposure modeling and mapping, enhanced study designs, and new methods of surveillance of large health databases promise to improve our ability to understand the complex relationships of environment to health.

Over the past 15 years, stratification-based techniques as well as methods such as inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation have been more prominently discussed and offered as a means to correct for selection bias. However, unlike correcting for confounding bias using inverse weighting, uptake of inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation as well as competing methods has been limited in the applied epidemiologic literature. To motivate greater use of inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation and competing methods, we use causal diagrams to describe the sources of selection bias in cohort studies employing a time-to-event framework when the quantity of interest is an absolute measure (e.g., absolute risk, survival function) or relative effect measure (e.g., risk difference, risk ratio). We highlight that whether a given estimate obtained from standard methods is potentially subject to selection bias depends on the causal diagram and the measure. We first broadly describe inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation and then give a simple example to demonstrate in detail how inverse probability-of-censoring weighted estimation mitigates selection bias and describe challenges to estimation. We then modify complex, real-world data from the University of North Carolina Center for AIDS Research HIV clinical cohort study and estimate the absolute and relative change in the occurrence of death with and without inverse probability-of-censoring weighted correction using the modified University of North Carolina data. We provide SAS code to aid with implementation of inverse probability-of-censoring weighted techniques.

Studies estimating excess length of stay (LOS) attributable to nosocomial infections have failed to address-time-varying confounding, likely leading to overestimation of their impact. We present a methodology based on inverse probability-weighted survival curves to address this limitation. Methods. A case study focusing on intensive care unit-acquired bacteremia using data from 2 general intensive care units (ICUs) from 2 London teaching hospitals were used to illustrate the methodology. The area under the curve of a conventional Kaplan-Meier curve applied to the observed data was compared with that of an inverse probability-weighted Kaplan-Meier curve applied after treating bacteremia as censoring events. Weights were based on the daily probability of acquiring bacteremia. The difference between the observed average LOS and the average LOS that would be observed if all bacteremia cases could be prevented was multiplied by the number of admitted patients to obtain the total excess LOS. Results. The estimated total number of extra ICU days caused by 666 bacteremia cases was estimated at 2453 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1803-3103) days. The excess number of days was overestimated when ignoring time-varying confounding (2845 [95% CI, 2276-3415]) or when completely ignoring confounding (2838 [95% CI, 2101-3575]). Conclusions. ICU-acquired bacteremia was associated with a substantial excess LOS. Wider adoption of inverse probabilityweighted survival curves or alternative techniques that address time-varying confounding could lead to better informed decision making around nosocomial infections and other time-dependent exposures.

Although it is not difficult to support the notion of crime as a threat to public health, the difficulty lies in quantifying the impact. Confounding effects of other influential variables (i.e. income, employment, housing) further complicate any analysis into the causal relationships between crime and health. An exploratory spatial data analysis approach was adopted in this study to examine the spatial relationships between crime, health, and quality of life indicators in Super Output Areas (SOAs) in Sheffield (UK). Quantitative methods of spatial data exploration and visualisation, and spatial autocorrelation analysis were used, based on aggregated secondary data drawn from census and crime databases. Statistical models of crime and health were specified, while taking into account the presence of spatial effects by applying spatial regression techniques.

J	Chernozhukov, V; Kasahara, H; Schrimpf, P				Chernozhukov, Victor; Kasahara, Hiroyuki; Schrimpf, Paul			Causal impact of masks, policies, behavior on early covid-19 pandemic in the US	JOURNAL OF ECONOMETRICS			English	Article						Covid-19; Causal impact; Masks; Policies; Behavior	DIAGRAMS; SYSTEMS	The paper evaluates the dynamic impact of various policies adopted by US states on the growth rates of confirmed Covid-19 cases and deaths as well as social distancing behavior measured by Google Mobility Reports, where we take into consideration people's voluntarily behavioral response to new information of transmission risks in a causal structural model framework. Our analysis finds that both policies and information on transmission risks are important determinants of Covid-19 cases and deaths and shows that a change in policies explains a large fraction of observed changes in social distancing behavior. Our main counterfactual experiments suggest that nationally mandating face masks for employees early in the pandemic could have reduced the weekly growth rate of cases and deaths by more than 10 percentage points in late April and could have led to as much as 19 to 47 percent less deaths nationally by the end of May, which roughly translates into 19 to 47 thousand saved lives. We also find that, without stay-at-home orders, cases would have been larger by 6 to 63 percent and without business closures, cases would have been larger by 17 to 78 percent. We find considerable uncertainty over the effects of school closures due to lack of cross-sectional variation; we could not robustly rule out either large or small effects. Overall, substantial declines in growth rates are attributable to private behavioral response, but policies played an important role as well. We also carry out sensitivity analyses to find neighborhoods of the models under which the results hold robustly: the results on mask policies appear to be much more robust than the results on business closures and stay-at-home orders. Finally, we stress that our study is observational and therefore should be interpreted with great caution. From a completely agnostic point of view, our findings uncover predictive effects (association) of observed policies and behavioral changes on future health outcomes, controlling for informational and other confounding variables.

Many of the policies and programmes intended to prevent extinctions operate on the assumption that the factors driving the decline of a population can be determined. Exogenous factors that cause declines in abundance can be statistically confounded with endogenous factors such as density dependence. To demonstrate the potential for confounding, we used an experiment where replicated populations were driven to extinction by gradually manipulating habitat quality. In many of the replicated populations, habitat quality and density dependence were confounded, which obscured causal inference. Our results show that confounding is likely to occur when the exogenous factors that are driving the decline change gradually over time. Our study has direct implications for wild populations, because many factors that could drive a population to extinction change gradually through time.

In such settings, causal analysis requires modeling the joint distribution of exposures given pertinent confounding variables. In the most general setting, this may require modeling the effect of confounding variables on the association between exposures via a second-order regression model. We consider joint modeling of exposures for causal analysis via regression adjustment and inverse weighting. In both frameworks, we also investigate the asymptotic bias of estimators when the dependence model for the generalized propensity score incorrectly assumes conditional independence of exposures or is based on a naive dependence model which does not accommodate the effect of confounders on the conditional association of exposures. We also consider the problem of a semi-continuous bivariate exposure and propose a two-stage estimation technique to study the effects of prenatal alcohol exposure, and the effects of drinking frequency and intensity on childhood cognition.

Researchers tend to use the instrumental variable within one of the three main frameworks: regression with an endogenous variable, principal stratification, or structural-nested modeling. We found in our literature review that even in simple settings, causal interpretations of analyses with endogenous regressors can be ambiguous or rely on a strong assumption that can be difficult to interpret. Principal stratification and structural-nested modeling are alternative frameworks that render unambiguous causal interpretations based on assumptions that are, arguably, easier to interpret. Our interest stems from a wish to estimate the effect of cluster-level adherence on individual-level binary outcomes with a three-armed cluster-randomized trial and polytomous adherence. Principal stratification approaches to this problem are quite challenging because of the sheer number of principal strata involved. Therefore, we developed a structural-nested modeling approach and, in the process, extended the methodology to accommodate cluster-randomized trials with unequal probability of selecting individuals. Furthermore, we developed a method to implement the approach with relatively simple programming. The approach works quite well, but when the structural-nested model does not fit the data, there is no solution to the estimating equation. We investigate the performance of the approach using simulated data, and we also use the approach to estimate the effect on pupil absence of school-level adherence to a randomized water, sanitation, and hygiene intervention in western Kenya.

When a "Confounder" Is Only Measured After Exposure	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Bias; Confounding; Mediation; Observational study	SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; CAUSAL DIAGRAMS; SELECTION BIAS; FORMULAS; MODELS; IMPACT; RISK	Advice regarding the analysis of observational studies of exposure effects usually is against adjustment for factors that occur after the exposure, as they may be caused by the exposure (or mediate the effect of exposure on outcome), so potentially leading to collider stratification bias. However, such factors could also be caused by unmeasured confounding factors, in which case adjusting for them will also remove some of the bias due to confounding. We derive expressions for collider stratification bias when conditioning and confounding bias when not conditioning on the mediator, in the presence of unmeasured confounding (assuming that all associations are linear and there are no interactions). Using simulations, we show that generally neither the conditioned nor the unconditioned estimate is unbiased, and the trade-off between them depends on the magnitude of the effect of the exposure that is mediated relative to the effect of the unmeasured confounders and their relations with the mediator. We illustrate the use of the bias expressions via three examples: neuroticism and mortality (adjusting for the mediator appears the least biased option), glycated hemoglobin levels and systolic blood pressure (adjusting gives smaller bias), and literacy in primary school pupils (not adjusting gives smaller bias). Our formulae and simulations can inform quantitative bias analysis as well as analysis strategies for observational studies in which there is a potential for unmeasured confounding.

We discuss several subtle problems associated with matched case-control studies that do not arise or are minor in matched cohort studies: (1) matching, even for non-confounders, can create selection bias; (2) matching distorts dose-response relations between matching variables and the outcome; (3) unbiased estimation requires accounting for the actual matching protocol as well as for any residual confounding effects; (4) for efficiency, identically matched groups should be collapsed; (5) matching may harm precision and power; (6) matched analyses may suffer from sparse-data bias, even when using basic sparse-data methods. These problems support advice to limit case-control matching to a few strong well-measured confounders, which would devolve to no matching if no such confounders are measured. On the positive side, odds ratio modification by matched variables can be assessed in matched case-control studies without further data, and when one knows either the distribution of the matching factors or their relation to the outcome in the source population, one can estimate and study patterns in absolute rates. Throughout, we emphasize distinctions from the more intuitive impacts of cohort matching.

Multiplicative semiparametric rate-based models are widely used in clinical trials, as are more general partially conditional rate-based models involving event-based stratification. The partially conditional model provides protection against extra-Poisson variation as well as event-dependent censoring, but conditioning on outcomes post-randomization can induce confounding and compromise causal inference. The purpose of this article is to examine the consequences of model misspecification in semiparametric marginal and partially conditional rate-based analysis through omission of prognostic variables. We do so using estimating function theory and empirical studies.

The adoption of this approach helps to identify patients with an elevated risk of eventual death from breast cancer. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study was to examine the associations between both sociodemographic and clinicopathologic characteristics and the underlying risks of death from breast cancer and from other causes for women diagnosed with breast cancer. A second aim was to propose a predictive biomarker of cause-specific mortality in terms of treatment and several important characteristics of a patient. METHODS : A cohort of 16 511 female patients diagnosed with breast cancer in 1990 was obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registries and followed for 20 years. A mixture model for the regression analysis of competing risks was used to identify factors and confounders that affected either the eventual cause-specific mortality or conditional cause-specific hazard rates, or both. Missing data were handled with multiple imputation. RESULTS : Curvilinear relationships of age at diagnosis along with race, marital status, breast cancer type, tumor size, estrogen receptor status, extension, lymph node status, type of surgery, and radiotherapy status were significant risk factors for the cause-specific mortality, with extension and lymph node status appearing to be confounded with the effects of both type of surgery and radiotherapy status. The score obtained from combining a set of predictors showed to be an accurate predictive biomarker. CONCLUSIONS : In cause-specific mortality of women diagnosed breast cancer, prognosis appears to depend on both sociodemographic and clinicopathologic factors. The predictive biomarker proposed in this study may help identifying the level of seriousness of the disease earlier than traditional methods, potentially guiding future allocation of resources for better patient care and management strategies.

Accounting for selection bias due to death in estimating the effect of wealth shock on cognition for the Health and Retirement Study	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Bayesian additive regression trees; causal inference; longitudinal study; missing data; penalized spline of propensity methods in treatment comparisons; time&#8208; dependent confounding		The Health and Retirement Study (HRS) is a longitudinal study of U.S. adults enrolled at age 50 and older. We were interested in investigating the effect of a sudden large decline in wealth on the cognitive ability of subjects measured using a dataset provided composite score. However, our analysis was complicated by the lack of randomization, time-dependent confounding, and a substantial fraction of the sample and population will die during follow-up leading to some of our outcomes being censored. The common method to handle this type of problem is marginal structural models (MSM). Although MSM produces valid estimates, this may not be the most appropriate method to reflect a useful real-world situation because MSM upweights subjects who are more likely to die to obtain a hypothetical population that over time, resembles that would have been obtained in the absence of death. A more refined and practical framework, principal stratification (PS), would be to restrict analysis to the strata of the population that would survive regardless of negative wealth shock experience. In this work, we propose a new algorithm for the estimation of the treatment effect under PS by imputing the counterfactual survival status and outcomes. Simulation studies suggest that our algorithm works well in various scenarios. We found no evidence that a negative wealth shock experience would affect the cognitive score of HRS subjects.

Robust causal inference with continuous instruments using the local instrumental variable curve	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Causal inference; Complier average treatment effect; Cross-validation; Doubly robust methods; Semiparametric theory	MODELS; IDENTIFICATION; POSITIVITY	Instrumental variables are commonly used to estimate effects of a treatment afflicted by unmeasured confounding, and in practice instruments are often continuous (e.g. measures of distance, or treatment preference). However, available methods for continuous instruments have important limitations: they either require restrictive parametric assumptions for identification, or else rely on modelling both the outcome and the treatment process well (and require modelling effect modification by all adjustment covariates). In this work we develop the first semiparametric doubly robust estimators of the local instrumental variable effect curve, i.e. the effect among those who would take treatment for instrument values above some threshold and not below. In addition to being robust to misspecification of either the instrument or treatment or outcome processes, our approach also incorporates information about the instrument mechanism and allows for flexible data-adaptive estimation of effect modification. We discuss asymptotic properties under weak conditions and use the methods to study infant mortality effects of neonatal intensive care units with high versus low technical capacity, using travel time as an instrument.

This includes leveraging RWD in randomized clinical trial (RCT) design and study conduct. In many scenarios, a concurrent control arm may not be viable for ethical or practical considerations, and inclusion of an external control arm can greatly facilitate the decision-making and interpretation of findings. We summarize the strengths and limitations of typical external data sources including historical RCT, aggregated data at study level from literature, patient registry, health insurance claims, electronic health records in terms of fit-for-purpose data selection. To address the inherent confounding due to lack of randomization, propensity score matching method has the advantages of separating the design from analysis and providing the ability to explicitly examine the degree of overlap in confounders. Within the framework of causal inference, however, many alternatives have been proposed with desirable theoretical properties. In this article, we review key steps from study design conceptualization to data source selection, and focus on several methods for evaluation of performance in the context of creating external control for clinical trials. We conducted a focused simulation studies to assess bias reduction and statistical properties when underlying assumptions are violated or models are mis-specified. The results support that analysis using matched group improve bias reduction when sample size is not a limiting factor, and targeted maximum likelihood estimation coupled with super learner is robust when estimating both average treatment effects and average treatment effects among treated.

The meaning of confounding adjustment in the presence of multiple versions of treatment: an application to organ transplantation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Compound treatments; Treatment versions; Transportability; Generalizability; Transplantation	LONG-TERM TREATMENT; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; LIVER; TOXICITY; DONORS	Causal inference for treatments with many versions requires a careful specification of the versions of treatment. Specifically, the existence of multiple relevant versions of treatment has implications for the selection of confounders. To illustrate this, we estimate the effect of organ transplantation using grafts from donors who died due to anoxic drug overdose, on recipient graft survival in the US. We describe how explicitly outlining the target trial (i.e. the hypothetical randomized trial which would answer the causal question of interest) to be emulated by an observational study analysis helps conceptualize treatment versions, guides selection of appropriate adjustment variables, and helps clarify the settings in which causal effects of compound treatments will be of value to decision-makers.

The use of propensity scores and observational data to estimate randomized controlled trial generalizability bias	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						observational studies; randomized controlled trials; sample selection error; propensity score; causal effect	EXTERNAL VALIDITY; EXCLUSION CRITERIA; QUALITY; SAMPLES; DESIGN; ASTHMA	Although randomized controlled trials are considered the gold standard' for clinical studies, the use of exclusion criteria may impact the external validity of the results. It is unknown whether estimators of effect size are biased by excluding a portion of the target population from enrollment. We propose to use observational data to estimate the bias due to enrollment restrictions, which we term generalizability bias. In this paper, we introduce a class of estimators for the generalizability bias and use simulation to study its properties in the presence of non-constant treatment effects. We find the surprising result that our estimators can be unbiased for the true generalizability bias even when all potentially confounding variables are not measured. In addition, our proposed doubly robust estimator performs well even for mis-specified models. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

While randomized clinical trials (RCT) usually provide the dearest answers, they are often not done or not practicable. More than a decade after the introduction of calcium channel blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, clinical trial data about their effect on major disease endpoints in patients with hypertension are still not available. The primary alternatives are the use of randomized trials that include surrogate endpoints, such as level of blood pressure or extent of carotid atherosclerosis, and the use of observational studies that include major disease endpoints. Both approaches, their strengths and limitations, are discussed in detail. The possibility of residual confounding limits the strength of inferences that can be drawn from observational studies. Similarly, the possibility of important drug effects, other than those involving the surrogate endpoint, limits the inferences that can be drawn from randomized trials that rely solely on surrogate outcomes as guides to therapy. In the absence of evidence from large clinical trials that include major disease endpoints, treatment decisions and guidelines need to synthesize the best available information from a variety of sources. Consistency of findings across various study designs, outcomes, and populations is critical to the practice of evidence-based medicine and the effort to maximize the health benefits of antihypertensive therapies.

One key feature of the model is the combination of propensity score matching to balance confounding variables between the two living arrangement groups-to reduce bias due to unbalanced covariates at baseline, with a pattern-mixture model for longitudinal data-to deal with non-ignorable dropout. A fully Bayesian approach allows us to convey the uncertainty in the estimation of the propensity score and subsequent matching in the inference of the causal effect of interest. The analysis conducted adds to previous studies in the literature concerning the protective effect of living with someone, by proposing a modelling approach treating living arrangement as an exposure.

We present a theoretical study of an (in)direct effect decomposition of the population intervention effect, defined by stochastic interventions jointly applied to the exposure and mediators. In contrast to existing proposals, our causal effects can be evaluated regardless of whether an exposure is categorical or continuous and remain well-defined even in the presence of intermediate confounders affected by exposure. Our (in)direct effects are identifiable without a restrictive assumption on cross-world counterfactual independencies, allowing for substantive conclusions drawn from them to be validated in randomized controlled trials. Beyond the novel effects introduced, we provide a careful study of nonparametric efficiency theory relevant for the construction of flexible, multiply robust estimators of our (in)direct effects, while avoiding undue restrictions induced by assuming parametric models of nuisance parameter functionals. To complement our nonparametric estimation strategy, we introduce inferential techniques for constructing confidence intervals and hypothesis tests, and discuss open-source software, the medshift R package, implementing the proposed methodology. Application of our (in)direct effects and their nonparametric estimators is illustrated using data from a comparative effectiveness trial examining the direct and indirect effects of pharmacological therapeutics on relapse to opioid use disorder.

Estimating the marginal effect of a continuous exposure on an ordinal outcome using data subject to covariate-driven treatment and visit processes	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						confounding; marginal odds ratio; outcome-dependent follow-up times; suicide attempts; video games	REGRESSION-MODELS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; SCREEN TIME; VIDEO GAME; INTERVENTIONS; DEPRESSION; BIAS	In the statistical literature, a number of methods have been proposed to ensure valid inference about marginal effects of variables on a longitudinal outcome in settings with irregular monitoring times. However, the potential biases due to covariate-driven monitoring times and confounding have rarely been considered simultaneously, and never in a setting with an ordinal outcome and a continuous exposure. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a methodology for causal inference in such a setting, relying on a proportional odds model to study the effect of the exposure on the outcome. Irregular observation times are considered via a proportional rate model, and a generalization of inverse probability of treatment weights is used to account for the continuous exposure. We motivate our methodology by the estimation of the marginal (causal) effect of the time spent on video or computer games on suicide attempts in the Add Health study, a longitudinal study in the United States. Although in the Add Health data, observation times are prespecified, our proposed approach is applicable even in more general settings such as when analyzing data from electronic health records where observations are highly irregular. In simulation studies, we let observation times vary across individuals and demonstrate that not accounting for biasing imbalances due to the monitoring and the exposure schemes can bias the estimate for the marginal odds ratio of exposure.

Control of confounding, however, remains challenging. The authors compared five methods for evaluating the effect of tissue plasminogen activator on death among 6,269 ischemic stroke patients registered in a German stroke registry: multivariable logistic regression, propensity score-matched analysis, regression adjustment with the propensity score, and two propensity score-based weighted methods-one estimating the treatment effect in the entire study population (inverse-probability-of-treatment weights), another in the treated population (standardized-mortality-ratio weights). Between 2000 and 2001, 212 patients received tissue plasminogen activator. The crude odds ratio between tissue plasminogen activator and death was 3.35 (95% confidence interval: 2.28, 4.91). The adjusted odds ratio depended strongly on the adjustment method, ranging from 1.11 (95% confidence interval: 0.67, 1.84) for the standardized-mortality-ratio weighted to 10.77 (95% confidence interval: 2.47, 47.04) for the inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighted analysis. For treated patients with a low propensity score, risks of dying were high. Exclusion of patients with a propensity score of <5% yielded comparable odds ratios of approximately 1 for all methods. High levels of nonuniform treatment effect render summary estimates very sensitive to the weighting system explicit or implicit in an adjustment technique. Researchers need to be clear about the population for which an overall treatment estimate is most suitable.

We hereby assessed the casual relationship between long-term PM (PM2.5, PM10 and PM10-2.5) exposure and COPD mortality in a large cohort of Chinese adults using state-of-the-art causal inference approaches.Methods: A total of 580,757 participants in southern China were enrolled in a prospective cohort study from 2009 to 2015 and followed up until December 2020. Exposures to PM at each residential address were obtained from the Long-term Gap-free High-resolution Air Pollutant Concentration dataset. Marginal structural Cox models were used to investigate the association between COPD mortality and annual average exposure levels of PM exposure.Results: During an average follow-up of 8.0 years, 2250 COPD-related deaths occurred. Under a set of causal inference assumptions, the hazard ratio (HR) for COPD mortality was estimated to be 1.046 (95 % confidence interval: 1.034-1057), 1.037 (1.028-1.047), and 1.032 (1.006-1.058) for each 1-mu g/m3 increase in annual average concentra-tions of PM2.5, PM10, and PM10-2.5 respectively. Additionally, the detrimental effects appeared to be more pronounced among the elderly (age >= 65) and inactive participants. The effect estimates of PM2.5, PM10, and PM10-2.5 tend to be greater among participants who were generally exposed to PM10 concentrations below 70 mu g/m3 than that among the general population.Conclusion: Our results support causal links between long-term PM exposure and COPD mortality, highlighting the urgency for more effective strategies to reduce PM exposure, with particular attention on protecting potentially vulner-able groups.

Methods: To complement a recent causal inference analysis, which concluded that G-tube placement increases the hazard of death, permanent assisted ventilation, or tracheostomy by 28%, we fit causal inference models on a different sample of 481 patients with ALS enrolled in a recent clinical trial of ceftriaxone. Forward selection identified predictors of G-tube placement. Effects of G-tube on survival and QOL were estimated using structural nested models and marginal structural models, accounting for predictors of G-tube treatment. Results: Forced vital capacity and the total score and bulbar subscale of the revised ALS Functional Rating Scale best predicted G-tube placement. Correcting for these confounders, G-tube placement decreased survival time by 46% (p < 0.001) and had no effect on QOL (p = 0.078). Sensitivity survival analyses varied in significance, but none revealed a survival benefit. Conclusions: In the absence of randomization, causal inference methods are necessary to correct for time-varying confounding. G-tube placement may have a negative effect on survival with no QOL-related benefit for people with ALS. A randomized controlled trial is warranted to further evaluate the efficacy of this widely used intervention. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class III evidence that for patients with ALS, G-tube placement decreases survival time and does not affect QOL.

The authors recently introduced propensity score calibration (PSC), which combines propensity scores and regression calibration to address confounding by variables unobserved in the main study by using variables observed in a validation study. Here, the authors assess the performance of PSC using simulations in settings with and without violation of the key assumption of PSC: that the error-prone propensity score estimated in the main study is a surrogate for the gold-standard propensity score (i.e., it contains no additional information on the outcome). The assumption can be assessed if data on the outcome are available in the validation study. If data are simulated allowing for surrogacy to be violated, results depend largely on the extent of violation. If surrogacy holds, PSC leads to bias reduction between 32% and 106% (> 100% representing overcorrection). If surrogacy is violated, PSC can lead to an increase in bias. Surrogacy is violated when the direction of confounding of the exposure-disease association caused by the unobserved variable(s) differs from that of the confounding due to observed variables. When surrogacy holds, PSC is a useful approach to adjust for unmeasured confounding using validation data.

We use an instrumental variable approach to address the potential unmeasured confounding between the fertility decision and psychological health, where the instrumental variable is an index of the intensity of the implementation of the policy. We establish an analytical link between the local instrumental variable approach and principal stratification to accommodate the continuous instrumental variable. Within the principal stratification framework, we postulate a Bayesian hierarchical model to infer various causal estimands of policy interest while adjusting for the clustering data structure. We apply the method to the data from the China Family Panel Studies and find small but statistically significant negative effects of being an only child on self-reported psychological health for some subpopulations. Our analysis reveals treatment effect heterogeneity with respect to both observed and unobserved characteristics. In particular, urban males suffer the most from being only children, and the negative effect has larger magnitude if the families were more resistant to the one-child policy. We also conduct a sensitivity analysis to assess the key instrumental variable assumption.

An application of propensity score weighting to quantify the causal effect of rectal sexually transmitted infections on incident HIV among men who have sex with men	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article						STI; HIV; Propensity scores; Survival analysis; Men who have sex with men; Marginal structural models	PREEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS; TRANSGENDER WOMEN; RISK; DISEASES; TRANSMISSION; PREVENTION; BALANCE	Background: Exploring causal associations in HIV research requires careful consideration of numerous epidemiologic limitations. First, a primary cause of HIV, unprotected anal intercourse (UAI), is time-varying and, if it is also associated with an exposure of interest, may be on a confounding path. Second, HIV is a rare outcome, even in high-risk populations. Finally, for most causal, non-preventive exposures, a randomized trial is impossible. In order to address these limitations and provide a practical illustration of efficient statistical control via propensity-score weighting, we examine the causal association between rectal STI and HIV acquisition in the InvolveMENt study, a cohort of Atlanta-area men who have sex with men (MSM). We hypothesized that, after controlling for potentially confounding behavioral and demographic factors, the significant STI-HIV association would attenuate, but yield an estimate of the causal effect. Methods: The exposure of interest was incident rectal gonorrhea or chlamydia infection; the outcome was incident HIV infection. To adjust for behavioral confounding, while accounting for limited HIV infections, we used an inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) Cox proportional hazards (PH) model for incident HIV. Weights were derived from propensity score modeling of the probability of incident rectal STI as a function of potential confounders, including UAI in the interval of rectal STI acquisition/censoring. Results: Of 556 HIV-negative MSM at baseline, 552 (99%) men were included in this analysis. 79 men were diagnosed with an incident rectal STI and 26 with HIV. 6 HIV-infected men were previously diagnosed with a rectal STI. In unadjusted analysis, incident rectal STI was significantly associated with subsequent incident HIV (HR (95%CI): 3.6 (1.4-9.2)). In the final weighted and adjusted model, the association was attenuated and more precise (HR (95%CI): 2.7 (1.2-6.4)). Conclusions: We found that, controlling for time-varying risk behaviors and time-invariant demographic factors, diagnosis with HIV was significantly associated with prior diagnosis of rectal CT or GC. Our analysis lends support to the causal effect of incident rectal STI on HIV diagnosis and provides a framework for similar analyses of HIV incidence.

Matched cohort and case-control study designs are commonly implemented to control for confounding effects without specifying the functional form of the relationship between the outcome and confounders. This paper extends the commonly used regression models in matched designs for binary and survival outcomes (i.e. conditional logistic and stratified Cox proportional hazards) to studies of continuous outcomes through a novel interpretation and application of logit-based regression models from the econometrics and marketing research literature. We compare the performance of the maximum likelihood estimators using simulated data and propose a heuristic argument for obtaining the residuals for model diagnostics. We illustrate our proposed approach with two real data applications. Our simulation studies demonstrate that our stratification approach is robust to model misspecification and that the distribution of the estimated residuals provides a useful diagnostic when the strata are of moderate size. In our applications to real data, we demonstrate that parity and menopausal status are associated with percent mammographic density, and that the mean level and variability of inpatient blood glucose readings vary between medical and surgical wards within a national tertiary hospital. Our work highlights how the same class of regression models, available in most statistical software, can be used to adjust for confounding in the study of binary, time-to-event and continuous outcomes.

J	Månsson, R; Joffe, MM; Sun, WG; Hennessy, S				Mansson, Roger; Joffe, Marshall M.; Sun, Wenguang; Hennessy, Sean			On the estimation and use of propensity scores in case-control and case-cohort studies	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						bias (epidemiology); case-control studies; cohort studies; confounding factors (epidemiology); epidemiologic methods; models; statistical; propensity score	LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; STRATIFICATION; MODELS	The use of propensity scores to adjust for measured confounding factors has become increasingly popular in cohort studies. However, their use in case-control and case-cohort studies has received little attention. The authors present some theory on the estimation and use of propensity scores in case-control and case-cohort studies and present the results of simulation studies that examine whether large-sample expectations are realized in studies of typical size. The application of propensity scores is less straightforward in case-control and case-cohort studies than in cohort studies. The authors' simulations revealed two potentially important issues. First, when using several potential approaches, there is artifactual effect modification of the odds ratio by level of propensity score. The magnitude of this phenomenon decreases as the sample size increases. Second, several potential approaches produce estimated propensity scores that do not converge to the true value as sample size increases and, thus, can fail to adjust fully for measured confounding factors. However, the magnitude of residual confounding appeared modest in our simulations. Researchers considering using propensity scores in case-control or case-cohort studies should consider the potential for artifactual effect modification and their reduced ability to control for potential confounding factors.

Applying multiple regression models including the effects of treatment and covariates on outcome is the well-known classical approach to adjust for confounding. In recent years other approaches have been promoted. One of them is based on the propensity score and considers the effect of possible confounders on treatment as a relevant criterion for adjustment. Another proposal is based on using an instrumental variable. Here inference relies on a factor, the instrument, which affects treatment but is thought to be otherwise unrelated to outcome, so that it mimics randomization. Each of these approaches can basically be interpreted as a simple reweighting scheme, designed to address confounding. The procedures will be compared with respect to their fundamental properties, namely, which bias they aim to eliminate, which effect they aim to estimate, and which parameter is modelled. We will expand our overview of methods for analysis of non-randomized studies to methods for analysis of randomized controlled trials and show that analyses of both study types may target different effects and different parameters. The considerations will be illustrated using a breast cancer study with a so-called Comprehensive Cohort Study design, including a randomized controlled trial and a non-randomized study in the same patient population as sub-cohorts. This design offers ideal opportunities to discuss and illustrate the properties of the different approaches.

This review seeks to provide an overview of several conventional designs, including cohort, case-control and more recently applied non-conventional designs such as family-based designs. We also discuss some practical points regarding the application and interpretation of family-based designs. Methods: Definitions of each design, the study population, the exposure and the outcome measures are briefly summarised. Examples of study designs are taken from the field of low birth-weight research for illustrative purposes. Also examined are relative advantages and disadvantages of each design in terms of assumptions, potential selection and information bias, confounding and generalisability. Kinship data linkage, statistical models and result interpretation are discussed specific to family-based designs. Results: When all information is retrieved from registers, there is no evident preference of the case-control design over the cohort design to estimate odds ratios. All conventional designs included in the review are prone to bias, particularly due to residual confounding. Family-based designs are able to reduce such bias and strengthen causal inference. In the field of low birth-weight research, family-based designs have been able to confirm a negative association not confounded by genetic or shared environmental factors between low birth weight and the risk of asthma. Conclusions: We conclude that there is a broader need for family-based design in observational research as evidenced by the meaningful contributions to the understanding of the potential causal association between low birth weight and subsequent outcomes.

EPIC-Inter Act Consortium	Network Mendelian randomization: using genetic variants as instrumental variables to investigate mediation in causal pathways	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Mendelian randomization; mediation; instrumental variable; direct effect; indirect effect	SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; WEAK INSTRUMENTS; BIAS; IDENTIFICATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; INFERENCE; GENOMICS; SMOKING; COHORT	Background: Mendelian randomization uses genetic variants, assumed to be instrumental variables for a particular exposure, to estimate the causal effect of that exposure on an outcome. If the instrumental variable criteria are satisfied, the resulting estimator is consistent even in the presence of unmeasured confounding and reverse causation. Methods: We extend the Mendelian randomization paradigm to investigate more complex networks of relationships between variables, in particular where some of the effect of an exposure on the outcome may operate through an intermediate variable (a mediator). If instrumental variables for the exposure and mediator are available, direct and indirect effects of the exposure on the outcome can be estimated, for example using either a regression-based method or structural equation models. The direction of effect between the exposure and a possible mediator can also be assessed. Methods are illustrated in an applied example considering causal relationships between body mass index, C-reactive protein and uric acid. Results: These estimators are consistent in the presence of unmeasured confounding if, in addition to the instrumental variable assumptions, the effects of both the exposure on the mediator and the mediator on the outcome are homogeneous across individuals and linear without interactions. Nevertheless, a simulation study demonstrates that even considerable heterogeneity in these effects does not lead to bias in the estimates. Conclusions: These methods can be used to estimate direct and indirect causal effects in a mediation setting, and have potential for the investigation of more complex networks between multiple interrelated exposures and disease outcomes.

J	Cao, SL; Qin, HZ; Deng, HW; Wang, YP				Cao, Shaolong; Qin, Huaizhen; Deng, Hong-Wen; Wang, Yu-Ping			A Unified Sparse Representation for Sequence Variant Identification for Complex Traits	GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						sparse regression; relatedness; population structure; prior biological information; Mexican Americans	POPULATION-STRUCTURE; GENETIC-VARIANTS; ASSOCIATION; HYPERTENSION; RARE; REGULARIZATION; SELECTION; RISK; COMMON	Joint adjustment of cryptic relatedness and population structure is necessary to reduce bias in DNA sequence analysis; however, existent sparse regression methods model these two confounders separately. Incorporating prior biological information has great potential to enhance statistical power but such information is often overlooked in many existent sparse regression models. We developed a unified sparse regression (USR) to incorporate prior information and jointly adjust for cryptic relatedness, population structure, and other environmental covariates. Our USR models cryptic relatedness as a random effect and population structure as fixed effect, and utilize the weighted penalties to incorporate prior knowledge. As demonstrated by extensive simulations, our USR algorithm can discover more true causal variants and maintain a lower false discovery rate than do several commonly used feature selection methods. It can handle both rare and common variants simultaneously. Applying our USR algorithm to DNA sequence data of Mexican Americans from GAW18, we replicated three hypertension pathways, demonstrating the effectiveness in identifying susceptibility genetic variants.

This bias can be eliminated by acknowledging a change in treatment exposure status with time-dependent analyses, such as fitting a time-dependent Cox model. The prescription time-distribution matching (PTDM) method has been proposed as a simpler approach for controlling immortal time bias. Using simulation studies and theoretical quantification of bias, we compared the performance of the PTDM approach with that of the time-dependent Cox model in the presence of immortal time. Both assessments revealed that the PTDM approach did not adequately address immortal time bias. Based on our simulation results, another recently proposed observational data analysis technique, the sequential Cox approach, was found to be more useful than the PTDM approach (Cox: bias = -0.002, mean squared error = 0.025; PTDM: bias = -1.411, mean squared error = 2.011). We applied these approaches to investigate the association of beta-interferon treatment with delaying disability progression in a multiple sclerosis cohort in British Columbia, Canada (Long-Term Benefits and Adverse Effects of Beta-Interferon for Multiple Sclerosis (BeAMS) Study, 1995-2008).

J	Garner, C				Garner, Chad			Confounded by Sequencing Depth in Association Studies of Rare Alleles	GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						case-control study; next-generation DNA sequencing; false-positive association; genome-wide association	GENETIC-ASSOCIATION; COMMON DISEASES; GENOME; VARIANTS; REGRESSION	Next-generation DNA sequencing technologies are facilitating large-scale association studies of rare genetic variants. The depth of the sequence read coverage is an important experimental variable in the next-generation technologies and it is a major determinant of the quality of genotype calls generated from sequence data. When case and control samples are sequenced separately or in different proportions across batches, they are unlikely to be matched on sequencing read depth and a differential misclassification of genotypes can result, causing confounding and an increased false-positive rate. Data from Pilot Study 3 of the 1000 Genomes project was used to demonstrate that a difference between the mean sequencing read depth of case and control samples can result in false-positive association for rare and uncommon variants, even when the mean coverage depth exceeds 30 x in both groups. The degree of the confounding and inflation in the false-positive rate depended on the extent to which the mean depth was different in the case and control groups. A logistic regression model was used to test for association between case-control status and the cumulative number of alleles in a collapsed set of rare and uncommon variants. Including each individual's mean sequence read depth across the variant sites in the logistic regression model nearly eliminated the confounding effect and the inflated false-positive rate. Furthermore, accounting for the potential error by modeling the probability of the heterozygote genotype calls in the regression analysis had a relatively minor but beneficial effect on the statistical results.

The detection of whether these parasites are significantly associated is important in medicine and epidemiology. Numerous approaches to detect associations are available, but only a few provide statistical tests. Furthermore, they generally test for an overall detection of association and do not identify which parasite is associated with which other one. Here, we developed a new approach, the association screening approach, to detect the overall and the detail of multi-parasite associations. We studied the power of this new approach and of three other known ones (i.e., the generalized chi-square, the network and the multinomial GLM approaches) to identify parasite associations either due to parasite interactions or to confounding factors. We applied these four approaches to detect associations within two populations of multi-infected hosts: (1) rodents infected with Bartonella sp., Babesia microfi and Anaplasma phagocytophilum and (2) bovine population infected with Theileria sp. and Babesia sp. We found that the best power is obtained with the screening model and the generalized chi-square test. The differentiation between associations, which are due to confounding factors and parasite interactions was not possible. The screening approach significantly identified associations between Bartonella doshiae and B. microti, and between T parva, T mutans, and T velifera. Thus, the screening approach was relevant to test the overall presence of parasite associations and identify the parasite combinations that are significantly over- or under-represented. Unraveling whether the associations are due to real biological interactions or confounding factors should be further investigated. Nevertheless, in the age of genomics and the advent of new technologies, it is a considerable asset to speed up researches focusing on the mechanisms driving interactions between parasites.

A flexible approach for causal inference with multiple treatments and clustered survival outcomes	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Bayesian machine learning; multilevel survival data; observational studies; sensitivity analysis	PROPENSITY SCORE; PROSTATE-CANCER; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL STATUS; FAILURE; MODEL; BRACHYTHERAPY; ASSOCIATION; PREDICTORS; SELECTION	When drawing causal inferences about the effects of multiple treatments on clustered survival outcomes using observational data, we need to address implications of the multilevel data structure, multiple treatments, censoring, and unmeasured confounding for causal analyses. Few off-the-shelf causal inference tools are available to simultaneously tackle these issues. We develop a flexible random-intercept accelerated failure time model, in which we use Bayesian additive regression trees to capture arbitrarily complex relationships between censored survival times and pre-treatment covariates and use the random intercepts to capture cluster-specific main effects. We develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to draw posterior inferences about the population survival effects of multiple treatments and examine the variability in cluster-level effects. We further propose an interpretable sensitivity analysis approach to evaluate the sensitivity of drawn causal inferences about treatment effect to the potential magnitude of departure from the causal assumption of no unmeasured confounding. Expansive simulations empirically validate and demonstrate good practical operating characteristics of our proposed methods. Applying the proposed methods to a dataset on older high-risk localized prostate cancer patients drawn from the National Cancer Database, we evaluate the comparative effects of three treatment approaches on patient survival, and assess the ramifications of potential unmeasured confounding.

J	Sanbauer, C; Pan, W				Sanbauer, Charles; Pan, Wei			FLEXIBLE INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE MODELS WITH BAYESIAN ADDITIVE REGRESSION TREES	ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Causality; genetics; instrumental variables; machine learning; Mendelian randomiza- tion	ALL-CAUSE; INFERENCE; MORTALITY; HEALTH; BMI	Methods utilizing instrumental variables have been a fundamental statistical approach to causal estimation in the presence of unmeasured confounding, usually occurring in nonrandomized observational data common to fields such as economics and public health. However, such methods traditionally make constricting linearity and additivity assumptions that are inapplicable to the complex modeling challenges of today. The growing body of observational data being collected may benefit from flexible regression modeling while also retaining the ability to control for confounding using instrumental variables. Therefore, this article presents a flexible instrumental variable regression model based on Bayesian regression tree ensembles to estimate the causal exposure -outcome relationship, including interactions with covariates, in the presence of confounding. One exciting application of this method is to use genetic variants as instruments, known as Mendelian randomization. We present our flexible Bayesian instrumental variable regression tree method with an example from the UK Biobank where body mass index is related to blood pressure using genetic variants as the instruments. Body mass index is one factor that is hypothesized to have a nonlinear relationship with cardiovascular risk factors, such as blood pressure, while interacting with age. Heterogeneity in patient characteristics, such as age, could be clinically interesting from a precision medicine perspective where individualized treatment is emphasized.

J	Kawachi, I				Kawachi, Ichiro			Globalization and workers' health	INDUSTRIAL HEALTH			English	Article						globalization; non-standard work; propensity score matching	NONSTANDARD EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS	The global integration of economies worldwide has led to increased pressure for "labor flexibility". A notable aspect of this trend has been the rise in non-standard work arrangements, which include part-time work, temporary agency-based work, fixed-term contingent work, and independent contracting. Although non-standard work arrangements are convenient for employers, they are often associated with poor pay, absence of pension and health benefits, as well as lack of protection from unions and labor laws. Studies have begun to address the question of whether these "precarious" jobs pose a health hazard for workers. The challenge for causal inference is that precarious workers are likely to differ from non-precarious workers in a variety of characteristics that also influence health outcomes, i.e. there is confounding and selection bias. However, even after taking account of these biases -through propensity score-matched analysis- there is evidence to suggest that non-standard work may be damaging to workers' health. Policies modeled after the European Union's Directive on Part-Time Work may help to mitigate some of the health hazards associated with precarious work.

J	Yu, QZ; Zhang, L; Wu, XC; Li, B				Yu, Qingzhao; Zhang, Lu; Wu, Xiaocheng; Li, Bin			Inference on moderation effect with third-variable effect analysis - application to explore the trend of racial disparity in oncotype dx test for breast cancer treatment	JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Confounding; mediation effect; health inequality; moderation; interactive effect; racial disparity; third-variable analysis	CHEMOTHERAPY; MEDIATION; RECURRENCE; ASSAY	Third variable effect refers to the effect from a third variable that explains an observed relationship between an exposure and an outcome. Depending on whether there is causal relationship, typically, a third variable takes the format of a mediator or a confounder. A moderation effect is a special case of the third-variable effect, where the moderator and other variables have an interactive effect on the outcome. In this paper, we extend the R package 'mma' for moderation analysis so that third-variable effects can be reported at different levels of the moderator. The proposed moderation analysis use tree-structured models to automatically detect moderation effects and can handle both categorical and numerical moderators. We propose algorithms and graphical methods for making inference on moderation effects and illustrate the method under different scenarios of moderation effects. Finally, we apply the proposed method to explore the trend of racial disparities in the use of Oncotype DX recurrence tests among breast cancer patients. We found that the unexplained racial differences in using the tests have decreased from 2010 to 2015.

More and more, they seem to be used simultaneously in studies evaluating health interventions. The present review aimed to analyze the agreement between PS and IV results in medical research published to date. Study Design and Setting: Review of all published observational studies that evaluated a clinical intervention using simultaneously PS and IV analyses, as identified in MEDLINE and Web of Science. Results: Thirty-seven studies, most of them published during the previous 5 years, reported 55 comparisons between results from PS and IV analyses. There was a slight/fair agreement between the methods [Cohen's kappa coefficient = 0.21 (95% confidence interval: 0.00, 0.41)]. In 23 cases (42%), results were nonsignificant for one method and significant for the other, and IV analysis results were nonsignificant in most situations (87%). Conclusion: Discrepancies are frequent between PS and IV analyses and can be interpreted in various ways. This suggests that researchers should carefully consider their analytical choices, and readers should be cautious when interpreting results, until further studies clarify the respective roles of the two methods in observational comparative effectiveness research.

Experimental studies are the standard to identify ecological cause-effect relationships, but their results do not necessarily translate to field situations. Deriving ecological cause-effect relationships from observational field data is, however, challenging due to potential confounding influences of unmeasured variables. Here, we present a causal discovery algorithm designed to reveal ecological relationships in rivers and streams from observational data. Our algorithm (a) takes into account the spatial structure of the river network, (b) reveals the complete network of ecological relationships, and (c) shows the directions of these relationships. We apply our algorithm to data collected in the US state of Ohio to better understand causes of reductions in fish and invertebrate community integrity. We found that nitrogen is a key variable underlying fish and invertebrate community integrity in Ohio, likely negatively impacting both. We also found that fish and community integrity are each linked to one physical habitat quality variable. Our algorithm further revealed a split between physical habitat quality and water quality variables, indicating that causal relations between these groups of variables are likely absent. Our approach is able to reveal networks of ecological relationships in rivers and streams based on observational data, without the need to formulate a priori hypotheses. This is an asset particularly for diagnostic assessments of the ecological state and potential causes of biodiversity impairment in rivers and streams.

A Simple Model Allowing Modification of the Effect of a Randomized Intervention by Post-Randomization Variables	JOURNAL OF CAUSAL INFERENCE			English	Article						cognitive therapy; depression; interaction; stratification	CAUSAL INFERENCE; EARLY RESPONSE; THERAPY; TRIALS; NONCOMPLIANCE; PSYCHOTHERAPY; HOPELESSNESS; MODERATORS; MEDIATION	We address several questions relating to the use of standard regression and Structural Nested Mean Model (SNMM) approach (e. g., Ten Have et al. 2007) to analyze post-randomization effect modifiers of the intent-to-treat effect of a randomized intervention on a subsequent outcome, which has not been well examined. We show through simulations that the SNMM performs better with respect to bias of estimates of the intervention and interaction effects than does the corresponding standard interaction approach when the baseline intervention is randomized and the post-randomization factors are subject to confounding, and even when there is no association between the intervention and effect modifier. However, causal inference under the SNMM makes untestable assumptions that the causal contrasts do not vary across observed levels of the intervention and post-randomization factor. In addition, the precision of the SNMM-based estimators depends on the effect of the randomized intervention on the post-randomization factor varying across baseline covariate combinations. These issues and methods are illustrated with the application of the standard and causal methods to a randomized cognitive therapy (CT) trial, for which there is a conceptual model of negative cognitive styles or distortions impacted by CT but then in turn modifying the effect of CT on subsequent suicide ideation and social problem solving outcomes.

CLAIMS Res Team	Causal language and strength of inference in academic and media articles shared in social media (CLAIMS): A systematic review	PLOS ONE			English	Review							RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIALS; PRESS RELEASES; OBESITY; CANCER; HEALTH; IMPACT; NEWS	Background The pathway from evidence generation to consumption contains many steps which can lead to overstatement or misinformation. The proliferation of internet-based health news may encourage selection of media and academic research articles that overstate strength of causal inference. We investigated the state of causal inference in health research as it appears at the end of the pathway, at the point of social media consumption. Methods We screened the NewsWhip Insights database for the most shared media articles on Facebook and Twitter reporting about peer-reviewed academic studies associating an exposure with a health outcome in 2015, extracting the 50 most-shared academic articles and media articles covering them. We designed and utilized a review tool to systematically assess and summarize studies' strength of causal inference, including generalizability, potential confounders, and methods used. These were then compared with the strength of causal language used to describe results in both academic and media articles. Two randomly assigned independent reviewers and one arbitrating reviewer from a pool of 21 reviewers assessed each article. Results We accepted the most shared 64 media articles pertaining to 50 academic articles for review, representing 68% of Facebook and 45% of Twitter shares in 2015. Thirty-four percent of academic studies and 48% of media articles used language that reviewers considered too strong for their strength of causal inference. Seventy percent of academic studies were considered low or very low strength of inference, with only 6% considered high or very high strength of causal inference. The most severe issues with academic studies' causal inference were reported to be omitted confounding variables and generalizability. Fifty-eight percent of media articles were found to have inaccurately reported the question, results, intervention, or population of the academic study. Conclusions We find a large disparity between the strength of language as presented to the research consumer and the underlying strength of causal inference among the studies most widely shared on social media. However, because this sample was designed to be representative of the articles selected and shared on social media, it is unlikely to be representative of all academic and media work. More research is needed to determine how academic institutions, media organizations, and social network sharing patterns impact causal inference and language as received by the research consumer.

Instrumental variables estimation of exposure effects on a time-to-event endpoint using structural cumulative survival models	BIOMETRICS			English	Article						Causal effect; Confounding; Current treatment interaction; G-estimation; Instrumental variable; Mendelian randomization	NONCOMPLIANCE	The use of instrumental variables for estimating the effect of an exposure on an outcome is popular in econometrics, and increasingly so in epidemiology. This increasing popularity may be attributed to the natural occurrence of instrumental variables in observational studies that incorporate elements of randomization, either by design or by nature (e.g., random inheritance of genes). Instrumental variables estimation of exposure effects is well established for continuous outcomes and to some extent for binary outcomes. It is, however, largely lacking for time-to-event outcomes because of complications due to censoring and survivorship bias. In this article, we make a novel proposal under a class of structural cumulative survival models which parameterize time-varying effects of a point exposure directly on the scale of the survival function; these models are essentially equivalent with a semi-parametric variant of the instrumental variables additive hazards model. We propose a class of recursive instrumental variable estimators for these exposure effects, and derive their large sample properties along with inferential tools. We examine the performance of the proposed method in simulation studies and illustrate it in a Mendelian randomization study to evaluate the effect of diabetes on mortality using data from the Health and Retirement Study. We further use the proposed method to investigate potential benefit from breast cancer screening on subsequent breast cancer mortality based on the HIP-study.

Causal Effect of Chronic Pain on Mortality Through Opioid Prescriptions <i>Application of the Front-Door Formula</i>	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Bias analysis; Chronic pain; Front-door formula; G-computation; Mortality; NHANES; Opioids	WIDESPREAD BODY PAIN; UNITED-STATES; OVERDOSE DEATHS; PREVALENCE; RISK; ASSOCIATION; PHYSICIANS; ABUSE	Background: Chronic pain is the leading cause of disability worldwide and is strongly associated with the epidemic of opioid overdosing events. However, the causal links between chronic pain, opioid prescriptions, and mortality remain unclear. Methods: This study included 13,884 US adults aged 20 years who provided data on chronic pain in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2004 with linkage to mortality databases through 2015. We employed the generalized form of the front-door formula within the structural causal model framework to investigate the causal effect of chronic pain on all-cause mortality mediated by opioid prescriptions. Results: We identified a total of 718 participants at 3 years of followup and 1260 participants at 5 years as having died from all causes. Opioid prescriptions increased the risk of all-cause mortality with an estimated odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval) = 1.5 (1.1, 1.9) at 3 years and 1.3 (1.1, 1.6) at 5 years. The front-door formula revealed that chronic pain increased the risk of all-cause mortality through opioid prescriptions; OR = 1.06 (1.01, 1.11) at 3 years and 1.03 (1.01, 1.06) at 5 years. Our bias analysis showed that our findings based on the front-door formula were likely robust to plausible sources of bias from uncontrolled exposure-mediator or mediator-outcome confounding. Conclusions: Chronic pain increased the risk of all-cause mortality through opioid prescriptions. Our findings highlight the importance of careful guideline-based chronic pain management to prevent death from possibly inappropriate opioid prescriptions driven by chronic pain.

Two main obstacles are the presence of non-proportional hazards and confounding bias. Existing methods that could adjust for NPH or confounding bias, but no previous work delineated the complexity of simultaneous adjustments for both. In this paper, a propensity score stratified MaxCombo and weighted Cox model is proposed. This model can adjust for confounding bias and NPH and can be pre-specified when NPH pattern is unknown in advance. The method has robust performance as demonstrated in simulation studies and in a case study.

Marginal Structural Models for Case-Cohort Study Designs to Estimate the Association of Antiretroviral Therapy Initiation With Incident AIDS or Death	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						acquired immunodeficiency syndrome; case-cohort studies; cohort studies; confounding bias; HIV; pharmacoepidemiology; selection bias	CAUSAL INFERENCE; VIRAL LOAD; SURVIVAL; INTERVENTIONS; REGRESSION; MORTALITY; EXPOSURE; DISEASE; TIME; LIFE	To estimate the association of antiretroviral therapy initiation with incident acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) or death while accounting for time-varying confounding in a cost-efficient manner, the authors combined a case-cohort study design with inverse probability-weighted estimation of a marginal structural Cox proportional hazards model. A total of 950 adults who were positive for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 were followed in 2 US cohort studies between 1995 and 2007. In the full cohort, 211 AIDS cases or deaths occurred during 4,456 person-years. In an illustrative 20% random subcohort of 190 participants, 41 AIDS cases or deaths occurred during 861 person-years. Accounting for measured confounders and determinants of dropout by inverse probability weighting, the full cohort hazard ratio was 0.41 (95% confidence interval: 0.26, 0.65) and the case-cohort hazard ratio was 0.47 (95% confidence interval: 0.26, 0.83). Standard multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios were closer to the null, regardless of study design. The precision lost with the case-cohort design was modest given the cost savings. Results from Monte Carlo simulations demonstrated that the proposed approach yields approximately unbiased estimates of the hazard ratio with appropriate confidence interval coverage. Marginal structural model analysis of case-cohort study designs provides a cost-efficient design coupled with an accurate analytic method for research settings in which there is time-varying confounding.

Bayesian Approach for Network Modeling of Brain Structural Features	MEDICAL IMAGING 2010: BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS IN MOLECULAR, STRUCTURAL, AND FUNCTIONAL IMAGING	Proceedings of SPIE		English	Proceedings Paper	Conference on Medical Imaging 2010 - Biomedical Applications in Molecular, Structural, and Functional Imaging	FEB 14-16, 2010	San Diego, CA	SPIE, Medtronic, Inc, Aeroflex, Inc, Tungsten Heavy Powder, Inc		Bayesian Networks; structural equation modeling; structure learning; cortical features	SMALL-WORLD; CONNECTIVITY	Brain connectivity patterns are useful in understanding brain function and organization. Anatomical brain connectivity is largely determined using the physical synaptic connections between neurons. In contrast statistical brain connectivity in a given brain population refers to the interaction and interdependencies of statistics of multitudes of brain features including cortical area, volume, thickness etc. Traditionally, this dependence has been studied by statistical correlations of cortical features. In this paper, we propose the use of Bayesian network modeling for inferring statistical brain connectivity patterns that relate to causal (directed) as well as non-causal (undirected) relationships between cortical surface areas. We argue that for multivariate cortical data, the Bayesian model provides for a more accurate representation by removing the effect of confounding correlations that get introduced due to canonical dependence between the data. Results are presented for a population of 466 brains, where a SEM (structural equation modeling) approach is used to generate a Bayesian network model, as well as a dependency graph for the joint distribution of cortical areas.

Selection bias in prevalent cohorts is often corrected by excluding observation time and events during the first time period after inclusion in the cohort. This time period must be chosen carefully-long enough to minimize selection bias but not too long so as to unnecessarily discard observation time and events. A novel method visualizing and estimating selection bias is described and exemplified by using 2 real cohort study examples: a study of hepatitis C virus infection and a study of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. The method is based on modeling the hazard for the outcome of interest as a function of time since inclusion in the cohort. The events studied were "hospitalizations for kidney-related disease" in the hepatitis C virus cohort and "death" in the monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance cohort. Both cohorts show signs of considerable selection bias as evidenced by increased hazard in the time period after inclusion in the cohort. The method was very useful in visualizing selection bias and in determining the initial time period to be excluded from the analyses.

A potential outcomes approach to defining and estimating gestational age-specific exposure effects during pregnancy	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Causal inference; counterfactuals; perinatal epidemiology; pregnancy exposures; targeted maximum likelihood estimation; target trials; inverse probability weighting; G-computation	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; INVERSE PROBABILITY; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; BIRTH; BIAS; SURVIVAL; ASTHMA; THERAPY; ACCOUNT	Many studies seek to evaluate the effects of potentially harmful pregnancy exposures during specific gestational periods. We consider an observational pregnancy cohort where pregnant individuals can initiate medication usage or become exposed to a drug at various times during their pregnancy. An important statistical challenge involves how to define and estimate exposure effects when pregnancy loss or delivery can occur over time. Without proper consideration, the results of standard analysis may be vulnerable to selection bias, immortal time-bias, and time-dependent confounding. In this study, we apply the "target trials" framework of Hernan and Robins in order to define effects based on the counterfactual approach often used in causal inference. This effect is defined relative to a hypothetical randomized trial of timed pregnancy exposures where delivery may precede and thus potentially interrupt exposure initiation. We describe specific implementations of inverse probability weighting, G-computation, and Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation to estimate the effects of interest. We demonstrate the performance of all estimators using simulated data and show that a standard implementation of inverse probability weighting is biased. We then apply our proposed methods to a pharmacoepidemiology study to evaluate the potentially time-dependent effect of exposure to inhaled corticosteroids on birthweight in pregnant people with mild asthma.

A simple alternative, canonical link generalized linear models (GLM) fit via inverse probability of treatment (propensity score) weighted maximum likelihood estimation followed by standardization (the g$$ g $$-formula) for the average causal effect, is a doubly robust estimation method. Our aim is for the reader not just to be able to use this method, which we refer to as IPTW GLM, for doubly robust estimation, but to fully understand why it has the doubly robust property. For this reason, we define clearly, and in multiple ways, all concepts needed to understand the method and why it is doubly robust. In addition, we want to make very clear that the mere combination of propensity score weighting and an adjusted outcome model does not generally result in a doubly robust estimator. Finally, we hope to dispel the misconception that one can adjust for residual confounding remaining after propensity score weighting by adjusting in the outcome model for what remains 'unbalanced' even when using doubly robust estimators.

However, the heterogeneity and sheer diversity of the population and healthcare systems makes it impossible for researchers to compare "like with like" when attempting to draw causal inferences about interventions and outcomes. The critical issue in epidemiological datasets relates to high risk of bias due to confounders that stem from baseline differences between groups. Propensity score (PS) techniques are statistical approaches that have been used to tackle potential imbalance in the comparison groups. The PS is the estimated probability (based on measured baseline covariates) that the patient receives a particular intervention. Patients that share similar PS will most likely have the same distributions of underlying covariates included in the PS. Implementation of PS methods may achieve better balance of covariates, but there is no consensus on the best way of capturing all relevant confounders for incorporation into the PS model. Should covariates be selected by clinical or epidemiological experts, or would data-driven algorithms (machine learning) offer more efficient and reliable methods of estimating PS and controlling for confounding? The PS can be incorporated into the analysis in different ways, each with its own strengths and limitations, and researchers must choose the best fit for their study objectives. PS methods are particularly advantageous in situations where there are large numbers of measured covariates but relatively few outcome events captured in healthcare administrative databases.

The Relationship between Education and Mental Health: New Evidence from a Discordant Twin Study	SOCIAL FORCES			English	Article							SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; SOCIAL CAUSATION; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS; UNITED-STATES; DEPRESSION; SELECTION; INEQUALITIES; ASSOCIATION; FAMILY; ATTAINMENT	Prior research has documented a strong and positive correlation between completed education and adults' mental health. Researchers often describe this relationship using causal language: higher levels of education are thought to enhance people's skills, afford important structural advantages, and empower better coping mechanisms, all of which lead to better mental health. An alternative explanation-the social selection hypothesis-suggests that schooling is a proxy for unobserved endowments and/or preexisting conditions that confound the relationship between the two variables. In this article, we seek to adjudicate between these hypotheses using a relatively large, US-based sample of identical adult twins. By relating within-twin-pair differences in education to within-twin-pair differences in mental health, we are able to control for the influence of genetic traits and shared family characteristics that may otherwise bias the estimates associated with educational attainment. Results from our analyses suggest that the observed association between education and mental health is attributable to confounding on unobserved variables. This finding holds across mental health conditions, is robust to several sensitivity checks, and survives a falsification test. Theoretical implications for the study of educational gradients in mental health are discussed.

On falsification of the binary instrumental variable model	BIOMETRIKA			English	Article						Binary response; Gail-Simon test; Instrumental variable; Qualitative interaction; t-test; Two-by-two table	CAUSAL INFERENCE; TESTS; BOUNDS	Instrumental variables are widely used for estimating causal effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding. The discrete instrumental variable model has testable implications for the law of the observed data. However, current assessments of instrumental validity are typically based solely on subject-matter arguments rather than these testable implications, partly due to a lack of formal statistical tests with known properties. In this paper, we develop simple procedures for testing the binary instrumental variable model. Our methods are based on existing techniques for comparing two treatments, such as the t-test and the Gail-Simon test. We illustrate the importance of testing the instrumental variable model by evaluating the exogeneity of college proximity using the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men.

Patients within provider-based clusters likely exert and share influence on each other's treatment preferences and subsequent health outcomes and this is known as dissemination or spillover. Extending a framework to replicate an idealized two-stage randomized trial using routinely-collected health data, an evaluation of disseminated effects within provider-based clusters is possible. In this article, we propose a novel application of causal inference methods for dissemination to retrospective cohort studies in administrative claims data and evaluate the impact of the normality of the random effects distribution for the cluster-level propensity score on estimation of the causal parameters. An extensive simulation study was conducted to study the robustness of the methods under different distributions of the random effects. We applied these methods to evaluate baseline prescription for medications for opioid use disorder among a cohort of patients diagnosed with opioid use disorder and adjust for baseline confounders using information obtained from an administrative claims database. We discuss future research directions in this setting to better address unmeasured confounding in the presence of disseminated effects.

This article reviews the major developments. It starts with Cornfield's demonstration of odds ratio invariance under cohort versus case-control sampling, proceeds through the still-popular Mantel-Haenszel procedure and its extensions for dependent data, and highlights (conditional) likelihood methods for relative risk regression. Recent work on nested case-control, case-cohort, and two-stage case-control designs demonstrates the continuing impact of statistical thinking on epidemiology. The influence of R. A. Fisher's work on these developments is mentioned wherever possible. His objections to the drawing of causal conclusions from observational data on cigarette smoking and lung cancer are used to introduce the problems of measurement error and confounding bias. The resolution of such difficulties, whether by further development and implementation of randomized intervention trials or by causal analysis of observational data using graphical models containing latent variables, will challenge future generations of statisticians.

Even in trials of a predominantly pragmatic nature, there may be numerous reasons to consider the extent, and impact on analysis, of such deviations from protocol. Simple methods such as per-protocol or as-treated analyses, which exclude or censor patients on the basis of their adherence, usually introduce selection and confounding biases. However, there exist appropriate causal estimation methods which seek to overcome these inherent biases, but these methods remain relatively unfamiliar and are rarely implemented in trials. Methods: This paper demonstrates when it may be of interest to look beyond intention-to-treat analysis for answers to alternative causal research questions through illustrative case studies. We seek to guide trialists on how to handle treatment changes in the design, conduct and planning the analysis of a trial; these changes may be planned or unplanned, and may or may not be permitted in the protocol. We highlight issues that must be considered at the trial planning stage relating to: the definition of nonadherence and the causal research question of interest, trial design, data collection, monitoring, statistical analysis and sample size. Results and conclusions: During trial planning, trialists should define their causal research questions of interest, anticipate the likely extent of treatment changes and use these to inform trial design, including the extent of data collection and data monitoring. A series of concise recommendations is presented to guide trialists when considering undertaking causal analyses.

Yet, observed associations with early exposures may not reflect causal effects because of genetic and environmental confounding. The current manuscript describes how a systematic series of epidemiologic analyses that combine several genetically-informative designs and statistical approaches can help distinguish between competing theories. In particular, the manuscript details how combining the use of measured covariates with sibling-comparisons, cousin-comparisons, and additional designs can help elucidate the sources of covariation between early-life exposures and later outcomes, including the roles of (a) factors that are not shared in families, including a potential causal effect of the exposure; (b) carryover effects from the exposure of one child to the next; and (c) familial confounding. We also describe key assumptions and how they can be critically evaluated. Furthermore, we outline how subsequent analyses, including effect decomposition with respect to measured, plausible mediators, and quantitative genetic models can help further specify the underlying processes that account for the associations between early-life exposures and offspring outcomes.

We assessed the association, accounting for selective dropout due to death or dementia, and, in a subsample, accounting for confounding by early-life intelligence. Data from the Danish component of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (n = 3,400) were linked to registry data (education records, dementia diagnoses, and mortality) and the Danish Conscription Database (youth intelligence measurements for 854 men). Word recall and verbal fluency were assessed up to 4 times over 10 years (2004-2013) and combined by averaging the z scores. We fitted a joint model linking a time-to-event model for dementia or death to a linear mixed-effects model for cognitive change. Rate of cognitive decline was slower among people with high education compared with low education (beta = 0.112, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.056,0.170). Adjusting for youth intelligence did not attenuate the association between education and cognitive decline (crude beta = 0.136,95% CI: 0.028,0.244 vs. adjusted beta = 0.145,95% CI: 0.022,0.269).

MethodsWe conducted a series of Monte Carlo simulations on virtual observational studies. After estimating the propensity scores by logistic regression, we performed 1:1 optimal, nearest-neighbor, and caliper matching. We used 4 estimators on each matched sample: (1) a crude estimator without double-adjustment, (2) double-adjustment for the propensity scores, (3) double-adjustment for the unweighted unbalanced covariates, and (4) double-adjustment for the unbalanced covariates, weighted by their strength of association with the outcome. ResultsThe crude estimator led to highest bias in all tested scenarios. Double-adjustment for the propensity scores effectively removed confounding only when the propensity score models were correctly specified. Double-adjustment for the unbalanced covariates was more robust to misspecification. Double-adjustment for the weighted unbalanced covariates outperformed the other approaches in every scenario and using any matching algorithm, as measured by the mean squared error. ConclusionDouble-adjustment can be used to remove residual confounding after propensity score matching. The unbalanced covariates with the strongest confounding effects should be adjusted.

RWE studies follow a structured approach. (1) A design layer decides on the study design, which is driven by the study question and refined by a medically informed target population, patient-informed outcomes, and biologically informed effect windows. Imagining the randomized trial we would ideally perform before designing an RWE study in its likeness reduces bias; the new-user active comparator cohort design has proven useful in many RWE studies of diabetes treatments. (2) A measurement layer transforms the longitudinal patient-level data stream into variables that identify the study population, the pre-exposure patient characteristics, the treatment, and the treatment-emergent outcomes. Working with secondary data increases the measurement complexity compared to primary data collection that we find in most RCTs. (3) An analysis layer focuses on the causal treatment effect estimation. Propensity score analyses have gained in popularity to minimize confounding in healthcare database analyses. Well-understood investigator errors, like immortal time bias, adjustment for causal intermediates, or reverse causation, should be avoided. To increase reproducibility of RWE findings, studies require full implementation transparency. This article integrates state-of-the-art knowledge on how to conduct and review RWE studies on diabetes treatments to maximize study validity and ultimately increased confidence in RWE-based decision making.

Recently, the principle has been applied to other forms of bias in observational studies, especially collider bias that arises when conditioning or stratifying on a variable that is associated with the outcome of interest. An important case is in studies of disease progression and survival. Here, we clarify the links between the genetic instrumental variable methods proposed for this problem and the established methods of Mendelian randomisation developed to account for confounding. We highlight the critical importance of weak instrument bias in this context and describe a corrected weighted least-squares procedure as a simple approach to reduce this bias. We illustrate the range of available methods on two data examples. The first, waist-hip ratio adjusted for body-mass index, entails statistical adjustment for a quantitative trait. The second, smoking cessation, is a stratified analysis conditional on having initiated smoking. In both cases, we find little effect of collider bias on the primary association results, but this may propagate into more substantial effects on further analyses such as polygenic risk scoring and Mendelian randomisation.

Despite the theoretical advancement of confounding selection procedure, it is often challenging to distinguish between confounders and mediators due to the lack of information about the time-ordering and latency of each variable in the data. This is also the case for the studies of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a group of synthetic chemicals used in industry and consumer products that are persistent and have endocrine-disrupting properties on health outcomes. In this article, we used directed acyclic graphs to describe potential biases introduced by adjusting for or stratifying by the measure of obesity as an intermediate variable in PFAS exposure analyses. We compared results with or without adjusting for body mass index in two cross-sectional data analyses: (1) PFAS levels and maternal thyroid function during early pregnancy using the Danish National Birth Cohort and (2) PFAS levels and cardiovascular disease in adults using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In these examples, we showed that the potential heterogeneity observed in stratified analyses by overweight or obese status needs to be interpreted cautiously considering collider stratification bias. This article highlights the complexity of seemingly simple adjustment or stratification analyses, and the need for careful consideration of the confounding and/or mediating role of obesity in PFAS studies.

Objective: To determine the extent to which the association between SDP and offspring substance use/problems depends on confounded familial background factors by using a quasi-experimental design. Design: We used 2 separate samples from the United States and Sweden. The analyses prospectively predicted multiple indices of substance use and problems while controlling for statistical covariates and comparing differentially exposed siblings to minimize confounding. Setting: Offspring of a representative sample of women in the United States (sample 1) and the total Swedish population born during the period from January 1, 1983, to December 31, 1995 (sample 2). Patients or Other Participants: Adolescent offspring of the women in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (n=6904) and all offspring born in Sweden during the 13-year period (n=1187360). Main Outcome Measures: Self-reported adolescent alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use and early onset (before 14 years of age) of each substance (sample 1) and substance-related convictions and hospitalizations for an alcohol-or other drug-related problem (sample 2). Results: The same pattern emerged for each index of substance use/problems across the 2 samples. At the population level, maternal SDP predicted every measure of offspring substance use/problems in both samples, ranging from adolescent alcohol use (hazard ratio [HR](moderate), 1.32 [95% CI, 1.22-1.43]; HRhigh, 1.33 [1.17-1.53]) to a narcotics-related conviction (HRmoderate, 2.23 [2.14-2.31]; HRhigh, 2.97 [2.86-3.09]). When comparing differentially exposed siblings to minimize genetic and environmental confounds, however, the association between SDP and each measure of substance use/problems was minimal and not statistically significant. Conclusions: The association between maternal SDP and offspring substance use/problems is likely due to familial background factors, not a causal influence, because siblings have similar rates of substance use and problems regardless of their specific exposure to SDP.

Performance of Disease Risk Scores, Propensity Scores, and Traditional Multivariable Outcome Regression in the Presence of Multiple Confounders	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						confounding factors (epidemiology); epidemiologic methods; observational study; pharmacoepidemiology	NONSTEROIDAL ANTIINFLAMMATORY DRUGS; CORONARY HEART-DISEASE; SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; VARIABLE SELECTION; STRATIFICATION; ADJUSTMENT; EVENTS; MODELS; NUMBER	Propensity scores are widely used in cohort studies to improve performance of regression models when considering large numbers of covariates. Another type of summary score, the disease risk score (DRS), which estimates disease probability conditional on nonexposure, has also been suggested. However, little is known about how it compares with propensity scores. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted comparing regression models using the DRS and the propensity score with models that directly adjust for all of the individual covariates. The DRS was calculated in 2 ways: from the unexposed population and from the full cohort. Compared with traditional multivariable outcome regression models, all 3 summary scores had comparable performance for moderate correlation between exposure and covariates and, for strong correlation, the full-cohort DRS and propensity score had comparable performance. When traditional methods had model misspecification, propensity scores and the full-cohort DRS had superior performance. All 4 models were affected by the number of events per covariate, with propensity scores and traditional multivariable outcome regression least affected. These data suggest that, for cohort studies for which covariates are not highly correlated with exposure, the DRS, particularly that calculated from the full cohort, is a useful tool.

Estimating controlled direct effects of restrictive feeding practices in the 'Early dieting in girls' study	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Causal inference; Controlled direct effects; Generalized boosted model; Mediator; Model combining; Random forests	PROPENSITY SCORE ESTIMATION; MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; MEDIATION; IDENTIFICATION; STRATEGIES; REGRESSION	We examine the causal effect of parental restrictive feeding practices on children's weight status. An important mediator is children's self-regulation status. Recent approaches interpret mediation effects on the basis of the potential outcomes framework. Inverse probability weighting based on propensity scores are used to adjust for confounding and to reduce the dimensionality of confounders simultaneously. We show that combining machine learning algorithms and logistic regression to estimate the propensity scores can be more accurate and efficient in estimating the controlled direct effects than using logistic regression alone. A data application shows that the causal effect of mother's restrictive feeding differs according to whether the daughter eats in the absence of hunger.

Further, previous studies have not accounted for possible time-dependent confounding of the association between MBD markers and death due to the effect of markers of MBD on treatments, which subsequently may affect MBD markers. Study Design: Multicenter, 3-year, prospective, case-cohort study. Setting & Participants: 8,229 hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (parathyroid hormone level <= 180 pg/mL and/or receiving vitamin D receptor activators) at 86 facilities in Japan. Predictors: Serum phosphorus, calcium, and parathyroid hormone levels. Outcome: All-cause mortality. Measurements: Marginal structural models were used to compute absolute differences in all-cause mortality associated with different levels of predictors while accounting for time-dependent confounding. Results: The association between phosphorus level and mortality appeared U-shaped, although only higher phosphorus level categories reached statistical significance: compared to those with phosphorus levels of 5.0-5.9 mg/dL (1.61-1.93 mmol/L), patients with the highest (>= 9.0 mg/dL [>= 2.90 mmol/L]) phosphorus levels had 9.4 excess deaths/100 person-years (rate ratio, 2.79 [95% CI, 1.26-6.15]), whereas no association was found for the lowest phosphorus category (< 3.0 mg/dL [< 0.97 mmol/L]; rate ratio, 1.54 [95% CI, 0.87-2.71]). Similarly, hypercalcemia (>= 10.0 mg/dL [>= 2.50 mmol/L]) was associated with excess deaths, and the highest level of hypercalcemia (>= 11.0 mg/dL [>= 2.75 mmol/L]) was associated with 5.8 excess deaths/100 person-years ( rate ratio, 2.38 [ 95% CI, 1.77-3.21]) compared to those with levels of 9.0-9.4 mg/dL (2.25-2.37 mmol/L). Abnormally high parathyroid hormone levels were not associated with excess deaths. Limitations: Possible residual confounding. Conclusions: These results reinforce the idea that serum calcium (in addition to phosphorus) level is an important predictor of the absolute risk of death in hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Randomization of small numbers of larger units (e.g., health centres) is less effective for controlling confounding than randomization of individuals. Because early interventions are by definition targeted at healthy children or those with mild disease, outcomes cannot usually be assessed as within-subject changes, but are analysed as between-subject comparisons of traits, states or events. Methods derived from observational epidemiology, including multiple regression, logistic regression and proportional hazards regression, are appropriate here. When there are repeated measures of outcome (such as lung function monitored at intervals through childhood), random effects models or mixed longitudinal models may be used. Calculations of sample size need to take into account the proposed form of randomization and analysis, and also the efficacy of the intervention and degree of compliance, Multiple end-points should be ranked for importance at the start of a trial and greater weight attached to significant results for primary outcomes.

SEARCH Study	A new approach to hierarchical data analysis: Targeted maximum likelihood estimation for the causal effect of a cluster-level exposure	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Cluster-level exposures; cluster randomized trials; contagion; double robust; hierarchical; interference; multilevel; semi-parametric; Super Learner; targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE)	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; COVARIATE ADJUSTMENT; RANDOMIZED-TRIALS; PROPENSITY SCORE; INFERENCE; INFECTION; OUTCOMES; PACKAGE; GEE	We often seek to estimate the impact of an exposure naturally occurring or randomly assigned at the cluster-level. For example, the literature on neighborhood determinants of health continues to grow. Likewise, community randomized trials are applied to learn about real-world implementation, sustainability, and population effects of interventions with proven individual-level efficacy. In these settings, individual-level outcomes are correlated due to shared cluster-level factors, including the exposure, as well as social or biological interactions between individuals. To flexibly and efficiently estimate the effect of a cluster-level exposure, we present two targeted maximum likelihood estimators (TMLEs). The first TMLE is developed under a non-parametric causal model, which allows for arbitrary interactions between individuals within a cluster. These interactions include direct transmission of the outcome (i.e. contagion) and influence of one individual's covariates on another's outcome (i.e. covariate interference). The second TMLE is developed under a causal sub-model assuming the cluster-level and individual-specific covariates are sufficient to control for confounding. Simulations compare the alternative estimators and illustrate the potential gains from pairing individual-level risk factors and outcomes during estimation, while avoiding unwarranted assumptions. Our results suggest that estimation under the sub-model can result in bias and misleading inference in an observational setting. Incorporating working assumptions during estimation is more robust than assuming they hold in the underlying causal model. We illustrate our approach with an application to HIV prevention and treatment.

We also reviewed adjustment methods on major confounding factors such as gender and approaches to model morphomic data, especially mixed models for repeated measures. Finally, we focused on methods for determining a cut-off for a morphomic marker that could be used in clinical practice and how to assess its robustness.Expert commentary: From our review, we proposed 13 key points to strengthen analyses and reporting of clinical research assessing associations between morphomics and outcome or toxicity.

EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							INVERSE PROBABILITY WEIGHTS; CONFOUNDING ADJUSTMENT; VARIABLE SELECTION; SUPER LEARNER; MODEL; ASSOCIATION; PREDICTION; MORTALITY; BIAS	The use of retrospective health care claims datasets is frequently criticized for the lack of complete information on potential confounders. Utilizing patient's health status-related information from claims datasets as surrogates or proxies for mismeasured and unobserved confounders, the high-dimensional propensity score algorithm enables us to reduce bias. Using a previously published cohort study of postmyocardial infarction statin use (1998-2012), we compare the performance of the algorithm with a number of popular machine learning approaches for confounder selection in high-dimensional covariate spaces: random forest, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and elastic net. Our results suggest that, when the data analysis is done with epidemiologic principles in mind, machine learning methods perform as well as the high-dimensional propensity score algorithm. Using a plasmode framework that mimicked the empirical data, we also showed that a hybrid of machine learning and high-dimensional propensity score algorithms generally perform slightly better than both in terms of mean squared error, when a bias-based analysis is used.

Additionally, all subjects in both arms received intensive condom counselling and provision, the 'gold standard' HIV prevention barrier method. There was much lower reported use of condoms in the intervention arm than in the control arm, making it difficult to answer important public health questions based solely on the intention-to-treat analysis. We adapt an analysis technique from causal inference to estimate the 'direct effects' of assignment to the diaphragm arm, adjusting for use of condoms in an appropriate sense. Issues raised in the trial apply to other trials of HIV prevention methods, some of which are currently being conducted or designed.

Of 1,763 eligible participants from two US cohort studies followed between 1996 and 2002, 60 percent initiated HAART. The IPTC-weighted estimate of the difference in mean CD4 cell count at 1 year among participants continuously treated versus those never treated was 71 cells/mm(3) (95% confidence interval: 47.5, 94.6), which agrees with the reported results of randomized experiments. The corresponding estimate from a standard generalized estimating equations regression model that included baseline and most recent CD4 cell count and HIV type 1 RNA viral load as regressors was 26 cells/mm(3) (95% confidence interval: 17.7, 34.3). These results indicate that nonrandomized studies of HIV treatment need to be analyzed with methods (e.g., IPTC-weighted estimation) that, in contrast to standard methods, appropriately adjust for time-varying covariates that are simultaneously confounders and intermediate variables. The 1-year estimate of 71 cells/mm(3) was followed by an estimated continued increase of 29 cells/mm(3) per year (estimated effect at 6 years: 216 cells/mm(3)), providing evidence that the large short-term effect found in randomized experiments persists and continues to improve over 6 years.

To address this limitation, we propose an extension of CMA combining it with Mendelian randomization (MRinCMA). We applied the new approach to analyse the causal effect of obesity and diabetes on pancreatic cancer, considering each factor as potential mediator. To check the performance of MRinCMA under several conditions/scenarios, we used it in different simulated data sets and compared it with structural equation models. For continuous variables, MRinCMA and structural equation models performed similarly, suggesting that both approaches are valid to obtain unbiased estimates. When noncontinuous variables were considered, MRinCMA presented, overall, lower bias than structural equation models. By applying MRinCMA, we did not find any evidence of causality of obesity or diabetes on pancreatic cancer. With this new methodology, researchers would be able to address CMA hypotheses by appropriately accounting for the confounding bias assumption regardless of the conditions used in their studies in different settings.

Nine criteria of causality serving as the basis for the discussion have been developed. The criteria resemble criteria that have been widely used in epidemiology. To assess whether the coefficients estimated in a multivariate accident prediction model represent causal relationships or are non-causal statistical associations, all criteria of causality are relevant, but the most important criterion is how well a model controls for potentially confounding factors. Examples are given to show how the criteria of causality can be applied to multivariate accident prediction models in order to assess the relationships included in these models. It will often be the case that some of the relationships included in a model can reasonably be treated as causal, whereas for others such an interpretation is less supported. The criteria of causality are indicative only and cannot provide a basis for stringent logical proof of causality. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Propensity score methods for observational studies with clustered data: A review	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Review						causal inference; clustered data; multilevel; observational studies; propensity score	DOUBLY ROBUST ESTIMATION; CAUSAL INFERENCE; SELECTION BIAS; ASSESSING SENSITIVITY; MATCHING METHODS; STRATIFICATION; ADJUSTMENT; EXOGENEITY; DESIGNS; MODELS	Propensity score methods are a popular approach to mitigating confounding bias when estimating causal effects in observational studies. When study units are clustered (eg, patients nested within health systems), additional challenges arise such as accounting for unmeasured confounding at multiple levels and dependence between units within the same cluster. While clustered observational data are widely used to draw causal inferences in many fields, including medicine and healthcare, extensions of propensity score methods to clustered settings are still a relatively new area of research. This article presents a framework for estimating causal effects using propensity scores when study units are nested within clusters and are nonrandomly assigned to treatment conditions. We emphasize the need for investigators to examine the nature of the clustering, among other properties, of the observational data at hand in order to guide their choice of causal estimands and the corresponding propensity score approach.

However, interpretation of this dose-response relationship may have been confounded by participant characteristics such as baseline levels of substance use and mental health problems. Methods: The present study used statistical methods designed to approximate RCTs when comparing more than two nonequivalent groups that include an assessment of the potential impact of omitted variables. Classification and Regression Tree (CRT) analysis was used to establish the cut-point between high (H) and low (L) VRSA dosage groups. Because we were interested in generalizing to youth with poor attendance, the L-VRSA group served as the reference group. Balancing weights for H-VRSA and a services as usual (SAU) control group were calculated to ensure similarity of baseline pretreatment characteristics to the reference group, and sensitivity of findings to unobserved confounding variables was assessed. Results: Findings suggested that superior remission rates at the end of the intervention phase were the result of high adherence to planned VRSA session frequency. Recommendations to achieve high VRSA participation among a larger segment of youth and to test whether longer VRSA duration improves the stability of recovery outcomes are provided. Conclusion: Few published dose-response studies have adequately controlled for selection confounds from both observed and unobserved confounding. As such, the present study aims to both assess the impact of different dosage levels of VRSA and provide a template for how to apply state-of-the-art statistical methods designed to approximate randomized controlled trials to such studies.

Reflection on modern methods: understanding bias and data analytical strategies through DAG-based data simulations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Directed acyclic graphs; confounding bias; selection bias; teaching; simulation		Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are increasingly used in epidemiology to identify and address different types of bias. The present work aims to demonstrate how DAG-based data simulation can be used to understand bias and compare data analytical strategies in an educational context. Examples based on classical confounding situations and an M-DAG are examined and used to introduce basic concepts and demonstrate some important features of regression analysis, as well as the harmful effect of adjusting for a collider variable. Other potential uses of DAG-based data simulation include systematic comparisons of data analytical strategies or the evaluation of the role of uncertainties in a hypothesized DAG structure, including other types of bias such as information bias. DAG-based data simulations, like those presented here, should facilitate the exploration of several key epidemiological concepts, DAG theory and data analysis. Some suggestions are also made on how to further expand the ideas from this study.

Semiparametric estimation of structural failure time models in continuous-time processes	BIOMETRIKA			English	Article						Causality; Cox proportional hazards model; Discretization; Observational study; Semiparametric analysis; Survival data	CAUSAL INFERENCE; PROPHYLAXIS THERAPY; RANDOMIZED TRIALS; SURVIVAL; NONCOMPLIANCE; ROBUSTNESS	Structural failure time models are causal models for estimating the effect of time-varying treatments on a survival outcome. G-estimation and artificial censoring have been proposed for estimating the model parameters in the presence of time-dependent confounding and administrative censoring. However, most existing methods require manually pre-processing data into regularly spaced data, which may invalidate the subsequent causal analysis. Moreover, the computation and inference are challenging due to the nonsmoothness of artificial censoring. We propose a class of continuous-time structural failure time models that respects the continuous-time nature of the underlying data processes. Under a martingale condition of no unmeasured confounding, we show that the model parameters are identifiable from a potentially infinite number of estimating equations. Using the semiparametric efficiency theory, we derive the first semiparametric doubly robust estimators, which are consistent if the model for the treatment process or the failure time model, but not necessarily both, is correctly specified. Moreover, we propose using inverse probability of censoring weighting to deal with dependent censoring. In contrast to artificial censoring, our weighting strategy does not introduce nonsmoothness in estimation and ensures that resampling methods can be used for inference.

AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Editorial Material						breast feeding; causality; confounding	ASSOCIATION; MODELS; BIAS	Longitudinal studies are often viewed as the "gold standard'' of observational epidemiologic research. Establishing a temporal association is a necessary criterion to identify causal relations. However, when covariates in the causal system vary over time, a temporal association is not straightforward. Appropriate analytical methods may be necessary to avoid confounding and reverse causality. These issues come to light in 2 studies of breastfeeding described in the articles by Al-Sahab et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2011; 173(9): 971-977) and Kramer et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2011; 173(9): 978-983) in this issue of the Journal. Breastfeeding has multiple time points and is a behavior that is affected by multiple factors, many of which themselves vary over time. This creates a complex causal system that requires careful scrutiny. The methods presented here may be applicable to a wide range of studies that involve time-varying exposures and time-varying confounders.

The authors simulated a cohort study and performed 252,480 trials. In the logistic regression, the bias decreased as the number of events per confounder increased. In the propensity score, the bias decreased as the strength of the association of the exposure with the outcome increased. Propensity scores produced estimates that were less biased, more robust, and more precise than the logistic regression estimates. when there were seven or fewer events per confounder. The logistic regression empirical coverage probability increased as the number of events per confounder increased. The propensity score empirical coverage probability decreased after eight or more events per confounder. Overall, the propensity score exhibited more empirical power than logistic regression. Propensity scores are a good alternative to control for imbalances when there are seven or fewer events per confounder; however, empirical power could range from 35% to 60%. Logistic regression is the technique of choice when there are at least eight events per confounder.

The aim of this study was to compare the benefits of PCT and PCRT in GC patients and determine the factors affecting survival rate using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The data of 1,442 patients with stage II-IV GC who received PCT or PCRT from 2000 to 2018 were retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. First, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to identify possible influencing factors for overall survival. Second, the variables that were selected by LASSO were then used in univariate and Cox regression analyses. Third, corrective analyses for confounding factors were selected based on DAGs that show the possible association between advanced GC patients and outcomes and evaluate the prognosis. Patients who received PCRT had longer overall survival than those who received PCT treatment (P = 0.015). The median length of overall survival of the PCRT group was 36.5 (15.0 - 53.0) months longer than that of the PCT group (34.6 (16.0 - 48.0) months). PCRT is more likely to benefit patients who are aged & LE; 65, male, white, and have regional tumors (P<0.05). The multivariate Cox regression model showed that male sex, widowed status, signet ring cell carcinoma, and lung metastases were independent risk factors for a poor prognosis. According to DAG, age, race, and Lauren type may be confounding factors that affect the prognosis of advanced GC. Compared to PCT, PCRT has more survival benefits for patients with locally advanced GC, and ongoing investigations are needed to better determine the optimal treatment. Furthermore, DAGs are a useful tool for contending with confounding and selection biases to ensure the proper implementation of high-quality research.

This is because aspirin affects the synthesis of prostaglandin, a vasoactive mediator centrally involved in neurovascular coupling, a process underlying blood oxygenated level dependent (BOLD) responses. Aspirin-induced changes in BOLD signal are a potential confound for fMRI studies of at-risk individuals or patients (e.g. with cardiovascular conditions or stroke) who receive low-dose aspirin prophylactically and are compared to healthy controls without aspirin. To examine the severity of this potential confound, we combined high field (7 Tesla) MRI during a simple hand movement task with a biophysically informed hemodynamic model. We compared elderly individuals receiving aspirin for primary or secondary prophylactic purposes versus age-matched volunteers without aspirin medication, testing for putative differences in BOLD responses. Specifically, we fitted hemodynamic models to BOLD responses from 14 regions activated by the task and examined whether model parameter estimates were significantly altered by aspirin. While our analyses indicate that hemodynamics differed across regions, consistent with the known regional variability of BOLD responses, we neither found a significant main effect of aspirin (i.e., an average effect across brain regions) nor an expected drug x region interaction. While our sample size is not sufficiently large to rule out small-to-medium global effects of aspirin, we had adequate statistical power for detecting the expected interaction. Altogether, our analysis suggests that patients with cardiovascular risk receiving low-dose aspirin for primary or secondary prophylactic purposes do not show strongly altered BOLD signals when compared to healthy controls without aspirin.

J	Linden, A				Linden, Ariel			Improving causal inference with a doubly robust estimator that combines propensity score stratification and weighting	JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE			English	Article						causal inference; doubly robust; inverse probability of treatment weights; marginal mean weighting through stratification; propensity score; stratification; treatment effects	MANAGEMENT PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS; MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; MISSING DATA; ADJUSTMENT; BIAS; PERFORMANCE; CARE	Rationale, aims and objectives When a randomized controlled trial is not feasible, health researchers typically use observational data and rely on statistical methods to adjust for confounding when estimating treatment effects. These methods generally fall into 3 categories: (1) estimators based on a model for the outcome using conventional regression adjustment; (2) weighted estimators based on the propensity score (ie, a model for the treatment assignment); and (3) "doubly robust" (DR) estimators that model both the outcome and propensity score within the same framework. In this paper, we introduce a new DR estimator that utilizes marginal mean weighting through stratification (MMWS) as the basis for weighted adjustment. This estimator may prove more accurate than treatment effect estimators because MMWS has been shown to be more accurate than other models when the propensity score is misspecified. We therefore compare the performance of this new estimator to other commonly used treatment effects estimators. Method Monte Carlo simulation is used to compare the DR-MMWS estimator to regression adjustment, 2 weighted estimators based on the propensity score and 2 other DR methods. To assess performance under varied conditions, we vary the level of misspecification of the propensity score model as well as misspecify the outcome model. Results Overall, DR estimators generally outperform methods that model one or the other components (eg, propensity score or outcome). The DR-MMWS estimator outperforms all other estimators when both the propensity score and outcome models are misspecified and performs equally as well as other DR estimators when only the propensity score is misspecified. Conclusions Health researchers should consider using DR-MMWS as the principal evaluation strategy in observational studies, as this estimator appears to outperform other estimators in its class.

Estimated causal effects of complementary feeding behaviors on early childhood diet quality in a US cohort	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION			English	Article						complementary feeding; child diet quality; birth cohort; causal inference; taste preferences; Project Viva	FOOD FREQUENCY QUESTIONNAIRE; CHILDREN; PREFERENCES; ACCEPTANCE; INFANTS; WEIGHT; IMPACT; ACCEPTABILITY; EXPERIENCE; INFERENCE	Background Complementary feeding (CF) provides an opportunity to shape children's future dietary habits, setting the foundation for good nutrition and health. Objectives We estimated effects of 3 CF behaviors on early childhood diet quality using inverse probability (IP) weighting of marginal structural models (MSMs). Methods Among 1041 children from the Boston-area Project Viva cohort, we estimated effects on the mean Youth Healthy Eating Index (YHEI) score in early childhood of 1) delayed (>= 12 mo) compared with early (<12 mo) introduction of sweets and fruit juice; 2) continued compared with ceased offering of initially refused foods; and 3) early (<12 mo) compared with late (>= 12 mo) introduction of flavor/texture variety. Mothers reported CF behaviors at 1 y and completed FFQs for children in early childhood (median age: 3.1 y). We estimated average treatment effects (ATEs) using IP weighting of MSMs to adjust for both confounding and selection bias due to censored outcomes and examined effect modification by child sex and breastfeeding compared with formula feeding at 6 mo. Results Twelve percent of mothers delayed introducing sweets/fruit juice, 93% continued offering initially refused foods, and 32% introduced flavor/texture variety early. The mean +/- SD YHEI score was 52.8 +/- 9.2 points. In adjusted models, we estimated a higher mean YHEI score with delayed (compared with early) sweets and fruit juice among breastfeeding children (ATE: 4.5 points; 95% CI: 1.0, 7.4 points), as well as with continued (compared with ceased) offering of refused foods among females (ATE: 5.4 points; 95% CI: 0.8, 9.1 points). The ATE for early (compared with late) flavor/texture variety was 1.7 points (95% CI: 0.3, 3.2 points) overall and stronger (2.8 points; 95% CI: 0.7, 5.1 points) among the formula-fed group. Conclusions Delayed introduction of sweets/juice, continued offering of refused foods, and early flavor/texture variety may all result in higher childhood diet quality. Effects may depend on child sex and infant breastfeeding status.

Nested doubly robust estimating equations for causal analysis with an incomplete effect modifier	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF STATISTICS-REVUE CANADIENNE DE STATISTIQUE			English	Article						Double robustness; effect modification; incomplete data; potential outcome; propensity score	PROPENSITY SCORE; MISSING DATA; INFERENCE; MODELS	Inference regarding exposure effects within subgroups of individuals and regarding the effect-modifying role of some covariates plays a central role in research on stratified medicine. Large administrative databases offer an appealing basis for investigating these questions but causal inference can be challenging due to confounding and missing data. We consider the setting where subgroups are defined by the value of an incompletely observed potential effect modifier. We first formulate simple doubly inverse probability-weighted estimating equations involving one weight to facilitate causal inference with complete data and another weight to adjust for the fact that the effect modifier is only partially observed. We then develop a nested doubly robust (NDR) estimating function which is shown to yield more efficient and robust estimators. In simulation studies, both approaches are shown to yield valid inference in finite samples, but the advantages of the NDR estimators are evident when one or more of the auxiliary models are misspecified. An application to a study of the effect of biological therapy on inflammation in a rheumatology cohort is given for illustration.

Power and sample size for observational studies of point exposure effects	BIOMETRICS			English	Article						causal inference; design effect; effective sample size; H&#225; jek estimator; inverse probability weighting; marginal structural modeling	PROPENSITY SCORE ESTIMATION; MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; CAUSAL; REGRESSION; CALCULUS	Inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTWs) are commonly used to control for confounding when estimating causal effects of point exposures from observational data. When planning a study that will be analyzed with IPTWs, determining the required sample size for a given level of statistical power is challenging because of the effect of weighting on the variance of the estimated causal means. This paper considers the utility of the design effect to quantify the effect of weighting on the precision of causal estimates. The design effect is defined as the ratio of the variance of the causal mean estimator divided by the variance of a naive estimator if, counter to fact, no confounding had been present and weights were not needed. A simple, closed-form approximation of the design effect is derived that is outcome invariant and can be estimated during the study design phase. Once the design effect is approximated for each treatment group, sample size calculations are conducted as for a randomized trial, but with variances inflated by the design effects to account for weighting. Simulations demonstrate the accuracy of the design effect approximation, and practical considerations are discussed.

We reviewed recent ITS investigations on health topics for determining 1) the data management strategies and statistical analysis performed, 2) how often missing data were considered and, if so, how they were evaluated, reported and handled. Study Design and Setting: This was a scoping review following standard recommendations from the PRISMA Extension for Scoping Reviews. We included a random sample of all ITS studies that assessed any intervention relevant to health care (eg, policies or programmes) with individual-level data, published in 2019, with abstracts indexed on MEDLINE. Results: From 732 studies identified, we finally reviewed 60. Reporting of missing data was rare. Data aggregation, statistical tools for modelling population-level data and complete case analyses were preferred, but these can lead to bias when data are missing at random. Seasonality and other time-dependent confounders were rarely accounted for and, when they were, missing data implications were typically ignored. Very few studies reflected on the consequences of missing data. Conclusion: Handling and reporting of missing data in recent ITS studies performed for health research have many shortcomings compared with best practice.

Estimating treatment effects with partially observed covariates using outcome regression with missing indicators	BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						average treatment effect; missing confounder data; missing covariate data; missing indicator; outcome regression	PROPENSITY SCORE; CAUSAL; INFERENCE; VALUES	Missing data is a common issue in research using observational studies to investigate the effect of treatments on health outcomes. When missingness occurs only in the covariates, a simple approach is to use missing indicators to handle the partially observed covariates. The missing indicator approach has been criticized for giving biased results in outcome regression. However, recent papers have suggested that the missing indicator approach can provide unbiased results in propensity score analysis under certain assumptions. We consider assumptions under which the missing indicator approach can provide valid inferences, namely, (1) no unmeasured confounding within missingness patterns; either (2a) covariate values of patients with missing data were conditionally independent of treatment or (2b) these values were conditionally independent of outcome; and (3) the outcome model is correctly specified: specifically, the true outcome model does not include interactions between missing indicators and fully observed covariates. We prove that, under the assumptions above, the missing indicator approach with outcome regression can provide unbiased estimates of the average treatment effect. We use a simulation study to investigate the extent of bias in estimates of the treatment effect when the assumptions are violated and we illustrate our findings using data from electronic health records. In conclusion, the missing indicator approach can provide valid inferences for outcome regression, but the plausibility of its assumptions must first be considered carefully.

J	Austin, PC; Stuart, EA				Austin, Peter C.; Stuart, Elizabeth A.			The performance of inverse probability of treatment weighting and full matching on the propensity score in the presence of model misspecification when estimating the effect of treatment on survival outcomes	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Propensity score; full matching; inverse probability of treatment weighting; Monte Carlo simulations; observational studies; bias; IPTW	CRITICAL-APPRAISAL; INFERENCE; NUMBER	There is increasing interest in estimating the causal effects of treatments using observational data. Propensity-score matching methods are frequently used to adjust for differences in observed characteristics between treated and control individuals in observational studies. Survival or time-to-event outcomes occur frequently in the medical literature, but the use of propensity score methods in survival analysis has not been thoroughly investigated. This paper compares two approaches for estimating the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) on survival outcomes: Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) and full matching. The performance of these methods was compared in an extensive set of simulations that varied the extent of confounding and the amount of misspecification of the propensity score model. We found that both IPTW and full matching resulted in estimation of marginal hazard ratios with negligible bias when the ATE was the target estimand and the treatment-selection process was weak to moderate. However, when the treatment-selection process was strong, both methods resulted in biased estimation of the true marginal hazard ratio, even when the propensity score model was correctly specified. When the propensity score model was correctly specified, bias tended to be lower for full matching than for IPTW. The reasons for these biases and for the differences between the two methods appeared to be due to some extreme weights generated for each method. Both methods tended to produce more extreme weights as the magnitude of the effects of covariates on treatment selection increased. Furthermore, more extreme weights were observed for IPTW than for full matching. However, the poorer performance of both methods in the presence of a strong treatment-selection process was mitigated by the use of IPTW with restriction and full matching with a caliper restriction when the propensity score model was correctly specified.

These studies have included both cross-sectional comparisons across communities and rime-series analyses over time in single communities. Time-series analysis offers certain advantages, primarily in that the study population is the same over time, so that it acts as its own ''control.'' However, modeling such data is complicated by the fact that other environmental factors and other causes of illness can confound the results unless they are adequately addressed. For example, wintertime influenza epidemics cause long-wave peaks in respiratory mortality, and variations in emissions, dispersion, and atmospheric chemistry can cause seasonal cycles in pollution. Such superimposed long-wave variations in both health outcomes and pollutant concentrations can undermine the statistical validity of time-series models by inducing autocorrelation, and can create long-wave ''noise'' signals that can overwhelm a short-term ''signal'' of interest. Also, model specification can strongly affect the results of a time-series model. For example, analyses focusing on only one routinely collected pollution metric, to the exclusion of other possibly more influential pollution components, can cause the effects of the overlooked pollutants to be ascribed to the studied pollutant. In addition, the potential effects of nonnormal (e.g., Poisson) data distributions on time-series results need to be considered. It is concluded that how these various time-series modeling factors are, or are not, addressed can have a large influence on the study conclusions, or the ''message'' resulting from such analyses. Sensitivity analyses incorporating multiple modeling methods and model specifications are therefore recommended as part of such an analysis. Moreover, in this article exploratory and diagnostic procedures are recommended that may aid the modeler in assessing and avoiding the noted problems and that will allow the validity of such studies to be more easily documented and intercompared.

We study the problem of imperfect measurements of the binary instrumental variable, treatment and outcome. We first consider nondifferential measurement errors, that is, the mismeasured variable does not depend on other variables given its true value. We show that the measurement error of the instrumental variable does not bias the estimate, that the measurement error of the treatment biases the estimate away from zero, and that the measurement error of the outcome biases the estimate toward zero. Moreover, we derive sharp bounds on the causal effects without additional assumptions. These bounds are informative because they exclude zero. We then consider differential measurement errors, and focus on sensitivity analyses in those settings.

J	Gustafson, P				Gustafson, Paul			Sample size implications when biases are modelled rather than ignored	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY			English	Article						Bayesian inference; bias; epidemiology; measurement error; misclassification; non-identified model; observational studies; residual confounding; sample size; study design	SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; IDENTIFIABILITY; UNCERTAINTY	Realistic statistical modelling of observational data often suggests a statistical model which is not fully identified, owing to potential biases that are not under the control of study investigators. Bayesian inference can be implemented with such a model, ideally with the most precise prior knowledge that can be ascertained. However, as a consequence of the non-identifiability, inference cannot be made arbitrarily accurate by choosing the sample size to be sufficiently large. In turn, this has consequences for sample size determination. The paper presents a sample size criterion that is based on a quantification of how much Bayesian learning can arise in a given non-identified model. A global perspective is adopted, whereby choosing larger sample sizes for some studies necessarily implies that some other potentially worthwhile studies cannot be undertaken. This suggests that smaller sample sizes should be selected with non-identified models, as larger sample sizes constitute a squandering of resources in making estimator variances very small compared with their biases. Particularly, consider two investigators planning the same study, one of whom admits to the potential biases at hand and consequently uses a non-identified model, whereas the other pretends that there are no biases, leading to an identified but less realistic model. It is seen that the former investigator always selects a smaller sample size than the latter, with the difference being quite marked in some illustrative cases.

SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						New Zealand; unemployment; suicidal behaviour; substance abuse; crime; longitudinal study	LONGITUDINAL DATA-ANALYSIS; SUICIDE ATTEMPTS; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDER; HEALTH CONSEQUENCES; ANTISOCIAL-BEHAVIOR; YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT; MENTAL-HEALTH; BIRTH COHORT; RISK-FACTORS; CHILDHOOD	This study investigates the relationships between unemployment following school leaving and psychosocial adjustment problems (mental health, substance use, crime, suicidal behaviours and teenage pregnancy) in a birth cohort of over 1000 New Zealand born young people. The data were gathered during the course of the Christchurch Health and Development Study (CHDS). The CHDS is a longitudinal study of a birth cohort of 1265 children born in the Christchurch (NZ) urban region who have been studied from birth to age 21. Data were gathered by personal interview on: (a) exposure to unemployment and (b) personal adjustment over the period from age 16 to age 21. Measures of personal adjustment included mental health (depression, anxiety), substance use, crime, suicidal behaviours and (for females) teenage pregnancy. Data were analysed using a fixed effects regression model that took into account both observed and non-observed sources of confounding and the possibility of reverse causal associations between personal adjustment and unemployment. Before adjustment for confounding and reverse causality there were significant (p <0.001) associations between exposure to unemployment and measures of mental health, substance use, crime, suicidal behaviours and teenage pregnancy. Adjustment for confounding factors and reverse causality reduced these associations quite substantially and after control for sources of confounding a number of associations became nonsignificant. Nonetheless, after such control, exposure to unemployment remained significantly (p <0.05) associated with suicidal ideation, substance abuse and criminal behaviours. It is concluded that, in part, the associations between unemployment and personal adjustment are spurious and reflect the presence of confounding factors that are related to both unemployment and adjustment. Nonetheless, the findings suggest that exposure to unemployment may be associated with increased risks of suicidal thoughts, crime and substance use. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Methods: Data were analyzed for 52,326 women in the Women's Health Initiative Clinical Trials (CT) Cohort and 68,169 women in the Observational Study (OS) Cohort after exclusions. We included follow-up to 2005, resulting in a median duration of 7.6 years of follow up after enrollment. Results from three multivariable Cox models were compared to those from marginal structural models that included time varying measures of antidepressant medication use, presence of elevated depressive symptoms and BMI, while adjusting for potential confounders including age, ethnicity, education, minutes of recreational physical activity per week, total energy intake, hormone therapy use, family history of diabetes and smoking status. Results: Our results are consistent with previous studies examining the relationship of antidepressant medication use and risk of type 2 diabetes. All models showed a significant increase in diabetes risk for those taking antidepressants. The Cox Proportional Hazards models using baseline covariates showed the lowest increase in risk, with hazard ratios of 1.19 (95 % CI 1.06-1.35) and 1.14 (95 % CI 1.01-1.30) in the OS and CT, respectively. Hazard ratios from marginal structural models comparing antidepressant users to non-users were 1.35 (95 % CI 1.21-1.51) and 1.27 (95 % CI 1.13-1.43) in the WHI OS and CT, respectively - however, differences among estimates from traditional Cox models and marginal structural models were not statistically significant in both cohorts. One explanation suggests that time-dependent confounding was not a substantial factor in these data, however other explanations exist. Unadjusted Cox Proportional Hazards models showed that women with elevated depressive symptoms had a significant increase in diabetes risk that remained after adjustment for confounders. However, this association missed the threshold for statistical significance in propensity score adjusted and marginal structural models. Conclusions: Results from the multiple approaches provide further evidence of an increase in risk of type 2 diabetes for those on antidepressants.

In particular, results from conventional time to pregnancy studies can be driven by the many sources of bias inherent in these studies. By prospectively collecting detailed records of menstrual bleeding, occurrences of intercourse, and a marker of ovulation day in each menstrual cycle, precise information on exposure effects can be obtained, adjusting for many of the primary sources of bias. This article provides an overview of the different types of study designs, focusing on the data required, the practical advantages and disadvantages of each design, and the statistical methods required to take fall advantage of the available data. We conclude that detailed prospective studies allowing inferences on day specific probabilities of conception should be considered as the gold standard for studying the effects of environmental exposures on fertility.

Attendance of cultural events and involvement with the arts-impact evaluation on health and well-being from a Swiss household panel survey	PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Engagement with the arts; Cultural participation and attendance; Health; Well-being; Longitudinal survey data; Causative relationship	LIFE	Objectives: Although there is strong uptake of active or passive engagement with the cultural and creative activities as determinants of individual health, well-being and social participation, few population studies report any causal influence on self-reported and physical health or life satisfaction from voluntary engagement with the arts (playing an instrument or singing, painting, sculpture) or passive cultural participation (attending the cinema, theatre, opera and exhibitions). This study set out to investigate any potential derived benefits to the Swiss population. Study design: The 2010 and 2013 waves of the Swiss Household Panel study were used for analysis. The data are representative for the Swiss population aged 14 years and older with respect to major demographic variables. Methods: Using longitudinal data, the strengths of the two approaches to evaluating causal inference were simultaneously applied: propensity score matching and difference-indifferences. Propensity score matching attempted to eliminate selection bias by conditioning on confounding variables. Difference-in-differences estimator was applied to remove unobserved fixed effects via intra-individual comparisons over time by comparing the trends in a matched treatment and control group. Results: The study showed that voluntary cultural activity of any type, passive or active-did not seem to have any causative influence on health and well-being. Results showed that long-term health and well-being did not improve significantly as a result of any specific activity in the cultural arena. Conclusions: The investigation provided little evidence to justify health promotion messages for involvement with the arts. Nevertheless, these findings do not contest that active or passive participation in cultural-and arts-related activities may be beneficial to health and well-being when guided by qualified therapists to treat specific health-related problems.

J	Gamble, JF; Nicolich, MJ; Boffetta, P				Gamble, John F.; Nicolich, Mark J.; Boffetta, Paolo			Lung cancer and diesel exhaust: an updated critical review of the occupational epidemiology literature	CRITICAL REVIEWS IN TOXICOLOGY			English	Review						Cumulative exposure; diesel exhaust; elemental carbon; epidemiology; exposure-response; latency; lung cancer; odds ratio	URBAN BUS DRIVERS; NONDIFFERENTIAL MISCLASSIFICATION; RAILROAD WORKERS; MOTOR EXHAUST; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; MAINTENANCE WORKERS; PARTICULATE MATTER; MODEL UNCERTAINTY; ENGINE EMISSIONS; POOLED ANALYSIS	A recent review concluded that the evidence from epidemiology studies was indeterminate and that additional studies were required to support the diesel exhaust-lung cancer hypothesis. This updated review includes seven recent studies. Two population-based studies concluded that significant exposure-response (E-R) trends between cumulative diesel exhaust and lung cancer were unlikely to be entirely explained by bias or confounding. Those studies have quality data on life-style risk factors, but do not allow definitive conclusions because of inconsistent E-R trends, qualitative exposure estimates and exposure misclassification (insufficient latency based on job title), and selection bias from low participation rates. Non-definitive results are consistent with the larger body of population studies. An NCI/NIOSH cohort mortality and nested case-control study of non-metal miners have some surrogate-based quantitative diesel exposure estimates (including highest exposure measured as respirable elemental carbon (REC) in the workplace) and smoking histories. The authors concluded that diesel exhaust may cause lung cancer. Nonetheless, the results are non-definitive because the conclusions are based on E-R patterns where high exposures were deleted to achieve significant results, where a posteriori adjustments were made to augment results, and where inappropriate adjustments were made for the "negative confounding" effects of smoking even though current smoking was not associated with diesel exposure and therefore could not be a confounder. Three cohort studies of bus drivers and truck drivers are in effect air pollution studies without estimates of diesel exhaust exposure and so are not sufficient for assessing the lung cancer-diesel exhaust hypothesis. Results from all occupational cohort studies with quantitative estimates of exposure have limitations, including weak and inconsistent E-R associations that could be explained by bias, confounding or chance, exposure misclassification, and often inadequate latency. In sum, the weight of evidence is considered inadequate to confirm the diesel-lung cancer hypothesis.

However, assessing the relationship between various hormonal contraceptive methods and HIV acquisition with observational data involves substantial analytic design issues and challenges. Studies to date have used inconsistent approaches and generated a body of evidence that is complex and challenging to interpret. Methods: In January 2013, the United States Agency for International Development and FHI 360 supported a meeting of epidemiologists, statisticians, and content experts to develop recommendations for future observational analyses of hormonal contraception and HIV acquisition. Results: Meeting participants generated recommendations regarding careful definition of exposure groups; handling potential confounders, mediators, and effect modifiers; estimating and addressing the magnitude of measurement error; using multiple methods to account for pregnancy; and exploring the potential for differential exposure to HIV-infected partners. Advantages and disadvantages of various statistical approaches to account for time-varying confounding and estimating total and direct effects were also discussed. Conclusion: Implementing these recommendations in future observational hormonal contraception-HIV acquisition analyses will enhance interpretation of existing studies and strengthen the overall evidence base for this complex and important area.

Here, we propose KnockoffTrio, a statistical method to identify putative causal genetic variants for father-mother-child trio design built upon a recently developed knockoff framework in statistics. KnockoffTrio controls the false discovery rate (FDR) in the presence of arbitrary correlations among tests and is less conservative and thus more powerful than the conventional methods that control the family-wise error rate via Bonferroni correction. Furthermore, KnockoffTrio is not restricted to family-based association tests and can be used in conjunction with more powerful, potentially nonlinear models to improve the power of standard family-based tests. We show, using empirical simulations, that KnockoffTrio can prioritize causal variants over associations due to linkage disequilibrium and can provide protection against confounding due to population stratification. In applications to 14,200 trios from three study cohorts for autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), including AGP, SPARK, and SSC, we show that KnockoffTrio can identify multiple significant associations that are missed by conventional tests applied to the same data. In particular, we replicate known ASD association signals with variants in several genes such as MACROD2, NRXN1, PRKARIB, CADM2, PCDH9, and DOCK4 and identify additional associations with variants in other genes including ARHGEF10, SLC28A1, ZNF589, and HINT1 at FDR 10%.

Prognostic score-based balance measures can be a useful diagnostic for propensity score methods in comparative effectiveness research	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Causal inference; Confounding; Disease risk score; Matching methods; Nonexperimental study; Propensity score diagnostics	DISEASE RISK SCORES; ADJUSTMENT; SELECTION	Objective: Examining covariate balance is the prescribed method for determining the degree to which propensity score methods should be successful at reducing bias. This study assessed the performance of various balance measures, including a proposed balance measure based on the prognostic score (similar to a disease risk score), to determine which balance measures best correlate with bias in the treatment effect estimate. Study Design and Setting: The correlations of multiple common balance measures with bias in the treatment effect estimate produced by weighting by the odds, subclassification on the propensity score, and full matching on the propensity score were calculated. Simulated data were used, based on realistic data settings. Settings included both continuous and binary covariates and continuous covariates only. Results: The absolute standardized mean difference (ASMD) in prognostic scores, the mean ASMD (in covariates), and the mean t-statistic all had high correlations with bias in the effect estimate. Overall, prognostic scores displayed the highest correlations with bias of all the balance measures considered. Prognostic score measure performance was generally not affected by model misspecification, and the prognostic score measure performed well under a variety of scenarios. Conclusion: Researchers should consider using prognostic score-based balance measures for assessing the performance of propensity score methods for reducing bias in nonexperimental studies.

We show that these allow for effect decomposition under weaker identification conditions than population natural direct and indirect effects. When no confounders of the mediator-outcome association are affected by the exposure, identification is possible under essentially the same conditions as for controlled direct effects. Otherwise, identification is still possible with additional knowledge on a nonidentifiable selection-bias function which measures the dependence of the mediator effect on the observed exposure within confounder levels, and which evaluates to zero in a large class of realistic data-generating mechanisms. We argue that natural direct and indirect effects on the exposed are of intrinsic interest in various applications. We moreover show that they coincide with the corresponding population natural direct and indirect effects when the exposure is randomly assigned. In such settings, our results are thus also of relevance for assessing population natural direct and indirect effects in the presence of exposure-induced mediator-outcome confounding, which existing methodology has not been able to address.

In observational studies, treatment assignment may depend on observed covariates. If these confounding variables are not accounted for properly, the inference based on the Cox proportional hazard model may perform poorly. As shown in Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983), under the strongly ignorable treatment assignment assumption, conditioning on the propensity score yields valid causal effect estimates. Therefore we incorporate the propensity score into the Cox model for causal inference with survival data. We derive the asymptotic property of the maximum partial likelihood estimator when the model is correctly specified. Simulation results show that our method performs quite well for observational data. The approach is applied to a real dataset on the time of readmission of trauma patients. We also derive the asymptotic property of the maximum partial likelihood estimator with a robust variance estimator, when the model is incorrectly specified.

Bayesian propensity score analysis for observational data	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						confounding; bias; observational studies; causal inference; Bayesian statistics	MODEL	In the analysis of observational data, stratifying patients on the estimated propensity scores reduces confounding from measured variables. Confidence intervals for the treatment effect are typically calculated without acknowledging uncertainty in the estimated propensity scores, and intuitively this may yield inferences, which are falsely precise. In this paper, we describe a Bayesian method that models the propensity score as a latent variable. We consider observational studies with a dichotomous treatment, dichotomous outcome, and measured confounders, where the log odds ratio is the measure of effect. Markov chain Monte Carlo is used for posterior simulation. We study the impact of modelling uncertainty in the propensity scores in a case study investigating the effect of statin therapy on mortality in Ontario patients discharged from hospital following acute myocardial infarction. Our analysis reveals that the Bayesian credible interval for the treatment effect is 10 per cent wider compared with a conventional propensity score analysis. Using simulations, we show that when the association between treatment and confounders is weak, then this increases uncertainty in the estimated propensity scores. Bayesian interval estimates for the treatment effect are longer on average, though there is little improvement in coverage probability. A novel feature of the proposed method is that it tits models for the treatment and outcome simultaneously rather than one at a time. The method uses the outcome variable to inform the fit of the propensity model. We explore the performance of the estimated propensity scores using cross-validation.

The aim of this scoping review was to summarize current methodologies of negative controls (both negative control exposure [NCE] and negative control outcome [NCO]).Study Design and Setting: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library (up to March 9, 2023) for articles on methodologies of negative controls. Two reviewers selected eligible studies and collected relevant data independently and in duplicate. We reported total numbers and percentages, and summarized methodologies narratively.Results: A total of 37 relevant methodological articles were included in our review. These publications covered NCE (n = 11, 29.8%), NCO (n = 13, 35.1%), or both (n = 13, 35.1%), with most focused on bias detection (n = 14, 37.8%), bias correction (n = 16, 43.3%), and P value or confidence interval (CI) calibration (n = 5, 13.5%). For the two remaining articles (5.4%), one discussed bias detection and P value or CI calibration and the other covered all the three functions. For bias detection, the existence of an association between the NCE (NCO) and outcome (exposure) variables of interest simply indicates that results may suffer from confounding bias, selection bias and/or information bias. For bias correction, however, the algorithms of negative control methods need more stringent assumptions such as rank preservation, monotonicity, and linearity.Conclusion: Negative controls can be leveraged for bias detection, P value or CI calibration, and bias correction, among which bias correction has been the most studied methodologically. The current available methods need some stringent assumptions to detect or remove bias. More methodological research is needed to optimize the use of negative controls. recommend proper use of negative control methods to mitigate biases in epidemiological studies. Meanwhile, more methodological research is also needed to optimize the use of negative controls.(c) 2023 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

J	Williamson, E; Morley, R; Lucas, A; Carpenter, J				Williamson, Elizabeth; Morley, Ruth; Lucas, Alan; Carpenter, James			Propensity scores: From naive enthusiasm to intuitive understanding	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						confounding; inverse probability weighting; matching; observational study; propensity score; stratification	MEDICAL LITERATURE; CRITICAL-APPRAISAL; VARIABLE SELECTION; BIAS REDUCTION; REGRESSION; PERFORMANCE; STATISTICS; STRATIFICATION; AUSTIN,PETER; ADJUSTMENT	Estimation of the effect of a binary exposure on an outcome in the presence of confounding is often carried out via outcome regression modelling. An alternative approach is to use propensity score methodology. The propensity score is the conditional probability of receiving the exposure given the observed covariates and can be used, under the assumption of no unmeasured confounders, to estimate the causal effect of the exposure. In this article, we provide a non-technical and intuitive discussion of propensity score methodology, motivating the use of the propensity score approach by analogy with randomised studies, and describe the four main ways in which this methodology can be implemented. We carefully describe the population parameters being estimated - an issue that is frequently overlooked in the medical literature. We illustrate these four methods using data from a study investigating the association between maternal choice to provide breast milk and the infant's subsequent neurodevelopment. We outline useful extensions of propensity score methodology and discuss directions for future research. Propensity score methods remain controversial and there is no consensus as to when, if ever, they should be used in place of traditional outcome regression models. We therefore end with a discussion of the relative advantages and disadvantages of each.

J	le Cessie, S				le Cessie, Saskia			Bias Formulas for Estimating Direct and Indirect Effects When Unmeasured Confounding Is Present	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							MEDIATION ANALYSIS; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; MEASUREMENT-ERROR; MISCLASSIFICATION	Mediation analysis examines the influence of intermediate factors in the causal pathway between an exposure and an outcome. It yields estimates of the direct effect of the exposure on the outcome and of the indirect effect through the intermediate variable. Both estimates can be biased if the relationship between the mediator and the outcome is confounded. In this article, we study the effect of unmeasured confounding on direct and indirect effect estimates for a continuous mediator and an outcome that may be either binary, count, or continuous. We formulate the effect of the confounder on the intermediate and on the outcome directly in regression models, which makes the formulas intuitive to use by applied users. The formulas are derived under the assumption that the confounder follows a normal distribution. In simulations, the formulas for a linear response model performed well, also as it did when the unmeasured confounder was binary. For a rare binary outcome, the formulas for logistic regression performed well if the unmeasured confounder followed a normal distribution, but for a binary confounder the bias in the direct effect was overcorrected. We applied the formulas to data from a case-control study (Leiden Thrombophilia Study) on risk factors for venous thrombosis. This showed that unmeasured confounding can severely bias the estimates of direct and indirect effects.

The approach need not use a complete Causal diagram as long as it is known that known covariate set Z contains the parent set of the exposure E. On the other a hand, whether a covariate is or not a confounder may depend on its categorization. We introduce uniform non-confounding which implies non-confounding in any subpopulation defined by the interval of a covariate (or any pooled level for a discrete covariate). We show that the conditions in Miettinen and Cook's criteria for non-confounding also imply uniform non-con founding. Further we present an algorithm for deleting non-confounders from the potential confounder set Z, which extends Greenland et al.'s [1999a. Causal diagrams for epidemiologic research. Epidemiology 10, 37-48] approach by splitting Z into a series of potential confounder subsets. We also discuss conditions for non-confounding bias in the subpopulations in which we are interested, where the subpopulations may be defined by non-con founders. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Multipollutant Measurement Error in Air Pollution Epidemiology Studies Arising from Predicting Exposures with Penalized Regression Splines	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Air pollution epidemiology; Measurement error bias; Multipollutant measurement; Penalized regression splines	SPATIAL MISALIGNMENT; LEAST-SQUARES; HEALTH; MODEL	Air pollution epidemiology studies are trending towards a multipollutant approach. In these studies, exposures at subject locations are unobserved and must be predicted by using observed exposures at misaligned monitoring locations. This induces measurement error, which can bias the estimated health effects and affect standard error estimates. We characterize this measurement error and develop an analytic bias correction when using penalized regression splines to predict exposure. Our simulations show that bias from multipollutant measurement error can be severe, and in opposite directions or simultaneously positive or negative. Our analytic bias correction combined with a non-parametric bootstrap yields accurate coverage of 95% confidence intervals. We apply our methodology to analyse the association of systolic blood pressure with PM2.5 and NO2 levels in the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Sister Study. We find that NO2 confounds the association of systolic blood pressure with PM2.5 levels and vice versa. Elevated systolic blood pressure was significantly associated with increased PM2.5 and decreased NO2 levels. Correcting for measurement error bias strengthened these associations and widened 95% confidence intervals.

A review and empirical comparison of causal inference methods for clustered observational data with application to the evaluation of the effectiveness of medical devices	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Review						Observational studies; propensity scores; clustering; orthopedics; medical devices	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; PROPENSITY SCORE METHODS; INVERSE PROBABILITY; SURVIVAL-DATA; SENSITIVITY; HETEROGENEITY; OUTCOMES; BALANCE; TIME; SELECTION	Observational studies are commonplace in medicine. A frequent concern is confounding bias due to differences in patient characteristics across treatment groups, but other important issues include dependency among observations nested within clusters (e.g. patients clustered within physicians or surgeons) and confounding due to cluster characteristics (e.g. physician or surgeon experience or training). Given the frequency with which these issues arise in medical research, as well as their relative complexity, methods for the analysis of clustered observational data are reviewed. We argue for estimating causal treatment effects using marginal models that either match or weight observations using a suitable distance metric (e.g. the propensity score). Simulation results demonstrated that methods incorporating clustering into calculation of the variance were generally more accurate than those that did not. Moreover, methods that account for cluster confounding when estimating the treatment effect were least biased and most accurate. Throughout the paper we illustrate the proposed methods in a medical device setting that compares the effectiveness of femoral heads used in total hip replacements. Whenever possible the clustered aspect of the data should be considered in the design of the study when constructing the distance measure or in the matching process, as well as in the analysis when estimating the variance of the treatment effect.

J	Xue, HR; Pan, W				Xue, Haoran; Pan, Wei			Inferring causal direction between two traits in the presence of horizontal pleiotropy with GWAS summary data	PLOS GENETICS			English	Article							MULTIVARIABLE MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION; GENETIC-VARIANTS; ASSOCIATION ANALYSES; WIDE ASSOCIATION; DISEASE; CHALLENGES; INFERENCE; RISK; EQTL	Author summary In spite of its importance, due to technical challenges, orienting causal relationships between pairs of traits has been largely under-studied. Mendelian randomization (MR) Steiger's method has become increasingly used in the last two years. Here we point out several limitations with MR Steiger's method and propose alternative approaches. First, MR Steiger's method is based on using only one single SNP as the instrument variable (IV), for which we propose a correlation ratio-based method, called Causal Direction-Ratio, or simply CD-Ratio. An advantage of CD-Ratio is its inference of both the existence and (if so) the direction of a causal relationship, in contrast to MR Steiger's prior assumption of the existence and its poor performance if the assumption is violated. Furthermore, CD-Ratio can be extended to combine the results from multiple, possibly correlated, SNPs with improved statistical power. Second, we propose two methods, called CD-Egger and CD-GLS, for multiple and possibly correlated SNPs while allowing horizontal pleiotropy. Third, we propose three goodness-of-fit tests to check modeling assumptions for the three proposed methods. Finally, we introduce multivariable CD-Egger, analogous to multivariable MR, as a more robust approach, and an extension of CD-Ratio to cases with possibly bi-directional causal relationships. Our numerical studies demonstrated superior performance of our proposed methods over MR Steiger and bi-directional MR. Our proposed methods, along with freely available software, are expected to be useful in practice for causal inference. Orienting the causal relationship between pairs of traits is a fundamental task in scientific research with significant implications in practice, such as in prioritizing molecular targets and modifiable risk factors for developing therapeutic and interventional strategies for complex diseases. A recent method, called Steiger's method, using a single SNP as an instrument variable (IV) in the framework of Mendelian randomization (MR), has since been widely applied. We report the following new contributions. First, we propose a single SNP-based alternative, overcoming a severe limitation of Steiger's method in simply assuming, instead of inferring, the existence of a causal relationship. We also clarify a condition necessary for the validity of the methods in the presence of hidden confounding. Second, to improve statistical power, we propose combining the results from multiple, and possibly correlated, SNPs as multiple instruments. Third, we develop three goodness-of-fit tests to check modeling assumptions, including those required for valid IVs. Fourth, by relaxing one of the three IV assumptions in MR, we propose several methods, including an Egger regression-like approach and its multivariable version (analogous to multivariable MR), to account for horizontal pleiotropy of the SNPs/IVs, which is often unavoidable in practice. All our methods can simultaneously infer both the existence and (if so) the direction of a causal relationship, largely expanding their applicability over that of Steiger's method. Although we focus on uni-directional causal relationships, we also briefly discuss an extension to bi-directional relationships. Through extensive simulations and an application to infer the causal directions between low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and coronary artery disease (CAD), we demonstrate the superior performance and advantage of our proposed methods over Steiger's method and bi-directional MR. In particular, after accounting for horizontal pleiotropy, our method confirmed the well known causal direction from LDL to CAD, while other methods, including bi-directional MR, might fail.

J	Xue, HR; Shen, XT; Pan, W				Xue, Haoran; Shen, Xiaotong; Pan, Wei			Constrained maximum likelihood-based Mendelian randomization robust to both correlated and uncorrelated pleiotropic effects	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS			English	Article							INVALID INSTRUMENTS; GENETIC ARCHITECTURE; MODEL SELECTION; LOCI; ASSOCIATION; REGRESSION; FRAMEWORK; PROVIDES	With the increasing availability of large-scale GWAS summary data on various complex traits and diseases, there have been tremendous interests in applications of Mendelian randomization (MR) to investigate causal relationships between pairs of traits using SNPs as instrumental variables (IVs) based on observational data. In spite of the potential significance of such applications, the validity of their causal conclusions critically depends on some strong modeling assumptions required by MR, which may be violated due to the widespread (horizontal) pleiotropy. Although many MR methods have been proposed recently to relax the assumptions by mainly dealing with uncorrelated pleiotropy, only a few can handle correlated pleiotropy, in which some SNPs/IVs may be associated with hidden confounders, such as some heritable factors shared by both traits. Here we propose a simple and effective approach based on constrained maximum likelihood and model averaging, called cML-MA, applicable to GWAS summary data. To deal with more challenging situations with many invalid IVs with only weak pleiotropic effects, we modify and improve it with data perturbation. Extensive simulations demonstrated that the proposed methods could control the type I error rate better while achieving higher power than other competitors. Applications to 48 risk factor-disease pairs based on large-scale GWAS summary data of 3 cardio-metabolic diseases (coronary artery disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes), asthma, and 12 risk factors confirmed its superior performance.

Competing risk bias to explain the inverse relationship between smoking and malignant melanoma	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Bias (Epidemiology); Melanoma; Smoking	CIGARETTE-SMOKING; CAUSAL DIAGRAMS; ALCOHOL; CANCER; SELECTION; SKIN; PROBABILITY; ASSOCIATION; INCIDENT; SURVIVAL	The relationship between smoking and melanoma remains unclear. Among the different results is the paradoxical finding that smoking was shown to be inversely associated with the risk of malignant melanoma in some large cohort and case-control studies, even after control for suspected confounding variables. Smoking is a known risk factor for many non-communicable diseases, including coronary heart disease, stroke, as well as other malignancies; it has been shown to be positively associated with other types of skin cancer, and there remains no clear biologic explanation for a possible protective effect on malignant melanoma. In this paper, we propose a plausible mechanism of bias from smoking-related competing risks that may explain or contribute to the inverse association between smoking and melanoma as spurious. Using directed acyclic graphs for formalization and visualization of assumptions, and Monte Carlo simulation techniques, we demonstrate how published inverse associations might be compatible with selection bias resulting from uncontrolled or unmeasured common causes of competing outcomes of smoking-related diseases and malignant melanoma. We present results from various scenarios assuming a true null as well as a true positive association between smoking and malignant melanoma. Under a true null assumption, we find inverse associations due to the biasing mechanism to be compatible with published results in the literature, especially after the addition of unmeasured confounding variables. This study could be seen as offering a cautionary note in the interpretation of published smoking-melanoma findings.

The authors concluded that MWHs reduce perinatal mortality by over 80% and should be incorporated into routine maternal health care services. In the present article, we illustrate that due to the contextual and methodological heterogeneity present in existing studies, the authors' conclusions about the effectiveness of MWHs in reducing perinatal mortality were likely overstated. Additionally, we argue that because of the selection bias and confounding inherent in observational studies, unadjusted pooled estimates provide little causal evidence for effectiveness. Additional studies with robust designs are required before an appropriately designed meta-analysis can be conducted; until then, the ability to draw causal inferences regarding the effectiveness of MWHs in reducing perinatal mortality is limited.

Multipollutant measurement error in air pollution epidemiology studies arising from predicting exposures with penalized regression splines	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Air pollution epidemiology; Measurement error bias; Multipollutant measurement; Penalized regression splines	SPATIAL MISALIGNMENT; LEAST-SQUARES; HEALTH; MODEL	Air pollution epidemiology studies are trending towards a multipollutant approach. In these studies, exposures at subject locations are unobserved and must be predicted by using observed exposures at misaligned monitoring locations. This induces measurement error, which can bias the estimated health effects and affect standard error estimates. We characterize this measurement error and develop an analytic bias correction when using penalized regression splines to predict exposure. Our simulations show that bias from multipollutant measurement error can be severe, and in opposite directions or simultaneously positive or negative. Our analytic bias correction combined with a non-parametric bootstrap yields accurate coverage of 95% confidence intervals. We apply our methodology to analyse the association of systolic blood pressure with PM2.5 and NO2 levels in the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Sister Study. We find that NO2 confounds the association of systolic blood pressure with PM2.5 levels and vice versa. Elevated systolic blood pressure was significantly associated with increased PM2.5 and decreased NO2 levels. Correcting for measurement error bias strengthened these associations and widened 95% confidence intervals.

J	Stang, A; Poole, C; Kuss, O				Stang, Andreas; Poole, Charles; Kuss, Oliver			The ongoing tyranny of statistical significance testing in biomedical research	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Statistics; P-value; Confidence intervals	P-VALUES; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; TRIAL; WOMEN	Since its introduction into the biomedical literature, statistical significance testing (abbreviated as SST) caused much debate. The aim of this perspective article is to review frequent fallacies and misuses of SST in the biomedical field and to review a potential way out of the fallacies and misuses associated with SSTs. Two frequentist schools of statistical inference merged to form SST as it is practised nowadays: the Fisher and the Neyman-Pearson school. The P-value is both reported quantitatively and checked against the alpha-level to produce a qualitative dichotomous measure (significant/nonsignificant). However, a P-value mixes the estimated effect size with its estimated precision. Obviously, it is not possible to measure these two things with one single number. For the valid interpretation of SSTs, a variety of presumptions and requirements have to be met. We point here to four of them: study size, correct statistical model, correct causal model, and absence of bias and confounding. It has been stated that the P-value is perhaps the most misunderstood statistical concept in clinical research. As in the social sciences, the tyranny of SST is still highly prevalent in the biomedical literature even after decades of warnings against SST. The ubiquitous misuse and tyranny of SST threatens scientific discoveries and may even impede scientific progress. In the worst case, misuse of significance testing may even harm patients who eventually are incorrectly treated because of improper handling of P-values. For a proper interpretation of study results, both estimated effect size and estimated precision are necessary ingredients.

Study Design and Setting: We drew on studies of statistics, epidemiology, and social-science methodology to outline methods for synthesis of QE studies. The design and conduct of QEs, effect sizes from QEs, and moderator variables for the analysis of those effect sizes were discussed. Results: Biases, confounding, design complexities, and comparisons across designs offer serious challenges to syntheses of QEs. Key components of meta-analyses of QEs were identified, including the aspects of QE study design to be coded and analyzed. Of utmost importance are the design and statistical controls implemented in the QEs. Such controls and any potential sources of bias and confounding must be modeled in analyses, along with aspects of the interventions and populations studied. Because of such controls, effect sizes from QEs are more complex than those from randomized experiments. A statistical meta-regression model that incorporates important features of the QEs under review was presented. Conclusion: Meta-analyses of QEs provide particular challenges, but thorough coding of intervention characteristics and study methods, along with careful analysis, should allow for sound inferences.

J	Lipsitch, M				Lipsitch, M			Interpreting results from trials of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines: A statistical test for detecting vaccine-induced increases in carriage of nonvaccine serotypes	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						bacterial vaccines; carrier state; models; statistical; Streptococcus pneumoniae; vaccination; vaccines; conjugate	INFLUENZAE TYPE-B; STREPTOCOCCUS-PNEUMONIAE; HAEMOPHILUS-INFLUENZAE; NASOPHARYNGEAL CARRIAGE; COLONIZATION; FORMULATION; SEROGROUPS; REDUCTION; DISEASE; MODEL	Conjugate vaccines against Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) protect against nasopharyngeal carriage of serotypes included in the vaccine. However, in several clinical trials, vaccinees have shown increased carriage of nonvaccine serotypes of pneumococcus. These increases may be due to serotype replacement, if vaccine-induced protection against carriage of vaccine serotypes increases susceptibility to carriage of nonvaccine serotypes. Alternatively, observed increases may be an artifact of "unmasking" in which nonvaccine serotypes are more readily detected among vaccinees than among controls because vaccine serotypes are not present. In this paper, a statistical test for distinguishing serotype replacement from unmasking is described. The test attempts to reject a null model of unmasking alone; serotype replacement is inferred if the observed increase in detectable nonvaccine serotype carriage among vaccinees is significantly greater than that expected under the null model. Significance is assessed using the Bayesian "posterior predictive p value" as modified by Robins et al. (J Am Sfat Assoc 2000;95:1143-56). Analysis of data from a South African trial suggests that replacement may have occurred in the study, but results do not reach the conventional level of significance in rejecting the null hypothesis of unmasking (p = 0.074). The author performs sensitivity analyses for the prior and for unmeasured confounding by differences in susceptibility to pneumococcus carriage. The implications of the findings and the assumptions and limitations of this technique are then discussed.

J	Otto-Sobotka, F; Peplies, J; Timmer, A				Otto-Sobotka, Fabian; Peplies, Jenny; Timmer, Antje			Modeling determinants of satisfaction with health care in youth with inflammatory bowel disease part 2: semiparametric distributional regression	CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						patient-reported outcomes; generalized additive models for location; scale and shape; two-stage regression; P-splines; model selection	PATIENT SATISFACTION; AGE	Background: Methodological challenges arise with the analysis of patient satisfaction as a measure of health care quality. One of them is the necessity to adjust for differences in patient characteristics or other variables. A combination of several helpful extensions to regression analysis is shown based on patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) to help identify important covariates associated with the distribution of satisfaction. Patients and methods: Analyses were based on cross-sectional data from a postal survey on the health care of patients with IBD aged 15-25, with satisfaction assessed using a 32-item validated questionnaire weighing experience by perceived relevance. The weighted summary score was modeled using a Beta distribution in a generalized additive model for location, scale and shape. Covariates were distinguished in 3 groups and the model was entered in separate, consecutive analyses. First, demographic and disease-related variables were included. Next, information about the IBD specialist was added. The third step added care quality indicators. Results are presented as OR with 95% CI. Results: In the survey, 619 questionnaires were returned and the data set had 453 complete cases for analysis. Satisfaction appeared increased for patients working (OR 1.59, 95% CI: 1.19-2.11) or studying (1.25, 1.00-1.56) as compared to those still at school or in non-academic job training. High anxiety scores and an older age of onset were associated with lower satisfaction. The variation of satisfaction is higher for patients with Crohn's disease or who have statutory insurance (1.19, 1.01-1.40 and 1.22, 1.06-1.40). Conclusion: Modeling the entire distribution of the response uncovered additional influences on the variance of patient satisfaction not previously identified by classical regression. It also resulted in a richer model for the mean. The construction of a combined model for different features of the distribution also helped to improve the control of confounding.

Sufficient Cause Interactions and Statistical Interactions	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							REGRESSION APPROACH; RISK; SYNERGISM; RATIOS	When the outcome and all exposures of interest are binary it is sometimes possible to draw conclusions from empirical data about mechanistic interactions in the sufficient cause sense. Empirical conditions are given for sufficient cause interactions and these conditions are compared with and contrasted to interaction coefficients in linear, log-linear and logistic regression models. Conditions that suffice to allow for the interpretation of statistical interactions as sufficient cause interactions are derived. Discussion is presented concerning the implications of the inclusion of confounding variables in the model.

Design: Population-based registry study. Setting: Auvergne ectopic pregnancy registry (France). Patient(s): Women (n = 641) registered between 1997 and 2000. Intervention(s): Standard treatment of ectopic pregnancy. Main Outcome Measure(s): Based on the Psychiatric Epidemiology Life Events Scale, we analyzed the nonresponse bias, the confounding effects of sociobehavioral factors associated with both life events and ectopic pregnancy, and the potential buffering effects of socio-cultural variables. A multivariate model was constructed to test the association between life events and ectopic pregnancy, adjusting for identified confounders and testing interactions. Result(s): The primary hypothesis that life events might be independent risk factors for ectopic pregnancy was not confirmed in this study, which nevertheless illustrated the numerous biases and measurement problems confronting association studies of life events with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Conclusion(s): Recommendations are made for future studies on life events and adverse pregnancy outcomes to avoid most selection, information, and confounding biases. Methodological improvements are needed for measurement of life events to develop measures that more closely consider the consequences of stress and the mechanisms of buffering.

CHEAR Metabol Anal Team	Quantitative methods for metabolomic analyses evaluated in the Children's Health Exposure Analysis Resource (CHEAR)	JOURNAL OF EXPOSURE SCIENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						NMR; Targeted metabolomics; Dimension reduction; Feature selection; Collinearity; CHEAR	CHEMICAL-MIXTURES; WIDE ASSOCIATION; PROFILE	With advances in technologies that facilitate metabolome-wide analyses, the incorporation of metabolomics in the pursuit of biomarkers of exposure and effect is rapidly evolving in population health studies. However, many analytic approaches are limited in their capacity to address high-dimensional metabolomics data within an epidemiologic framework, including the highly collinear nature of the metabolites and consideration of confounding variables. In this Children's Health Exposure Analysis Resource (CHEAR) network study, we showcase various analytic approaches that are established as well as novel in the field of metabolomics, including univariate single metabolite models, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), random forest, weighted quantile sum (WQS(Rs)) regression, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and latent class analysis (LCA). Here, in a Bangladeshi birth cohort (n = 199), we illustrate research questions that can be addressed by each analytic method in the assessment of associations between cord blood metabolites (H-1 NMR measurements) and birth anthropometric measurements (birth weight and head circumference).

Sensitivity analyses for average treatment effects when outcome is censored by death in instrumental variable models	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						causal inference; covariate balancing propensity score; neonatal intensive care; nonmortality outcome; observational study; perinatal regionalization	NEONATAL INTENSIVE-CARE; PRINCIPAL STRATIFICATION; POST-RANDOMIZATION; IDENTIFICATION	Two problems that arise in making causal inferences for nonmortality outcomes such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are unmeasured confounding and censoring by death, ie, the outcome is observed only when subjects survive. In randomized experiments with noncompliance and no censoring by death, instrumental variable (IV) methods can be used to control for the unmeasured confounding. But, when there is censoring by death, the average causal treatment effect cannot be identified under usual assumptions but can be studied for a specific subpopulation by using sensitivity analysis with additional assumptions. However, evaluating the local average treatment effect (LATE) in observational studies with censoring by death problems while controlling for unmeasured confounding is not well studied. We develop a novel sensitivity analysis method based on IV models for studying the LATE. Specifically, we present the identification results under an additional assumption and propose a three-step procedure for the LATE estimation. Also, we propose an improved two-step procedure by simultaneously estimating the instrument propensity score (ie, the probability of instrument given covariates) and the parameters induced by the assumption. We show with simulation studies that the two-step procedure can be more robust and efficient than the three-step procedure. Finally, we apply our sensitivity analysis methods to a study on the effect of delivery at high-level neonatal intensive care units on the risk of BPD.

In case-only studies, this issue is addressed by comparing each individual with his/herself. Although case-only designs use self-matching and only include individuals who develop the outcome of interest, issues of non-exchangeability are identical to those that arise in traditional case-control and cohort studies. In this review, we describe one type of case-only design, the case-crossover design, and discuss how the concept of exchangeability can be used to understand issues of confounding, carryover effects, period effects and selection bias in case-crossover studies.

In this article, we use a linked claims and electronic health record database to comprehensively explore repurposing effects of antihypertensive drugs. We follow a target trial emulation framework for causal inference to emulate randomized controlled trials estimating confounding adjusted effects of antihypertensives on each of 262 outcomes of interest. We then fit hierarchical models to the results as a form of postprocessing to account for multiple comparisons and to sift through the results in a principled way. Our motivation is twofold. We seek both to surface genuinely intriguing drug repurposing opportunities and to elucidate through a real application some study design decisions and potential biases that arise in this context.

A set of SAS macros for calculating and displaying adjusted odds ratios (with confidence intervals) for continuous covariates in logistic B-spline regression models	COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE			English	Article						B-splines; confidence intervals; logistic regression; odds ratios; SAS macro	SERUM URIC-ACID; DOSE-RESPONSE; TREND ANALYSIS; THRESHOLD SELECTION; RISK-FACTORS; LONG-TERM; CATEGORIZATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; ALTERNATIVES; MORTALITY	In clinical and epidemiologic research to investigate dose-response associations, nonparametric spline regression has long been proposed as a powerful alternative to conventional parametric regression approaches, since no underlying assumptions of linearity have to be fulfilled. For logistic spline models, however, to date, little standard statistical software is available to estimate any measure of risk, typically of interest when quantifying the effects of one or more continuous explanatory variable(s) on a binary disease outcome. in the present paper, we propose a set of SAS macros which perform non-parametric logistic regression analysis with B-spline expansions of an arbitrary number of continuous covariates, estimating adjusted odds ratios with respective confidence intervals for any given value with respect to a supplied reference value. Our SAS codes further allow to graphically visualize the shape of the association, retaining the exposure variable under consideration in its initial, continuous form while concurrently adjusting for multiple confounding factors. The macros are easily to use and can be implemented quickly by the clinical or epidemiological researcher to flexibly investigate any dose-response association of continuous exposures with the risk of binary disease outcomes.

We present and compare different methods to calculate the treatment effect on a binary outcome as a rate ratio in a randomized surgical trial. Study Design and Setting: The effectiveness of peeling versus not peeling the internal limiting membrane of the retina as part of the surgery for a full thickness macular hole. We compared the IV-based estimates (nonparametric causal bound and two-stage residual inclusion approach [2SRI]) with standard treatment effect measures (intention to treat, per protocol and treatment received [TR)). Compliance was defined in two ways (initial and up to the time point of interest). Poisson regression was used for the model-based approaches with robust standard errors to calculate the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals. Results: Results were similar for 1-month macular hole status across methods. For 3- and 6-month macular hole status, nonparametric causal bounds provided a narrower range of uncertainty than other methods, though still had substantial imprecision. For 3-month macular hole status, the TR estimate was substantially different from the other point estimates. Conclusion: Nonparametric causal bound approaches are a useful addition to an IV estimation approach, which tend to have large levels of uncertainty. Methods which allow RRs to be calculated when addressing noncompliance in randomized trials exist and may be superior to standard estimates. Further research is needed to explore the properties of different IV methods in a broad range of randomized controlled trial scenarios. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Analyses were conducted in 2687 participants of a German, population-based cohort of older adults with data collection 2008-2010. Polypharmacy was defined as >= 5 drugs and hyperpolypharmacy as >= 10 drugs. Drugs without relevant propensity of causing adverse drug reactions or drug-drug interactions were not counted. Confounding by indication was addressed by model adjustment for a propensity score for polypharmacy. The median age of study participants was 70 years, 10.7% had multi-morbidity, and 47.4% took five drugs or more (8.6% took >= 10 drugs). During 4.4 years of follow-up, 87 participants died of a cause other than cancer. Statistically significant, more than twofold increased non-cancer mortality was observed for subjects with polypharmacy or hyperpolypharmacy in a model adjusted for age, sex, education, lifestyle variables, and comorbidity, but associations lost statistical significance after additional adjustment for a propensity score for polypharmacy. However, a significant interaction of hyperpolypharmacy and multi-morbidity was detected (p = 0.019). The hazard ratio for the association of hyperpolypharmacy with non-cancer mortality was 1.42 (95%CI 0.57; 3.57) in subjects without multi-morbidity and 0.51 (95%CI 0.11; 2.27) in subjects with multi-morbidity. Polypharmacy was not independently associated with non-cancer mortality. This study highlights the importance to adjust for confounding by indication in studies on polypharmacy by a propensity score. The detected interaction suggests that hyperpolypharmacy can be indicated in subjects with multi-morbidity and may only be harmful in subjects without multi-morbidity.

Circulating C-reactive protein (CRP) is also moderately associated with CRC risk. However, observational studies are susceptible to unmeasured confounding or reverse causality. Using genetic risk variants as instrumental variables, we investigated the causal relationship between genetically elevated CRP concentration and CRC risk, using a Mendelian randomization approach. Methods: Individual-level data from 30 480 CRC cases and 22 844 controls from 33 participating studies in three international consortia were used: the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO), the Colorectal Transdisciplinary Study (CORECT) and the Colon Cancer Family Registry (CCFR). As instrumental variables, we included 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with CRP concentration. The SNP-CRC associations were estimated using a logistic regression model adjusted for age, sex, principal components and genotyping phases. An inverse-variance weighted method was applied to estimate the causal effect of CRP on CRC risk. Results: Among the 19 CRP-associated SNPs, rs1260326 and rs6734238 were significantly associated with CRC risk (P = 7.5 x 10(-4), and P = 0.003, respectively). A genetically predicted one-unit increase in the log-transformed CRP concentrations (mg/l) was not associated with increased risk of CRC [odds ratio (OR) = 1.04; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.97, 1.12; P = 0.256). No evidence of association was observed in subgroup analyses stratified by other risk factors. Conclusions: In spite of adequate statistical power to detect moderate association, we found genetically elevated CRP concentration was not associated with increased risk of CRC among individuals of European ancestry. Our findings suggested that circulating CRP is unlikely to be a causal factor in CRC development.

J	Kim, K; Kennedy, EH; Naimi, AI				Kim, Kwangho; Kennedy, Edward H.; Naimi, Ashley, I			Incremental intervention effects in studies with dropout and many timepoints	JOURNAL OF CAUSAL INFERENCE			English	Article						causal inference; time-varying confounding; right-censoring; longitudinal study; positivity	LOW-DOSE ASPIRIN; MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; REGRESSION; TIME; OUTCOMES; DESIGN; TRIAL	Modern longitudinal studies collect feature data at many timepoints, often of the same order of sample size. Such studies are typically affected by dropout and positivity violations. We tackle these problems by generalizing effects of recent incremental interventions (which shift propensity scores rather than set treatment values deterministically) to accommodate multiple outcomes and subject dropout. We give an identifying expression for incremental intervention effects when dropout is conditionally ignorable (without requiring treatment positivity) and derive the nonparametric efficiency bound for estimating such effects. Then we present efficient nonparametric estimators, showing that they converge at fast parametric rates and yield uniform inferential guarantees, even when nuisance functions are estimated flexibly at slower rates. We also study the variance ratio of incremental intervention effects relative to more conventional deterministic effects in a novel infinite time horizon setting, where the number of timepoints can grow with sample size and show that incremental intervention effects yield near-exponential gains in statistical precision in this setup. Finally, we conclude with simulations and apply our methods in a study of the effect of low-dose aspirin on pregnancy outcomes.

When the treatments are not assigned to patients randomly, as in observational studies, we also need to account for treatment imbalances in confounding factors. In this article, we propose estimators for the difference of the restricted mean lifetime between two groups that account for treatment imbalances in prognostic factors assuming a proportional hazards relationship. Large-sample properties of our estimators based oil martingale theory for counting processes are also derived. Simulation studios were conducted to compare these estimators and to assess the adequacy of the large-sample approximations. Our methods are also applied to ail observational database of acute coronary syndrome patients from Duke University Medical Center to estimate the treatment effect oil the restricted mean lifetime over 5 years.

Biases and adjustments in nutritional assessments from dietary questionnaires	NUTRICION HOSPITALARIA			English	Article						Methods of evaluating food consumption; Evaluation of systematic nutritional errors; Biases; Random errors; Adjustments; Confounding factors; Quality; Exactness; Validity; Precision; Repetitiveness		In nutritional epidemiology, it is essential to use Food Consumption Assessment Methods that have been validated and accepted by the international community for estimating food consumption of individuals and populations. This assessment must be made with the highest quality possible so as to avoid, as far as possible, sources of error and confusion in the processes. The qualities that are required in a measurement method are validity and accuracy; validity being the main factor. Lack of validity produces biases, or systematic errors. These can reside in the process of subject selection, or processes of information gathering where the lack of accuracy produces random errors. For many nutrients, the intra-individual variances are due to many factors such as day-of-the-week or season, and could create problems in the data analyses. Adjustments are needed to minimize these effects. Confounding factors may over-or under-state the real magnitude of the observed association, or even alter the direction of the real association. Total energy intake can be a confounding variable when studying a relationship between nutrient intake and disease risk. To control for this effect several approximations are proposed such as nutrient densities, standard multivariate models and the nutrient residual model.

Longitudinal analysis of a natural experiment with dynamic objective neighbourhood measures	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Crime; Mental health; Unobserved effects models; Longitudinal study; Neighbourhood; Health selective migration; Reverse causation; Confounding	MENTAL-HEALTH; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; SCREENING SCALES; ENVIRONMENT; MOBILITY; VIOLENCE; FEAR; AGE	Identifying 'neighbourhood effects' to support widespread beliefs that where we live matters for our health remains a major challenge due to the reliance upon observational data. In this study we reassess the issue of local crime rates and psychological distress by applying unobserved ('fixed') effects models to a sample of participants who remain in the same neighbourhoods throughout the study. Baseline data was extracted from the 45 and Up Study between 2006 and 2008 and followed up as part of the Social Economic and Environmental Factors (SEEF) Study between 2009 and 2010. Kessler 10 scores were recorded for 25,545 men and 29,299 women reported valid outcomes. Annual crime rates per 1000 (including non-domestic violence, malicious damage, break and enter, and stealing, theft and robbery) from 2006 to 2010 inclusive were linked to the person-level data. Change in exposure to crime among participants in this study, therefore, occurs as a result of a change in the local crime rate, rather than a process of neighbourhood selection. Gender stratified unobserved effects logistic regression adjusting for sources of time-varying confounding (age, income, employment, couple status and physical functioning) indicated that an increase in the risk of experiencing psychological distress was generally associated with an increase in the level of neighbourhood crime. Effect sizes were particularly high for women, especially for an increase in malicious damage (Odds Ratio (Tertile 3 VS Tertile 1) 2.40, 95% Confidence Interval 1.88, 3.05), which may indicate that damage to local built environment is an important pathway linking neighbourhood crime with psychological distress. No statistically significant association was detected for an increase in non-domestic violence, although the effect was in the hypothesised direction. In summary, the application of unobserved effects models to analyse data that takes into account the temporally dynamic characteristics of where people live warrants further investigation.

However, this may be due to unmeasured confounding or selection into different types of childcare. It is not well established whether this association reflects a causal effect of childcare attendance on obesity risk. We examined the effect of attending childcare on children's BMI z scores, using nationally representative data of similar to 10700 children followed from age 9 months through kindergarten entry. METHODS: We first employed ordinary least squares regression to evaluate longitudinal associations between childcare attendance at 24 months and BMI z scores at kindergarten entry, controlling for child, family, and neighborhood characteristics. Because type of childcare is associated with unobserved confounding factors, we repeated the analysis by using 2 quasi-experimental approaches: (1) individual fixed effect models, which control for all observed and unobserved time-invariant confounders; and (2) instrumental variable (IV) analysis. RESULTS: At 24 months, 48.7% of children were in nonparental childcare, and 35.1% of children were overweight/obese at kindergarten entry. In ordinary least squares models, compared with children in parental care, children in nonparental childcare at 24 months had higher BMI z scores at kindergarten entry (0.08 [SE 0.03], P =.01). By contrast, fixed effects and IV models revealed no significant effect of childcare on BMI z score (fixed effects model: beta = 0.02 [SE 0.02], P =.62); IV model: beta = 1.12 [SE 0.76], P =.14). CONCLUSIONS: We found no consistent associations between nonparental childcare and obesity. Previously reported significant associations may be confounded by unobserved family circumstances resulting in selection into different types of childcare.

Evaluating health management programmes over time: application of propensity score-based weighting to longitudinal data	JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE			English	Article						disease management; health management; inverse probability of treatment weights; longitudinal data; propensity score	CAUSAL INFERENCE; REGRESSION; MODEL	Health management programmes are generally evaluated as point treatment studies in which only a baseline and outcome measurement are used in the analysis, even when multiple observations for each individual are available. By summarizing observations into two distinct measurements the evaluator loses any ability to discern patterns of change in the outcome variable over time in relation to the intervention. There are several statistical models available to evaluate longitudinal data that are typically regression-like in form and designed to adjust for clustering at the individual level. Most evaluators of longitudinal studies tend to adjust for the effect of time-dependent confounding by including these covariates as independent variables in the model. However, this standard adjustment approach is likely to provide biased estimates. In this paper we describe the application of the propensity score-based weighting technique to longitudinal data to estimate the effect of treatment on an outcome. This method reweights each treatment pattern to represent the entire population at each time point and provides an unbiased treatment effect. We illustrate the technique using data from a disease management programme and demonstrate its superiority over standard analytical adjustments in correcting for time-dependent confounding for each time period under study.

A large body of literature suggests that, compared with Basic Life Support (BLS) care, Advanced Life Support (ALS) care is not associated with increased patient survival or decreased mortality. The purpose of this special report is to synthesize the literature to identify common study design and analytic challenges in research studies that examine the effect of ALS, compared to BLS, on patient outcomes. The challenges discussed in this report include: (1) choice of outcome measure; (2) logistic regression modeling of common outcomes; (3) baseline differences between study groups (confounding); (4) inappropriate statistical adjustment; and (5) inclusion of patients who are no longer at risk for the outcome. These challenges may affect the results of studies, and thus, conclusions of studies regarding the effect of level of prehospital care on patient outcomes should require cautious interpretation. Specific alternatives for avoiding these challenges are presented.	[Li, Timmy; Jones, Courtney M.

Understanding logistic regression	JOURNAL FRANCAIS D OPHTALMOLOGIE			French	Article						Logistic regression; Multivariate analysis; Adjustment; Odds ratio; Confounding factor; Interaction model		Logistic regression is one of the most common multivariate analysis models utilized in epidemiology. It allows the measurement of the association between the occurrence of an event (qualitative dependent variable) and factors susceptible to influence it (explicative variables). The choice of explicative variables that should be included in the logistic regression model is based on prior knowledge of the disease physiopathology and the statistical association between the variable and the event, as measured by the odds ratio. The main steps for the procedure, the conditions of application, and the essential tools for its interpretation are discussed concisely. We also discuss the importance of the choice of variables that must be included and retained in the regression model in order to avoid the omission of important confounding factors. Finally, by way of illustration, we provide an example from the literature, which should help the reader test his or her knowledge. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

To correct for endogeneity bias, the authors propose a new method that accounts for the regressor-error dependence using flexible semiparametric odds ratio conditional models; the approach requires neither parametric distributional assumptions nor tuning parameters for modeling endogenous regressors' distributions conditional on the error term and exogenous regressors. Inference is achieved via optimizing the profile likelihood concentrating on the parameters of interest. The proposed approach requires no use of instrumental variables (IVs), observed or latent, that must satisfy the stringent condition of exclusion restriction. Nonnormally distributed endogenous regressors are required for model identification with a normal error distribution. The approach's flexibility in capturing regressor-error dependence increases the capability of IV-free endogeneity correction and provides opportunities to improve the accuracy of causal effect estimation. Unlike existing IV-free methods, the proposed approach can handle discrete endogenous regressors with few levels, such as binary regressors or count regressors with small means, and is thus applicable to a plethora of applications involving such regressors. The authors demonstrate the versatility of the approach for binary, count, and continuous endogenous regressors using comprehensive simulation studies and empirical data.

The propensity score, the probability of treatment exposure conditional on covariates, is the basis for two approaches to adjusting for confounding: methods based on stratification of observations by quantiles of estimated propensity scores and methods based on weighting observations by the inverse of estimated propensity scores. We review popular versions of these approaches and related methods offering improved precision, describe theoretical properties and highlight their implications for practice, and present extensive comparisons of performance that provide guidance for practical use.

Balancing Covariates via Propensity Score Weighting	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Balancing weights; Causal inference; Clinical equipoise; Confounding; Exact balance; Overlap weights	CAUSAL INFERENCE; MODELS; OVERLAP; CARE	Covariate balance is crucial for unconfounded descriptive or causal comparisons. However, lack of balance is common in observational studies. This article considers weighting strategies for balancing covariates. We define a general class of weightsthe balancing weightsthat balance the weighted distributions of the covariates between treatment groups. These weights incorporate the propensity score to weight each group to an analyst-selected target population. This class unifies existing weighting methods, including commonly used weights such as inverse-probability weights as special cases. General large-sample results on nonparametric estimation based on these weights are derived. We further propose a new weighting scheme, the overlap weights, in which each unit's weight is proportional to the probability of that unit being assigned to the opposite group. The overlap weights are bounded, and minimize the asymptotic variance of the weighted average treatment effect among the class of balancing weights. The overlap weights also possess a desirable small-sample exact balance property, based on which we propose a new method that achieves exact balance for means of any selected set of covariates. Two applications illustrate these methods and compare them with other approaches.

Perils and potentials of self-selected entry to epidemiological studies and surveys	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY			English	Article						External validity; Internal validity; Non-probability samples; Representativity; Transportability; Unmeasured confounders; Web-based enrolment	POSTMENOPAUSAL HORMONE-THERAPY; ILLNESS-DEATH MODEL; CLINICAL-TRIAL; EXTERNAL VALIDITY; BREAST-CANCER; PUBLIC-GOODS; RISK; DESIGN; CRITERIA; PARADOX	Low front-end cost and rapid accrual make Web-based surveys and enrolment in studies attractive, but participants are often self-selected with little reference to a well-defined study base. Of course, high quality studies must be internally valid (validity of inferences for the sample at hand), but Web-based enrolment reactivates discussion of external validity (generalization of within-study inferences to a target population or context) in epidemiology and clinical trials. Survey research relies on a representative sample produced by a sampling frame, prespecified sampling process and weighting that maps results to an intended population. In contrast, recent analytical epidemiology has shifted the focus away from survey-type representativity to internal validity in the sample. Against this background, it is a good time for statisticians to take stock of our role and position regarding surveys, observational research in epidemiology and clinical studies. The central issue is whether conditional effects in the sample (the study population) may be transported to desired target populations. Success depends on compatibility of causal structures in study and target populations, and will require subject matter considerations in each concrete case. Statisticians, epidemiologists and survey researchers should work together to increase understanding of these challenges and to develop improved tools to handle them.

J	Liu, L; Mukherjee, R; Robins, JM				Liu, Lin; Mukherjee, Rajarshi; Robins, James M.			On Nearly Assumption-Free Tests of Nominal Confidence Interval Coverage for Causal Parameters Estimated by Machine Learning	STATISTICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Causal inference; assumption-free; valid inference; U-statistics; higher-order influence functions	MODELS; INFERENCE; EFFICIENT	For many causal effect parameters of interest, doubly robust machine learning (DRML) estimators (psi) over cap (1) are the state-of-the-art, incorporating the good prediction performance of machine learning; the decreased bias of doubly robust estimators; and the analytic tractability and bias reduction of sample splitting with cross-fitting. Nonetheless, even in the absence of confounding by unmeasured factors, the nominal (1 - alpha) Wald confidence interval (psi) over cap (1) +/- z(alpha/2)(s.e) over cap[(psi) over cap (1)] may still undercover even in large samples, because the bias of (psi) over cap (1) may be of the same or even larger order than its standard error of order n(-1/2). In this paper, we introduce essentially assumption-free tests that (i) can falsify the null hypothesis that the bias of (psi) over cap (1) is of smaller order than its standard error, (ii) can provide a upper confidence bound on the true cover-age of the Wald interval, and (iii) are valid under the null under no smoothness/sparsity assumptions on the nuisance parameters. The tests, which we refer to as Assumption Free Empirical Coverage Tests (AFECTs), are based on a U-statistic that estimates part of the bias of (psi) over cap (1). Our claims need to be tempered in several important ways. First no test, including ours, of the null hypothesis that the ratio of the bias to its standard error is smaller than some threshold delta can be consistent [without additional assumptions (e.g., smoothness or sparsity) that may be incorrect]. Second, the above claims only apply to certain parameters in a particular class. For most of the others, our results are unavoidably less sharp. In particular, for these parameters, we cannot directly test whether the nominal Wald interval (psi) over cap (1) +/- z(alpha/2)(s.e) over cap[(psi) over cap (1)] undercovers. However, we can often test the validity of the smoothness and/or sparsity assumptions used by an analyst to justify a claim that the reported Wald interval's actual coverage is no less than nominal. Third, in the main text, with the exception of the simulation study in Sec- tion 1, we assume we are in the semisupervised data setting (wherein there is a much larger dataset with information only on the covariates), allowing us to regard the covariance matrix of the covariates as known. In the simulation in Section 1, we consider the setting in which estimation of the covariance ma- trix is required. In the simulation, we used a data adaptive estimator which performs very well in our simulations, but the estimator's theoretical sampling behavior remains unknown.

Methods to assess seasonal effects in epidemiological studies of infectious diseasesuexemplified by application to the occurrence of meningococcal disease	CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTION			English	Review						communicable diseases; confounding factors; infectious disease medicine; meningococcal infections; seasons; statistics; time	TIME-SERIES; DIAGNOSIS; DANISH; ASSOCIATION; CHILDHOOD; REGISTER; HEALTH; TRENDS; BIRTH; RISK	Clin Microbiol Infect 2012; 18: 963969 Abstract Seasonal variation in occurrence is a common feature of many diseases, especially those of infectious origin. Studies of seasonal variation contribute to healthcare planning and to the understanding of the aetiology of infections. In this article, we provide an overview of statistical methods for the assessment and quantification of seasonality of infectious diseases, as exemplified by their application to meningococcal disease in Denmark in 19952011. Additionally, we discuss the conditions under which seasonality should be considered as a covariate in studies of infectious diseases. The methods considered range from the simplest comparison of disease occurrence between the extremes of summer and winter, through modelling of the intensity of seasonal patterns by use of a sine curve, to more advanced generalized linear models. All three classes of method have advantages and disadvantages. The choice among analytical approaches should ideally reflect the research question of interest. Simple methods are compelling, but may overlook important seasonal peaks that would have been identified if more advanced methods had been applied. For most studies, we suggest the use of methods that allow estimation of the magnitude and timing of seasonal peaks and valleys, ideally with a measure of the intensity of seasonality, such as the peak-to-low ratio. Seasonality may be a confounder in studies of infectious disease occurrence when it fulfils the three primary criteria for being a confounder, i.e. when both the disease occurrence and the exposure vary seasonally without seasonality being a step in the causal pathway. In these situations, confounding by seasonality should be controlled as for any confounder.	[Christiansen, C. F.; Pedersen, L.; Sorensen, H.

Approaches aim to generate a priori hypotheses of the mechanism of action of a complex intervention to identify the key variables that might contribute to variation among studies and guide statistical analysis. In addition to characteristics related to the population, intervention, and outcomes, we describe study-related variables, such as the way the interventions have been implemented and the context and conduct of studies. These approaches will guide reviewers planning a meta-analysis and provide a rationale for not meta-analyzing data if there is too much variability. Potential difficulties in applying meta-analytical techniques to examine statistical association among study results and sources of potential heterogeneity are described; these include the selection of a fixed or random-effects model, the risk of multiple testing and confounding when studies include different aspects of a complex intervention or different subsamples of the intended participant pool.

To derive the criterion for a factor to be a confounder given by Miettinen and Cook and to clarify inconsistency between various criteria for a confounder, we introduce the concepts of an irrelevant factor, an occasional confounder and a uniformly irrelevant factor. We discuss criteria for checking these and show that Miettinen and Cook's criterion can also be applied to occasional confounders. Moreover, we consider situations with multiple potential confounders, and we obtain two necessary conditions that are satisfied by each confounder set. None of the definitions and results presented in this paper require the ignorability and sufficient control confounding assumptions which are commonly employed in observational and epidemiological studies.

J	Kalantar-Zadeh, K				Kalantar-Zadeh, Kamyar			What is so bad about reverse epidemiology anyway?	SEMINARS IN DIALYSIS			English	Review							BODY-MASS INDEX; CARDIOVASCULAR RISK-FACTORS; C-REACTIVE PROTEIN; OBESITY PARADOX; DIALYSIS PATIENTS; HEART-FAILURE; HEMODIALYSIS-PATIENTS; CHOLESTEROL LEVEL; BLOOD-PRESSURE; PREDICT MORTALITY	The term "reverse epidemiology" is used to indicate that such surrogates of cardiovascular risk and metabolic syndrome as obesity, hypercholesterolemia and hypertension are paradoxically associated with greater survival in individuals with chronic disease states and wasting, including dialysis patients, in whom the short-term survival is the issue at hand. It is being debated whether the crossing curves of the obesity-mortality association in dialysis patients vs. the general population reflect the residual confounding that needs to be controlled away statistically, or whether they have biological plausibility in sharp contradistinction to the currently dominating Framingham paradigm. In the rush to define the crossing curves as statistical artifact and to dismiss the term "reverse epidemiology" as a misnomer, we may miss the opportunity to gain information housed in those crossing lines and may miss the bigger picture, i.e., how to improve longevity in dialysis patients. Even though some of the survival paradoxes in dialysis patients appear to fulfill the Hill's criteria of causation, there are still two major drawbacks: (1) convincing pathophysiologic pathways to link dialysis patient survival to obesity, fat accumulation, higher serum lipoprotein levels or slightly higher than normal blood pressure values are yet to be verified in animal and other scientifically sound models; and (2) randomized controlled trials need to show that nutritional interventions resulting in weight gain can lead to greater survival in dialysis patients. Studying the survival paradoxes may lead to a paradigm shift by establishing targets beyond the Framingham guidelines for populations with chronic disease states.

Usually, such outcomes are recorded as multiple variables with different distributions. Mendelian randomization (MR) is a commonly used technique for causal inference with the help of genetic instrumental variables to deal with observed and unobserved confounders. Nevertheless, the current methodology of MR for multiple outcomes only focuses on one outcome at a time, meaning that it does not consider the correlation structure of multiple outcomes, which may lead to a loss of statistical power. In situations with multiple outcomes of interest, especially when there are mixed correlated outcomes with different distributions, it is much more desirable to jointly analyze them with a multivariate approach. Some multivariate methods have been proposed to model mixed outcomes; however, they do not incorporate instrumental variables and cannot handle unmeasured confounders. To overcome the above challenges, we propose a two-stage multivariate Mendelian randomization method (MRMO) that can perform multivariate analysis of mixed outcomes using genetic instrumental variables. We demonstrate that our proposed MRMO algorithm can gain power over the existing univariate MR method through simulation studies and a clinical application on a randomized Phase III clinical trial study on colorectal cancer patients.

We propose a hybrid ecologic-epidemiologic design called the trend-in- trend design, which requires a strong time trend in exposure, but is unbiased unless there are unmeasured factors affecting outcome for which there are time trends in prevalence that are correlated with time trends in exposure across strata with different exposure trends. Thus, the conditions under which the trend-in-trend study is biased are a subset of those under which a cohort study is biased. The trend-in- trend design first divides the study population into strata based on the cumulative probability of exposure given covariates, which effectively stratifies on time trend in exposure, provided there is a trend. Next, a covariates-free maximum likelihood model estimates the odds ratio (OR) using data on exposure prevalence and outcome frequency within cumulative probability of exposure strata, across multiple periods. In simulations, the trend-in-trend design produced ORs with negligible bias in the presence of unmeasured confounding. In empiric applications, trend-in-trend reproduced the known positive association between rofecoxib and myocardial infarction (observed OR: 1.2, 95% confidence interval: 1.1, 1.4), and known null associations between rofecoxib and severe hypoglycemia (OR = 1.1 [0.92, 1.3]) and nonvertebral fracture (OR = 0.84 [0.64, 1.1]). The trend-in-trend method may be useful in settings where there is a strong time trend in exposure, such as a newly approved drug or other medical intervention.

J	Lee, PH				Lee, Paul H.			Is a Cutoff of 10% Appropriate for the Change-in-Estimate Criterion of Confounder Identification?	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						causality; confounding factors; regression; simulation; statistical models	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; SELECTION; HEALTH; DISEASE	Background: When using the change-in-estimate criterion, a cutoff of 10% is commonly used to identify confounders. However, the appropriateness of this cutoff has never been evaluated. This study investigated cutoffs required under different conditions. Methods: Four simulations were performed to select cutoffs that achieved a significance level of 5% and a power of 80%, using linear regression and logistic regression. A total of 10 000 simulations were run to obtain the percentage differences of the 4 fitted regression coefficients (with and without adjustment). Results: In linear regression, larger effect size, larger sample size, and lower standard deviation of the error term led to a lower cutoff point at a 5% significance level. In contrast, larger effect size and a lower exposure-confounder correlation led to a lower cutoff point at 80% power. In logistic regression, a lower odds ratio and larger sample size led to a lower cutoff point at a 5% significance level, while a lower odds ratio, larger sample size, and lower exposure-confounder correlation yielded a lower cutoff point at 80% power. Conclusions: Cutoff points for the change-in-estimate criterion varied according to the effect size of the exposure-outcome relationship, sample size, standard deviation of the regression error, and exposure-confounder correlation.

Unfortunately, recovery after fall-related trauma such as hip fracture is poor, where older adults diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) spend a particularly long time in hospitals or rehabilitation facilities during the post-operative recuperation period. Because older adults value functional recovery and spending time at home versus facilities as key outcomes after hospitalization, identifying factors that influence days spent at home after hospitalization is imperative. While several individual-level factors have been identified, the characteristics of the treating hospital have recently been identified as contributors. However, few methodological rigorous approaches are available to help overcome potential sources of bias such as hospital-level unmeasured confounders, informative hospital size, and loss to follow-up due to death. This article develops a useful tool equipped with unsupervised learning to simultaneously handle statistical complexities that are often encountered in health services research, especially when using large administrative claims databases. The proposed estimator has a closed form, thus only requiring light computation load in a large-scale study. We further develop its asymptotic properties with stabilized inference assisted by unsupervised clustering.

Standard survival methods that incorporate time-varying confounders as covariates generally yield biased effect estimates. Estimators using weighting by inverse probability of exposure can be unstable when confounders are highly predictive of exposure or the exposure is continuous. Structural nested accelerated failure time models (AFTMs) require artificial recensoring, which can cause estimation difficulties. Here, we introduce the structural nested cumulative survival time model (SNCSTM). This model assumes that intervening to set exposure at time t to zero has an additive effect on the subsequent conditional hazard given exposure and confounder histories when all subsequent exposures have already been set to zero. We show how to fit it using standard software for generalized linear models and describe two more efficient, double robust, closed-form estimators. All three estimators avoid the artificial recensoring of AFTMs and the instability of estimators that use weighting by the inverse probability of exposure. We examine the performance of our estimators using a simulation study and illustrate their use on data from the UK Cystic Fibrosis Registry. The SNCSTM is compared with a recently proposed structural nested cumulative failure time model, and several advantages of the former are identified.

They are more widely used than structural nested models, partly because these models are easier to understand and to implement. We extend marginal structural models to situations with clustered observations with unit- and cluster-level treatment and introduce an appropriate inferential method. We consider how to formulate models with cluster-level and unit-level treatments. For unit-level treatments, we consider cases with and without interference. We also consider the use of unit-specific inverse probability weights and certain working correlation structures to improve the efficiency of estimators in some situations. We apply our method to different scenarios including 2 or 3 units per cluster and a mixture of larger clusters. Simulation examples and data from the treatment arm of a glaucoma clinical trial were used to illustrate our method.

Methods: We reviewed the statistical, economical and medical literature on the development, comparison and use of methods adjusting for confounding, Results: In addition to standard statistical techniques of (logistic) regression and Cox proportional hazards regression. alternative methods have been proposed to adjust for confounding in observational studies. A first group of methods focus on the main problem of nonrandomization by balancing treatment groups on observed covariates: selection, matching, stratification, multivariate confounder score. and propensity score methods of which the latter can be combined with stratification or various matching methods. Another group of methods look for variables to be used like randomization in order to adjust also for unobserved covariates: instrumental variable methods. two-stage least squares, and grouped-treatment approach. Identifying these variables is difficult. however. and assumptions are strong. Sensitivity analyses are useful tools in assessing the robustness and plausibility of the estimated treatment effects to variations in assumptions about unmeasured confounders. Conclusion: In most studies regression-like techniques are routinely used for adjustment for confounding. although alternative methods are available. More complete empirical evaluations comparing these methods in different situations are needed. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Current approaches used in epidemiologic studies to examine short-term multipollutant air pollution exposures	ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Review						Air pollution health effects; Joint effects; Multipollutant; Dimension reduction; Nonparametric methods; Interactions; Differential effects	PM SOURCE APPORTIONMENT; DAILY MORTALITY; VARIABLE SELECTION; REGRESSION TREES; HEALTH; POLLUTANTS; ASSOCIATIONS; MODELS; CLASSIFICATION; PARTICULATE	Purpose: Air pollution epidemiology traditionally focuses on the relationship between individual air pollutants and health outcomes (e.g., mortality). To account for potential copollutant confounding, individual pollutant associations are often estimated by adjusting or controlling for other pollutants in the mixture. Recently, the need to characterize the relationship between health outcomes and the larger multipollutant mixture has been emphasized in an attempt to better protect public health and inform more sustainable air quality management decisions. Methods: New and innovative statistical methods to examine multipollutant exposures were identified through a broad literature search, with a specific focus on those statistical approaches currently used in epidemiologic studies of short-term exposures to criteria air pollutants (i.e., particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone). Results: Five broad classes of statistical approaches were identified for examining associations between short-term multipollutant exposures and health outcomes, specifically additive main effects, effect measure modification, unsupervised dimension reduction, supervised dimension reduction, and nonparametric methods. These approaches are characterized including advantages and limitations in different epidemiologic scenarios. Discussion: By highlighting the characteristics of various studies in which multipollutant statistical methods have been used, this review provides epidemiologists and biostatisticians with a resource to aid in the selection of the most optimal statistical method to use when examining multipollutant exposures.

J	Steenland, K; Greenland, S				Steenland, K; Greenland, S			Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis and Bayesian analysis of smoking as an unmeasured confounder in a study of silica and lung cancer	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Bayes theorem; confounding factors (epidemiology); epidemiologic methods; lung neoplasms; Monte Carlo method; occupational exposure; occupations; smoking	BIAS; UNCERTAINTY; IMPACT	Conventional confidence intervals reflect uncertainty due to random error but omit uncertainty due to biases, such as confounding, selection bias, and measurement error. Such uncertainty can be quantified, especially if the investigator has some idea of the amount of such bias. A traditional sensitivity analysis produces one or more point estimates for the exposure effect hypothetically adjusted for bias, but it does not provide a range of effect measures given the likely range of bias. Here the authors used Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis and Bayesian bias analysis to provide such a range, using data from a US silica-lung cancer study in which results were potentially confounded by smoking. After positing a distribution for the smoking habits of workers and referents, a distribution of rate ratios for the effect of smoking on lung cancer, and a model for the bias parameter, the authors derived a distribution for the silica-lung cancer rate ratios hypothetically adjusted for smoking. The original standardized mortality ratio for the silica-lung cancer relation was 1.60 (95% confidence interval: 1.31, 1.93). Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis, adjusting for possible confounding by smoking, led to an adjusted standardized mortality ratio of 1.43 (95% Monte Carlo limits: 1.15, 1.78). Bayesian results were similar (95% posterior limits: 1.13, 1.84). The authors believe that these types of analyses, which make explicit and quantify sources of uncertainty, should be more widely adopted by epidemiologists.

However, estimating treatment effects using EHR data poses several challenges, including time-varying confounding, repeated and temporally non-aligned measurements of covariates, treatment assignments and outcomes, and loss-to-follow-up due to dropout. Here, we develop the subgroup discovery for longitudinal data algorithm, a tree-based algorithm for discovering subgroups with heterogeneous treatment effects using longitudinal data by combining the generalized interaction tree algorithm, a general data-driven method for subgroup discovery, with longitudinal targeted maximum likelihood estimation. We apply the algorithm to EHR data to discover subgroups of people living with human immunodeficiency virus who are at higher risk of weight gain when receiving dolutegravir (DTG)-containing antiretroviral therapies (ARTs) versus when receiving non-DTG-containing ARTs.

The possible causal impact of dialysis dose on mortality needs to be investigated using rich cohort data analyzed with novel statistical methods such as marginal structural models (MSMs) that account for time-varying confounding and exposure. Methods: We quantified the effect of delivered dose of hemodialysis (HD) [single-pool Kt/V (spKt/V)] on mortality risk in a contemporary cohort of 68,110 patients undergoing HD 3 times weekly (7/2001-9/2005). We compared conventional Cox proportional hazard and MSM survival analyses, accounting for time-varying confounding by applying Iongitudinally modeled inverse-probability-of-dialysis-dose weights to each observation. Results: In conventional Cox models, baseline spKt/V showed a weak negative association with mortality, while higher time-averaged spKt/V was strongly associated with lower mortality risk. In MSM analyses, compared to a spKt/V range of 1.2-<1.4, a spKt/V range of <1.2 was associated with a higher risk of mortality [HR (95% CI) 1.67 (1.54-1.80)], whereas mortality risks were significantly lower with higher spKt/V [HRs (95% CI): 0.74 (0.70-0.78), 0.63 (0.59-0.66), 0.56 (0.52-0.60), and 0.56(0.52-0.61) for spKt/V ranges of 1.4-<1.6, 1.6-<1.8, 1.8-<2.0, and >= 2.0, respectively]. Thus, MSM analyses showed that the greatest survival advantage of a higher dialysis dose was observed for a spKt/V range of 1.8-<2.0, and the dialysis dose-mortality relationship was robust in almost all subgroups of patients. Conclusions: Higher HD doses were robustly associated with greater survival in MSM analyses that more fully and appropriately accounted for time-varying confounding. (C) 2014 S.

In this paper, we aimed (i) to assess predictors of retention in a cohort study (the SUN Project) where participants are followed-up through biennial mailed questionnaires, and (ii) to evaluate whether differential follow-up introduced selection bias in rate ratio (RR) estimates. The SUN Study recruited 9907 participants from December 1999 to January 2002. Among them, 8647 (87%) participants answered the 2-year follow-up questionnaire. The presence of missing information in key variables at baseline, being younger, smoker, a marital status different of married, being obese/overweight and a history of motor vehicle injury were associated with being lost to follow-up, while a self-reported history of cardiovascular disease predicted a higher retention proportion. To assess whether differential follow-up affected RR estimates, we studied the association between body mass index and the risk of hypertension, using inverse probability weighting (IPW) to adjust for confounding and selection bias. Obese individuals had a higher crude rate of hypertension compared with normoweight participants (RR = 6.4, 95% confidence interval (Cl): 3.9-10.5). Adjustment for confounding using IPW attenuated the risk of hypertension associated to obesity (RR = 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1-5.3). Additional adjustment for selection bias did not modify the estimations. In conclusion, we show that the follow-up through mailed questionnaires of a geographically disperse cohort in Spain is possible. Furthermore, we show that despite existing differences between retained or lost to follow-up participants this may not necessarily have an important impact on the RR estimates of hypertension associated to obesity.

Sex differences in the impact of acute stroke treatment in a population-based study: a sex-specific propensity score approach	ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Stroke; Sex factors; Therapeutics	TISSUE-PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATOR; ACUTE ISCHEMIC-STROKE; BRAIN ATTACK SURVEILLANCE; CHRISTI BASIC PROJECT; VARIABLE SELECTION; URIC-ACID; TRIAL; SCALE	Purpose: We investigated whether sex modifies the association of acute stroke treatment on functional outcome using propensity score (PS) methods to minimize confounding and to explore the differential effects of confounders by sex. Methods: We included tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treated (n = 84) and nontreated ischemic stroke cases (n = 143) from a population-based stroke study (2008-2013). The PS model that estimated the probability of receiving tPA included interactions between sex and treatment predictors. The outcome model included sex, tPA, and their interaction. In addition, sex-specific PS values were included as a continuous covariate and modeled using splines. We compared the results with conventional methods of statistical adjustment. Results: Conventional methods of adjustment suggested that women receive greater benefit from tPA than men. After taking into consideration that the influence of confounders, specifically age and stroke severity, differed by sex, we found no sex difference in the tPA-functional outcome association (P =.94). Conclusions: Using PS methods that considered confounding of the sex x treatment interaction, we did not find that the association of tPA with functional outcome differed for women and men. Our findings may have implications for the methodologic approaches used to address confounding in studies that seek to compare stroke treatment effects by sex. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The relationship between aldosterone, all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality in observational studies performed so far is controversial. Design We investigated the relationship between aldosterone, mortality and CV events in multivariate analyses including nutrition status, inflammation, LV function and fluids volume biomarkers in 278 ESRD patients without heart failure at baseline. Results In univariate analyses aldosterone was an inverse predictor of death (3rd tertile vs. 1st tertile Hazard ratios (HR): 0.58; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38-0.90. P = 0.01) and CV events (HR: 0.63; 95% CI 0.41-0.96; P = 0.03). Data adjustment for inflammation and malnutrition biomarkers substantially reduced the inverse relationship between aldosterone, mortality and CV events to be largely not significant (P = 0.31 and P = 0.36, respectively). The same was true by adjusting for volume expansion and LV dysfunction (left atrial volume and atrial natriuretic peptide) biomarkers (P = 0.30 for both outcomes). In a model adjusting for the full set of biomarkers of protein energy wasting/inflammation and volume expansion/LV dysfunction the inverse relationship between aldosterone and death and CV events was nullified (HR for death 0.98, P = 0.93; HR for CV events 0.96, P = 0.87). Conclusions Aldosterone is an inverse predictor of mortality and CV events in ESRD patients. This seemingly paradoxical relationship is abolished by statistical adjustment for inflammation, protein energy malnutrition, and volume expansion biomarkers indicating that it is the mere expression of the confounding effect of these factors. A clinical trial is needed to establish if aldosterone antagonism may improve clinical outcomes in ESRD.

STATISTICAL INFERENCE IN TWO-SAMPLE SUMMARY-DATA MENDELIAN RANDOMIZATION USING ROBUST ADJUSTED PROFILE SCORE	ANNALS OF STATISTICS			English	Article						Causal inference; limited information maximum likelihood; weak instruments; errors in variables; path analysis; pleiotropy effects	INVALID INSTRUMENTS; COMPLEX TRAITS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; GENETIC-VARIANTS; ASSOCIATION; PLEIOTROPY; VARIABLES; IDENTIFICATION; DESIGN	Mendelian randomization (MR) is a method of exploiting genetic variation to unbiasedly estimate a causal effect in presence of unmeasured confounding. MR is being widely used in epidemiology and other related areas of population science. In this paper, we study statistical inference in the increasingly popular two-sample summary-data MR design. We show a linear model for the observed associations approximately holds in a wide variety of settings when all the genetic variants satisfy the exclusion restriction assumption, or in genetic terms, when there is no pleiotropy. In this scenario, we derive a maximum profile likelihood estimator with provable consistency and asymptotic normality. However, through analyzing real datasets, we find strong evidence of both systematic and idiosyncratic pleiotropy in MR, echoing the omnigenic model of complex traits that is recently proposed in genetics. We model the systematic pleiotropy by a random effects model, where no genetic variant satisfies the exclusion restriction condition exactly. In this case, we propose a consistent and asymptotically normal estimator by adjusting the profile score. We then tackle the idiosyncratic pleiotropy by robustifying the adjusted profile score. We demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of the proposed methods using several simulated and real datasets.

Economic evaluation of health benefits of lead reduction usually assumes a linear dose-response function, regardless of the outcome measure used. We reanalyzed a previously published study, an international pooled data set combining data from seven prospective lead studies examining contemporaneous blood lead effect on IQ (intelligence quotient) of 7-year-old children (n = 1,333). We constructed alternative linear multiple regression models with linear blood lead terms (linear-linear dose response) and natural-log-transformed blood lead terms (log-linear dose response). We tested the two lead specifications for nonlinearity in the models, compared the two lead specifications for significantly better fit to the data, and examined the effects of possible residual confounding on the functional form of the dose-response relationship. We found that a log-linear lead-IQ relationship was a significantly better fit than was a linear-linear relationship for IQ (p = 0.009), with little evidence of residual confounding of included model variables. We substituted the log-linear lead-IQ effect in a previously published health benefits model and found that the economic savings due to U.S. population lead decrease between 1976 and 1999 (from 17.1 mu g/dL to 2.0 mu g/dL) was 2.2 times ($319 billion) that calculated using a linear-linear dose-response function ($149 billion). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention action limit of 10 mu g/dL for children fails to protect against most damage and economic cost attributable to lead exposure.

Study Design and Setting: In each example, we constructed a concurrent cohort of new and old drug initiators using US claims databases. In historical cohorts of old drug initiators, we developed hdDRS models including investigator-specified plus empirically identified variables and using principal component analysis and lasso regression for dimension reduction. We applied the models to the concurrent cohorts to obtain predicted outcome probabilities, which we used for confounding adjustment. We compared the resulting estimates to those from hdPS. Results: The crude odds ratio (OR) comparing dabigatran to warfarin was 0.52 (95% confidence interval: 0.37-0.72) for hemorrhage and 0.38 (0.26-0.55) for death. Decile stratification yielded an OR of 0.64 (0.46-0.90) for hemorrhage using hdDRS vs. 0.70 (0.49-1.02) for hdPS. ORs for death were 0.69 (0.45-1.06) and 0.73 (0.48-1.10), respectively. The relative performance of hdDRS in the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors example was similar. Conclusion: hdDRS achieved similar or better confounding adjustment compared to conventional regression approach but worked slightly less well than hdPS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Joint Estimation of Treatment and Placebo Effects in Clinical Trials With Longitudinal Blinding Assessments	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Causal inference; Confounding; Double robustness; G-computation; Inverse probability weighting; Sequential regression; Targeted minimum loss based estimation; Treatmentality	CAUSAL INFERENCE; DISULFIRAM; MODEL	In some therapeutic areas, treatment evaluation is frequently complicated by a possible placebo effect (i.e., the psychobiological effect of a patient's knowledge or belief of being treated). When a substantial placebo effect is likely to exist, it is important to distinguish the treatment and placebo effects in quantifying the clinical benefit of a new treatment. These causal effects can be formally defined in a joint causal model that includes treatment (e.g., new vs. placebo) and treatmentality (i.e., a patient's belief or mentality about which treatment she or he has received) as separate exposures. Information about the treatmentality exposure can be obtained from blinding assessments, which are increasingly common in clinical trials where blinding success is in question. Assuming that treatmentality has a lagged effect and is measured at multiple time points, this article is concerned with joint evaluation of treatment and placebo effects in clinical trials with longitudinal follow-up, possibly with monotone missing data. We describe and discuss several methods adapted from the longitudinal causal inference literature, apply them to a weight loss study, and compare them in simulation experiments that mimic the weight loss study.

Marginal structural models were employed to address time-varying exposure, confounding, and possibly informative censoring in an administrative data set of adult patients who were hospitalized with acute coronary syndrome and treated with either clopidogrel or ticagrelor. The effectiveness endpoint included first occurrence of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. These methodologies were then applied across simulated data sets with varying frequencies of treatment switching and censoring to compare the effect estimate of each analysis. The findings suggest that implementing different analytical approaches has an impact on the point estimate and interpretation of analyses, especially when censoring is highly unbalanced.

Impact of waiting time on post-transplant survival for recipients with hepatocellular carcinoma: A natural experiment randomized by blood group	JHEP REPORTS			English	Article						Hepatocellular carcinoma; Liver transplantation; Waiting time; Instru-mental variable analysis; Mendelian randomization; Causal inference; Quasi ran-domized controlled trial	LIVER-TRANSPLANTATION; RECURRENCE; LIST	Background & Aims: When listing for liver transplantation, one can transplant as soon as possible or introduce a test-of-time to better select patients, as the tumor's biological behavior is observed. Knowing the degree of harm caused by time itself is essential to advise patients and decide on the maximum duration of the test-of-time. Therefore, we investigated the causal effect of waiting time on post-transplant survival for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: We analyzed the UNOS-OPTN dataset and exploited a natural experiment created by blood groups. Relations be-tween variables and assumptions were described in a causal graph. Selection bias was addressed by inverse probability weighting. Confounding was avoided using instrumental variable analysis, with an additive hazards model in the second stage. The causal effect was evaluated by estimating the difference in 5-year overall survival if all patients waited 2 months instead of 12 months. Upper bounds of the test-of-time were evaluated for probable scenarios by means of simulation.Results: The F-statistic of the first stage was 86.3. The effect of waiting 12 months vs. 2 months corresponded with a drop in overall survival rate of 5.07% (95% CI 0.277-9.69) and 8.33% (95% CI 0.47-15.60) at 5-and 10-years post-transplant, respec-tively. The median survival dropped by 3.41 years from 16.21 years (95% CI 15.98-16.60) for those waiting 2 months to 12.80 years (95% CI 10.72-15.90) for those waiting 12 months.Conclusions: From a patient's perspective, the choice between ablate-and-wait vs. immediate transplantation is in favor of immediate transplantation. From a policy perspective, the extra waiting time can be used to increase the utility of scarce donor livers. However, the duration of the test-of-time is bounded, and it likely should not exceed 8 months.Impact and implications: When listing patients with liver cancer for transplantation, it is unclear whether a test-of-time or immediate transplantation offer better outcomes at the population level. In this study, we found that increased liver trans-plant waiting times are detrimental in patients with liver cancer. Furthermore, our simulation showed that a pre-operative observational period can be useful to ensure good donor liver allocation, but that its duration should not exceed 8 months.

Tenuous dose-response correlations for common disease states: case study of cholesterol and perfluorooctanoate/sulfonate (PFOA/PFOS) in the C8 Health Project	DRUG AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY			English	Review						perfluoroalkyl; epidemiology; obesity; body mass index; causation; confounding; selection bias	HUMAN SERUM-ALBUMIN; AMMONIUM PERFLUOROOCTANOATE; PERFLUOROALKYL ACIDS; PFOA CONCENTRATIONS; CYNOMOLGUS MONKEYS; LIVER-ENZYMES; EXPOSURE; SULFONATE; TOXICITY; WORKERS	Persistent organic chemicals, such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), dioxins, and polychlorinated biphenyls, pose investigative challenges because they are found in virtually everyone (there is no unexposed control group). To overcome this problem, outcome data in some studies are sorted by chemical dose level and findings in low-end dose groups are compared to sequential higher dose groups. An example is the C8 Health Project that evaluated serum PFOA/PFOS (C8) and total cholesterol among 46,294 West Virginia residents who lived, worked, or went to school for at least 1 year in a C8 contaminated drinking-water district and were over age 18 in 2005-2006. The risk for high total cholesterol (>240 mg/dL) measured via odds ratios (ORs) in logistic regression models showed sequential OR increases with PFOA quartile, in comparison to the lowest quartile (OR = 1.00), that were each significantly elevated (OR = 1.21, 1.33, and 1.40, respectively), but age, sex, and body mass index were stronger correlates. Importantly, the magnitude of cholesterol increase was small (12 mg/dL from lowest to highest exposure deciles) and comparison to similar statistics for the general U. S. population showed the C8 cohort had lower rates of high cholesterol. This suggests that inadvertent selection bias may have affected the lowest exposure quartile (control group), making tenuous the dose-response relationship between PFOA/PFOS and risk of high cholesterol. This case illustrates the substantial difficulties in assigning toxicological importance to statistical comparisons for common disease states that utilize subgroups with low exposures as an effective control group.

For example, in a study of the risk of endometrial cancer in relation to the duration and the recency of use of estrogen replacement therapy (ERT), simultaneously including terms for duration and recency of exposure to ERT in a logistic model may leave the mistaken impression that it is possible to adjust for recency when a given duration of ERT use is compared with no use. In this article, the authors show why such an adjusted comparison is impossible, and they discuss several pitfalls in the interpretation of logistic regression coefficients when two or more characteristics of exposure are under study. They also suggest a method for avoiding these pitfalls.

On Bayesian Estimation of Marginal Structural Models	BIOMETRICS			English	Article						Bayesian inference; Causal inference; Inverse probability weighting; Longitudinal data; Marginal structural models; Posterior predictive inference; Variance estimation	PROPENSITY SCORE; INFERENCE	The purpose of inverse probability of treatment (IPT) weighting in estimation of marginal treatment effects is to construct a pseudo-population without imbalances in measured covariates, thus removing the effects of confounding and informative censoring when performing inference. In this article, we formalize the notion of such a pseudo-population as a data generating mechanism with particular characteristics, and show that this leads to a natural Bayesian interpretation of IPT weighted estimation. Using this interpretation, we are able to propose the first fully Bayesian procedure for estimating parameters of marginal structural models using an IPT weighting. Our approach suggests that the weights should be derived from the posterior predictive treatment assignment and censoring probabilities, answering the question of whether and how the uncertainty in the estimation of the weights should be incorporated in Bayesian inference of marginal treatment effects. The proposed approach is compared to existing methods in simulated data, and applied to an analysis of the Canadian Co-infection Cohort.

Methods: We applied logistic marginal structural models to explore causal relationships between leisure time physical activity and a measure of relative muscle mass (the lean:fat mass ratio) and self-reported functional limitation. Subjects (n = 1655) were members of a population-based cohort recruited in Sonoma, California, in 1993-1994 (median age 70 years); they were surveyed 3 times over 6.5 years. Results: Based on the marginal structural model, the causal odds ratio for functional limitation with a 0.5-unit increment in relative muscle mass was 0.56 in women (95% Cl = 0.46-0.67). This reduction in odds was not altered by adjustment for baseline covariates. The corresponding causal odds ratio in men was 0.77 (0.65-0.92). This also was not influenced by baseline covariates or levels of physical activity. There was evidence for an independent causal effect of increased levels of physical activity on reduction of odds of functional limitation for men but not for women. Obese women experienced no protective effect of increased lean-to-fat mass. Normal-weight women experienced a benefit with increasing levels of physical activity. Conclusions: Marginal structural models provide a means to address time-dependent confounding, which can occur in longitudinal studies. These analyses indicate that leisure time physical activity exerts its beneficial effects through reductions in fat mass relative to lean body mass.

J	Bagheri, O; Moeltner, K; Yang, W				Bagheri, Omid; Moeltner, Klaus; Yang, Wei			Respiratory illness, hospital visits, and health costs: Is it air pollution or pollen?	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Air pollution; Hospital visits; Allergies; Respiratory health; Count data models	AIRBORNE POLLEN; PARTICULATE MATTER; ALLERGIC RHINITIS; ASTHMA; IMPACT; ADMISSIONS; SYMPTOMS; MORTALITY; EXPOSURE; WILDFIRE	Background: Both air pollution and airborne pollen can cause respiratory health problems. Since both are often jointly present in ambient air, it is important to control for one while estimating the effect of the other when considering pollution-abating policies. To date only a limited number of studies have considered the health effects of both irritants jointly for a general population, and for a sufficiently long time period to allow for variation in seasonal concentrations of both components. The primary goal of this study is to determine the causal impact of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on hospital visits and related treatment costs, while controlling for potentially confounding pollen effects. Our study area is the metropolitan hub of Reno/Sparks in Northern Nevada. Methods: Taking advantage of a rare sample of daily pollen counts over a prolonged period of time (2009-2015), we model the effects of PM2.5 and pollen on respiratory-related hospital admissions for the population at large, plus specific age groups. Pollen data are provided by a local allergy clinic. Data on PM2.5 and other air pollutants are obtained from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's air quality data web site. We collect daily meteorological data from the National Centers for Environmental Information's data repository. Data on hospital admissions are given by the Nevada Center for Surveys, Evaluations, and Statistics. Our econometric approach centers on a fully robust count data (Poisson) model, estimated via Quasi-Maximum Likelihood. Results: We find that for our sample PM2.5 effects are largely robust to the inclusion of both pollen counts and temporal indicators. In contrast, pollen effects vanish when time fixed effects are added, pointing at their correlation with unobserved temporal confounders. At the same time, model fit improves with the inclusion of temporal indicators. Based on our preferred specification, we find a significant effect of approximately 0.5% additional hospital visits per day due to a one mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 This translates into expected augmented treatment costs of $2700 per day for the same unit-change in PM2.5. These figures can mount quickly when more pronounced and/or longer episodes of particulate matter pollution are considered, perhaps due to wildfire smoke. For instance, the expected increase in patients and costs due to a month-long 10-unit-jump of PM2.5 over the long-run annual average would amount to an extra 70 patients and approximately $680,000 in additional treatment costs.

Recent Findings Bone is a dynamic tissue, responsive to mechanical loading and unloading, being these adaptative responses more intense during the growth and development period. Cross-sectional studies usually report a lower bone mass in swimmers compared to athletes engaged in weigh-bearing sports. However, studies with animal models show contradictory findings about the effect of swimming on bone health, highlighting the need for longitudinal studies. Due to its microgravity characteristics, swimming seems to impair bone mass, but mostly at the lower limbs. It is unkown if there is a causal relationship between swimming and low BMD or if other confounding factors, such as a natural selection whithin the sport, are the cause.

Methods A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted with 1720 individuals aged 20-59 years from Florianopolis, Brazil, in 2009. A two-stage cluster sample design was adopted, with a systematic selection of census tracts, followed by a random selection of households. All inhabitants of the selected households belonging to the age group of interest were considered eligible to participate. CMD were assessed using the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ > 7). Xerostomia was the outcome assessed by asking: "How often do you feel dry mouth?" with responses "often" and "always" taken as indicating xerostomia. Psychoactive medication intake was set as the mediator. Confounding factors included sex, age, per capita family income, educational attainment and smoking status. Marginal structural models were performed to quantify the CDE of CMD on xerostomia. Missing data were handled by multiple imputation by chained equations, and sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding was carried out. Results The overall prevalence of xerostomia was 8.8% and 15.3% of the individuals presented with CMD. After adjustment, the prevalence of xerostomia among individuals with CMD was 3.2 times higher than that among individuals without CMD (PR = 3.2 [95% CI: 2.3; 4.5]). The CDE of CMD on xerostomia which is not mediated by the medication intake resulted in a three times greater prevalence of xerostomia (PR = 3.0 95% CI: 2.0; 4.5) among those individuals with CMD. Conclusions Common mental disorders is directly and negatively associated with xerostomia. Clinicians should bear in mind the emotional state when investigating the underlying factors and managing patients with xerostomia.

Lipophilic pollutants and nutrients, like dioxins and polyunsaturated fatty acids, may often converge at all aforementioned levels and thus the interactions become more likely. Despite this fact, the topic seems overlooked in mainstream epidemiological research. In this essay, we illustrate different levels of documented interactions between pollutants and nutrients with experimental, interventional and epidemiological evidence, paying special attention to lipophilic chemicals. We first describe common pollutants and nutrients encountered in diets and the internal lipophilic interface such as adipose tissue and serum lipids. Next, we discuss the preventive effects of nutrients against absorption and the toxic effects of pollutants, as well as the pollutant-induced perturbation of nutrient metabolism. Finally, we discuss the implications of nutrient-pollutant interactions in epidemiology, providing some examples of negative confounding, modification effect and statistical interactions reported for different outcomes including fetal growth, diabetes and cancer. The evidence discussed in this essay supports that the health impacts of chemicals have likely been underestimated due to the high risk of residual and coexposure confounding in diseases where interactions between pollutants and nutrients may occur.

Standard statistical methods are available for analyzing longitudinal data, but the literature reveals that these methods are poorly understood by practitioners. METHODS: We review standard statistical methods for modeling longitudinal data. Marginal, conditional, and transitional approaches are reviewed and contrasted with respect to their parameter interpretation and methods for accounting for correlation and dealing with missing data. We also discuss techniques for controlling for time-dependent and time-independent confounding and for exploring and summarizing panel study data. Notes on available software are provided. RESULTS: These methods are illustrated by using data from the 1999 to 2002 Seattle Panel Study. CONCLUSIONS: The quality of statistical analyses and presentation of results of panel studies could be improved if the methods we present were followed. Ann Epidemiol 2008;18:792-802.

New training tools for new epidemiologists	ENVIRONMENTAL AND MOLECULAR MUTAGENESIS			English	Article						teaching; molecular epidemiology; problem-based learning	SYSTEMS EPIDEMIOLOGY; HUMAN-DISEASE; MEDICINE	Molecular epidemiology is moving from an era of single marker studies to omics-driven population-based studies, made possible by recent rapid technological advances in high-throughput laboratory assays. The use of these assays in large, observational, epidemiologic studies poses major methodological challenges. The traditional, reductionist approach that most epidemiologists have been taught is no longer sufficient with the introduction of omics data into epidemiology. However, basic epidemiological principles, such as confounding, must still be addressed. In order to successfully implement these tools into molecular epidemiology, scientists in the required disciplines must be able to effectively communicate. We propose an interdisciplinary, three-level, problem-based approach to training in molecular epidemiology. This approach requires interdisciplinary teaching teams that appeal to students coming from diverse backgrounds. First, concepts from each field necessary for molecular epidemiology must be addressed at a basic level, with a specific focus on biological, epidemiological, and statistical concepts. Second, state-of the art methods applied in molecular epidemiology should be covered (e.g., omics technologies, smart study designs, statistical modeling, and biological interpretation). Third, the application of omics technologies in population studies calls for awareness of issues related to biobanking, ethics, legislation, and public health. Problem-based learning is a useful tool for teaching when students need to apply complex concepts to complex situations as is the case in molecular epidemiology. Using this approach, students from diverse backgrounds work together to analyze problems, discuss, and exchange knowledge in modern molecular epidemiology. Training tools characterized by this approach will shape the molecular epidemiologists of the future. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.	[Arts, Ilja C.

In order to contribute evidence to this still unresolved question, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the association between air quality and daily suicides registered in Mexico City (MC) between 2000 and 2016. Air quality was measured based on exposure to particulate matter under 2.5 and 10 micrometers (mu m) (PM2.5 and PM10, respectively), ozone (O-3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), adjusting for weather variables (air temperature and relative humidity), and holidays. To this end, an ecologic time series analysis was performed using a Poisson regression model conditioned by time and stratified by gender and age groups. Models were also generated to explore the lagged and accumulative effects of air pollutants, adjusted by weather variables. The effects of the pollutants were very close to the null value in the majority of the models, and no accumulative effects were identified. We believe these results, in this case, no evidence of a statistical association, contribute to the current debate about whether the association between air pollution and suicide reported in the scientific literature reflects an actual effect or an uncontrolled confounding effect.

Adjustment for time-invariant and time-varying confounders in 'unexplained residuals' models for longitudinal data within a causal framework and associated challenges	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Unexplained residuals model; conditional regression model; conditional analysis; conditional growth; conditional weight; conditional size; directed acyclic graph; causal inference; lifecourse epidemiology	CATCH-UP GROWTH; BLOOD-PRESSURE; WEIGHT-GAIN; FETAL ORIGINS; BIRTH-WEIGHT; INFANT GROWTH; BODY-COMPOSITION; EARLY-LIFE; CHILDHOOD; OUTCOMES	'Unexplained residuals' models have been used within lifecourse epidemiology to model an exposure measured longitudinally at several time points in relation to a distal outcome. It has been claimed that these models have several advantages, including: the ability to estimate multiple total causal effects in a single model, and additional insight into the effect on the outcome of greater-than-expected increases in the exposure compared to traditional regression methods. We evaluate these properties and prove mathematically how adjustment for confounding variables must be made within this modelling framework. Importantly, we explicitly place unexplained residual models in a causal framework using directed acyclic graphs. This allows for theoretical justification of appropriate confounder adjustment and provides a framework for extending our results to more complex scenarios than those examined in this paper. We also discuss several interpretational issues relating to unexplained residual models within a causal framework. We argue that unexplained residual models offer no additional insights compared to traditional regression methods, and, in fact, are more challenging to implement; moreover, they artificially reduce estimated standard errors. Consequently, we conclude that unexplained residual models, if used, must be implemented with great care.	[Arnold, K. F.; Ellison, G. T. H.; Tennant, P. W. G.; Heppenstall, A.; Gilthorpe, M.

J	Lee, D; McLanahan, S				Lee, Dohoon; McLanahan, Sara			Family Structure Transitions and Child Development: Instability, Selection, and Population Heterogeneity	AMERICAN SOCIOLOGICAL REVIEW			English	Article						family structure transitions; child development; instability; selection; population heterogeneity	FRAGILE FAMILIES; RACE DIFFERENCES; RISK; DISADVANTAGE; COHABITATION; ASSOCIATIONS; REMARRIAGE; STABILITY; DIVORCE; MODELS	A growing literature documents the importance of family instability for child wellbeing. In this article, we use longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study to examine the impacts of family instability on children's cognitive and socioemotional development in early and middle childhood. We extend existing research in several ways: (1) by distinguishing between the number and types of family structure changes; (2) by accounting for time-varying as well as time-constant confounding; and (3) by assessing racial/ethnic and gender differences in family instability effects. Our results indicate that family instability has a causal effect on children's development, but the effect depends on the type of change, the outcome assessed, and the population examined. Generally speaking, transitions out of a two-parent family are more negative for children's development than transitions into a two-parent family. The effect of family instability is more pronounced for children's socioemotional development than for their cognitive achievement. For socioemotional development, transitions out of a two-parent family are more negative for white children, whereas transitions into a two-parent family are more negative for Hispanic children. These findings suggest that future research should pay more attention to the type of family structure transition and to population heterogeneity.

Protocol for a target trial using multiple national Swedish registries	BMJ OPEN			English	Article						Stroke; Dementia; EPIDEMIOLOGY; STATISTICS & RESEARCH METHODS	SECONDARY NEURODEGENERATION; CAUSAL INFERENCE; CORTEX ISCHEMIA; EARLY-ONSET; STROKE; MICROGLIA; DISEASE; INJURY; VALIDATION; IMPAIRMENT	Introduction The target of a class of antiplatelet medicines, P2Y12R inhibitors, exists both on platelets and on brain immune cells (microglia). This protocol aims to describe a causal (based on a counterfactual model) approach for analysing whether P2Y12R inhibitors prescribed for secondary prevention poststroke may increase the risk of cognitive disorder or dementia via their actions on microglia, using real-world evidence. Methods and analysis This will be a cohort study nested within the Swedish National Health and Medical Registers, including all people with incident stroke from 2006 to 2016. We developed directed acyclic graphs to operationalise the causal research question considering potential time-independent and time-dependent confounding, using input from several experts. We developed a study protocol following the components of the target trial approach described by Hernan et al and describe the data structure that would be required in order to make a causal inference. We also describe the statistical approach required to derive the causal estimand associated with this important clinical question; that is, a time-to-event analysis for the development of cognitive disorder or dementia at 1, 2 and 5-year follow-up, based on approaches for competing events to account for the risk of all-cause mortality. Causal effect estimates and the precision in these estimates will be quantified. Ethics and dissemination This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Gothenburg and Confidentiality Clearance at Statistics Sweden with Dnr 937-18, and an approved addendum with Dnr 2019-0157. The analysis and interpretation of the results will be heavily reliant on the structure, quality and potential for bias of the databases used. When we implement the protocol, we will consider and document any biases specific to the dataset and conduct appropriate sensitivity analyses. Findings will be disseminated to local stakeholders via conferences, and published in appropriate scientific journals.

The amount of attenuation introduced in a given situation is not only a function of the precision of the exposure measurement but also depends on the conditional variance of the true exposure given the other independent variables. In addition, confounder effects may also be affected by the exposure measurement error. These difficulties in statistical model development are illustrated by examples from a epidemiological study performed in the Faroe Islands to investigate the adverse health effects of prenatal mercury exposure.

Intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired bacteraemia and ICU mortality and discharge: addressing time-varying confounding using appropriate methodology	JOURNAL OF HOSPITAL INFECTION			English	Article						Burden; Intensive care units; Bacteraemia; Inverse probability weighting; Bias	BLOOD-STREAM INFECTIONS; MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; ATTRIBUTABLE MORTALITY; NOSOCOMIAL INFECTIONS; MULTISTATE MODELS; RISK-FACTORS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; POPULATION	Background: Studies often ignore time-varying confounding or may use inappropriate methodology to adjust for time-varying confounding. Aim: To estimate the effect of intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired bacteraemia on ICU mortality and discharge using appropriate methodology. Methods: Marginal structural models with inverse probability weighting were used to estimate the ICU mortality and discharge associated with ICU-acquired bacteraemia among patients who stayed more than two days at the general ICU of a London teaching hospital and remained bacteraemia-free during those first two days. For comparison, the same associations were evaluated with (i) a conventional Cox model, adjusting only for baseline confounders and (ii) a Cox model adjusting for baseline and time-varying confounders. Findings: Using the marginal structural model with inverse probability weighting, bacteraemia was associated with an increase in ICU mortality (cause-specific hazard ratio (CSHR): 1.29; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02-1.63)and a decrease in discharge (CSHR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.45-0.60). By 60 days, among patients still in the ICU after two days and without prior bacteraemia, 8.0% of ICU deaths could be prevented by preventing all ICU-acquired bacteraemia cases. The conventional Cox model adjusting for time-varying confounders gave substantially different results [for ICU mortality, CSHR: 1.08 (95% CI: 0.88-1.32); for discharge, CSHR: 0.68 (95% CI: 0.60-0.77)]. Conclusion: In this study, even after adjusting for the timing of acquiring bacteraemia and time-varying confounding using inverse probability weighting for marginal structural	[Pouwels, K.

We sought to determine the true association between alcohol intake and OA. We conducted a PRISMA systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies that reported associations between alcohol consumption and OA. Pooled estimates of association were represented through odds ratios (ORs). Publication bias was assessed with Funnel and Galbraith plots, and risk of bias was assessed with the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. We included 29 studies and 25,192 subjects with OA and reported an OR between any alcohol consumption and OA of 0.79 (0.68-0.93), suggesting a protective effect. OR of weekly or more frequent use was 0.79 (0.65-0.97). When grouped by covariates, alcohol consumption was negatively associated with radiographic (0.83, 0.70-0.98), hand (0.80, 0.66-0.95) and knee OA (0.85, 0.72-0.99), North American ethnicity and female gender. Subgroup analysis of unadjusted data resulted in an OR of 0.70 (0.55-0.89) but this disappeared upon analysis of studies with data adjusted for any covariate (0.93, 0.78-1.10). Whilst our pooled analysis suggest that weekly or more frequent alcohol consumption was negatively associated with OA, this was not observed when adjusted for confounding factors. Reasons for this include selection bias and lack of longitudinal exposure and adjustment for confounding variables. Therefore, this meta-analysis provides evidence to dispel notions that alcohol use may be protective against OA.

The approach is based on an instrumental propensity score conditional on baseline variables, which can then be incorporated in matching, regression, subclassification, or weighting along with various parametric, semiparametric, or nonparametric methods for the assessment of treatment effects. Therefore, the application of the instrumental propensity score allows different methods for outcome effect evaluations in addition to standard 2-stage least square models while controlling for unmeasured confounders. Several properties of the instrumental propensity score are discussed. The approach is then illustrated using subclassification along with a semiparametric density ratio model and empirical likelihood. This method allows us to evaluate distributional and subgroup treatment effects in addition to the overall average treatment effect. Simulation studies showed that the method works well. We applied our method to a study of the effects of attending a Catholic school versus a public school and found that attending a Catholic school had significant beneficial effects on subsequent wages among a subgroup of subjects.

Methods: We use directed acyclic graphs, regression modeling, and sensitivity analyses to explore whether the observed protective effect of obesity among individuals with CVD can be plausibly attributed to selection bias. Data from the third National Health and Examination Survey was used for the analyses. Results: The adjusted total effect of obesity on mortality was a risk difference (RD) of 0.03 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.02, 0.05). However, the controlled direct effect of obesity on mortality among individuals without CVD was RD = 0.03 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.05) and RD = 0.12 (95% CI: -0.20, -0.04) among individuals with CVD. The adjusted total effect estimate demonstrates an increased number of deaths among obese individuals relative to nonobese counterparts, whereas the controlled direct effect shows a paradoxical decrease in morality among obese individuals with CVD. Conclusions: Sensitivity analysis demonstrates unmeasured confounding of the mediator-outcome relationship provides a sufficient explanation for the observed protective effect of obesity on mortality among individuals with CVD.

Chronic Disease Prevention Research Methods and Their Reliability, With Illustrations From the Women's Health Initiative	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Biomarker; Chronic disease prevention; Clinical trial; Cohort study; Confounding; Measurement error	CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; FAT DIETARY PATTERN; POSTMENOPAUSAL HORMONE-THERAPY; ESTROGEN PLUS PROGESTIN; BREAST-CANCER; CLINICAL-TRIAL; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; REGRESSION-MODELS; PROSTATE-CANCER; PLASMA PROTEOME	This article reviews the status of statistical methods for chronic disease prevention research, with emphasis on the reliability of findings and on future methodological needs and opportunities. Observational studies, especially cohort studies, play a major role in disease prevention research, but depend on adequate confounding control methods for a useful interpretation. Stratification and regression methods that are commonly used to control confounding are described, and comparative findings from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized controlled trial and companion cohort study of the benefits and risk of postmenopausal hormone therapy are used to illustrate the success of these methods. Measurement error in exposure assessment may be a potentially dominating source of bias in such important prevention research areas as nutrition and physical activity epidemiology. Statistical methods to correct for measurement error are briefly reviewed, and the need for methods to accommodate systematic bias in exposure assessment is described. Recent analysis using nutrient exposure biomarkers in WHI cohorts is used to illustrate the impact of such methods. Randomized, controlled intervention trials have the potential to obviate these biases and to reliably assess intervention benefits and risks. However, trials in healthy persons with chronic disease outcomes are typically large, long-term, and expensive. Statistical methods for randomized, controlled prevention trials are briefly reviewed, and the roles of trials in the overall chronic disease prevention research enterprise are examined. Given the logistical and cost challenges, a full-scale disease prevention trial needs to be preceded by careful hypothesis development and initial testing. The potential role of biomarkers, especially high-dimensional biomarkers, in disease prevention hypothesis development, is described and illustrated. The presentation concludes with comments on the methodological research and research infrastructure developments needed to invigorate the chronic disease prevention research agenda, with emphasis on the important role for statisticians in enhancing prevention research methods and applications.

However, the causality of such neighbourhood effects remains uncertain. Methods We followed all children born in Sweden from 1975-1989 who lived in its three largest cities by the age of 15 years and for whom complete information was available about individual and contextual factors (N = 303 465). All biological siblings were identified in the sample (N = 179 099). Generalized linear mixed-effects models were used to assess the effect of neighbourhood deprivation on violent criminality and substance misuse between the ages of 15 and 20 years, while taking into account the cross-classified data structure (i.e. siblings in the same families attending different schools and living in different neighbourhoods at age 15). Results In the crude model, an increase of 1 SD in neighbourhood deprivation was associated with a 57% increase in the odds of being convicted of a violent crime (95% CI 52%-63%). The effect was greatly attenuated when adjustment was made for a number of observed confounders (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.06-1.11). When we additionally adjusted for unobserved familial confounders, the effect was no longer present (OR 0.96, 95% CI 0.84-1.10). Similar results were observed for substance misuse. The results were not due to poor variability either between neighbourhoods or within families. Conclusions We found that the adverse effect of neighbourhood deprivation on adolescent violent criminality and substance misuse in Sweden was not consistent with a causal inference. Instead, our findings highlight the need to control for familial confounding in multilevel studies of criminality and substance misuse.

J	Rosenman, S				Rosenman, S			Trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder in Australia: findings in the population sample of the Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing	AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						community surveys; epidemiology and statistics; posttraumatic stress dis-orders; risk factors; sex factors	EPIDEMIOLOGY; COMMUNITY; IMPACT	Aim: To investigate the distribution and risk factors for trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder in the Australian population sample taken for the 1997 National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing. Methods: The confidentialised unit record file (CURF) was prepared by the Australian Bureau of Statistics from the survey sample of 10 641 adults. It was interrogated for the lifetime experience of specific trauma and the 12-month prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder according to DSM-IV and ICD-10. Univariate and multivariate analyses were applied to quantify risks for traumatic experience and for DSM-IV posttraumatic stress disorder. Results: Fifty-seven per cent of the population reported lifetime experience of the specified trauma. Men were more likely to experience most traumas and multiple traumas except for sexual assaults. The twelve-month prevalence of DSM-IV posttraumatic stress disorder in the overall adult population was 1.5%. It occurred in 3.8% of women and 2.0% of men who had experienced trauma. While female gender, youth, lower education and residence in poorer areas predicted posttraumatic stress disorder after trauma, multivariate analysis showed that the nature of trauma (especially sexual assault) predominated. Gender ceased to be a significant contributor to the risk of posttraumatic stress disorder when analysis controlled for type and number of trauma, and for the passage of time. Conclusion: Trauma is ubiquitous in the community and posttraumatic stress disorder is comparatively less common, persisting into the past year in 2.8% of those who have experienced lifetime trauma. The conventional models of female susceptibility to post-traumatic stress disorder are not supported in this sample. The type of trauma appears the most important determinant of progression to posttraumatic stress disorder. These com-munity prevalence statistics complement causal understanding that comes from studies of clinical and other special populations in which posttraumatic stress disorder and selection for treatment may be confounded.

We explore these two approaches in a study of intravenous iron use in hemodialysis patients treated concurrently with epoetin alfa (EPO). Study Design and Setting: We linked US Renal Data System data with electronic health records (2004-2008) from a large dialysis provider. Using a retrospective cohort design with 776,203 records from 117,050 regular hemodialysis patients, we examined a composite outcome: mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Results: With EPO as a joint treatment, inverse-probability-of-treatment weights were unstable, confidence intervals for treatment effects were wide, covariate balance was unsatisfactory, and the treatment and outcome models were sensitive to omission of the baseline EPO covariate. By handling EPO exposure as a confounder instead of a joint treatment, we derived stable weights and balanced treatment groups on measured covariates. Conclusions: In settings with concurrent treatments, if only one treatment is of interest, then including the other in the treatment model as a confounder may result in more stable treatment effect estimates. Otherwise, extreme weights may necessitate additional analysis steps. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	[Ellis, Alan R.; Brookhart, M.

We aimed to investigate a possible causal relationship between body mass index (BMI) and psoriasis. Methods and findings Following a review of published epidemiological evidence of the association between obesity and psoriasis, mendelian randomization (MR) was used to test for a causal relationship with BMI. We used a genetic instrument comprising 97 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with BMI as a proxy for BMI (expected to be much less confounded than measured BMI). One-sample MR was conducted using individual-level data (396,495 individuals) from the UK Biobank and the Nord-Trondelag Health Study (HUNT), Norway. Two-sample MR was performed with summary-level data (356,926 individuals) from published BMI and psoriasis genome-wide association studies (GWASs). The one-sample and two-sample MR estimates were meta-analysed using a fixed-effect model. To test for a potential reverse causal effect, MR analysis with genetic instruments comprising variants from recent genome-wide analyses for psoriasis were used to test whether genetic risk for this skin disease has a causal effect on BMI. Published observational data showed an association of higher BMI with psoriasis. A mean difference in BMI of 1.26 kg/m(2) (95% CI 1.02-1.51) between psoriasis cases and controls was observed in adults, while a 1.55 kg/m(2) mean difference (95% CI 1.13-1.98) was observed in children. The observational association was confirmed in UK Biobank and HUNT data sets. Overall, a 1 kg/m(2) increase in BMI was associated with 4% higher odds of psoriasis (meta-analysis odds ratio [OR] = 1.04; 95% CI 1.03-1.04; P = 1.73 x 10(-60)). MR analyses provided evidence that higher BMI causally increases the odds of psoriasis (by 9% per 1 unit increase in BMI; OR = 1.09 (1.06-1.12) per 1 kg/m(2); P = 4.67 x 10(-9)). In contrast, MR estimates gave little support to a possible causal effect of psoriasis genetic risk on BMI (0.004 kg/m(2) change in BMI per doubling odds of psoriasis (-0.003 to 0.011). Limitations of our study include possible misreporting of psoriasis by patients, as well as potential misdiagnosis by clinicians. In addition, there is also limited ethnic variation in the cohorts studied. Conclusions Our study, using genetic variants as instrumental variables for BMI, provides evidence that higher BMI leads to a higher risk of psoriasis. This supports the prioritization of therapies and lifestyle interventions aimed at controlling weight for the prevention or treatment of this common skin disease. Mechanistic studies are required to improve understanding of this relationship.

Tools for assessing quality and susceptibility to bias in observational studies in epidemiology: a systematic review and annotated bibliography	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						observational studies; epidemiological studies; quality; bias; checklist; scales	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIALS; CLINICAL-PRACTICE GUIDELINES; CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; CRITICAL-APPRAISAL; MEDICAL LITERATURE; RISK-FACTORS; METHODOLOGIC STANDARDS; RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS; ORAL-CONTRACEPTIVES; ALCOHOL-CONSUMPTION	Background Assessing quality and susceptibility to bias is essential when interpreting primary research and conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Tools for assessing quality in clinical trials are well-described but much less attention has been given to similar tools for observational epidemiological studies. Methods Tools were identified from a search of three electronic databases, bibliographies and an Internet search using Google((R)). Two reviewers extracted data using a pre-piloted extraction form and strict inclusion criteria. Tool content was evaluated for domains potentially related to bias and was informed by the STROBE guidelines for reporting observational epidemiological studies. Results A total of 86 tools were reviewed, comprising 41 simple checklists, 12 checklists with additional summary judgements and 33 scales. The number of items ranged from 3 to 36 (mean 13.7). One-third of tools were designed for single use in a specific review and one-third for critical appraisal. Half of the tools provided development details, although most were proposed for future use in other contexts. Most tools included items for selection methods (92%), measurement of study variables (86%), design-specific sources of bias (86%), control of confounding (78%) and use of statistics (78%); only 4% addressed conflict of interest. The distribution and weighting of domains across tools was variable and inconsistent. Conclusion A number of useful assessment tools have been identified by this report. Tools should be rigorously developed, evidence-based, valid, reliable and easy to use. There is a need to agree on critical elements for assessing susceptibility to bias in observational epidemiology and to develop appropriate evaluation tools.

When the outcome variable is binary relationships such as collapsibility, valid for the linear model, do not always hold. This article examines uses of the propensity score when both exposure and outcome are binary variables and the parameter of interest is the marginal odds ratio. We review stratification and matching by the propensity score when calculating the Mantel-Haenszel estimator and show that it is consistent for neither the marginal nor conditional odds ratio. We also investigate a marginal odds ratio estimator based on doubly robust estimators and summarize its performance relative to other recently proposed estimators under various conditions, including low exposure prevalence and model misspecification. Finally, we apply all estimators to a case study estimating the effect of Medicare plan type on the quality of care received by African-American breast cancer patients.

We assessed the impact of omitting confounders from a PS analysis on clinical decision making. Study Design and Setting: We conducted Monte Carlo simulations on hypothetical observational studies based on virtual populations and on the population from a large randomized trial (CRASH-2). In both series of simulations, PS analysis was conducted with all confounders and with omitted confounders, which were defined to have different strengths of association with the outcome and treatment exposure. After inverse probability of treatment weighting, we calculated the absolute risk differences and numbers needed to treat (NNT). Results: In both series of simulations, omitting a confounder that was moderately associated with the outcome and exposure led to negligible bias on the NNT scale. The bias induced by omitting strongly positive confounding variables remained less than 15 patients to treat. Major bias and reversed effects were found only when omitting highly prevalent, strongly negative confounders that were similarly associated with the outcome and exposure with odds ratios greater than 4.00 (or <0.25). This omission was accompanied by a substantial decrease in analysis power. Conclusion: The omission of strongly negative confounding variables from a PS analysis can lead to incorrect clinical decision making. However, omitting these variables also decreases the analysis power, which may prevent the reporting of significant but misleading effects. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

It is well known that if the treatments are not randomized (as in observational studies), covariate adjustment is necessary to account for treatment imbalances due to confounding factors. In this article, we propose a simple doubly-robust pseudo-value approach to effectively estimate the difference in the RML between two groups (akin to a metric for estimating average causal effects), while accounting for confounders. The proposed method combines two general approaches: (a) group-specific regression models for the time-to-event and covariate information, and (b) inverse probability of treatment assignment weights, where the RMLs are replaced by the corresponding pseudo-observations for survival outcomes, thereby mitigating the estimation complexities in presence of censoring. The proposed estimator is double-robust, in the sense that it is consistent if at least one of the two working models remains correct. In addition, we explore the potential of available machine learning algorithms in causal inference to reduce possible bias of the causal estimates in presence of a complex association between the survival outcome and covariates. We conduct extensive simulation studies to assess the finite-sample performance of the pseudo-value causal effect estimators. Furthermore, we illustrate our methodology via application to a dataset from a breast cancer cohort study. The proposed method is implementable using the R package drRML, available in GitHub.

J	Wang, PP; Badley, EM; Gignac, M				Wang, PP; Badley, EM; Gignac, M			Exploring the role of contextual factors in disability models	DISABILITY AND REHABILITATION			English	Article						contextual factors; disability; mediator; moderator; ICIDH and ICF	LABOR-FORCE; DISABLEMENT; MEDIATORS; MODERATORS	Purpose. The objective of this paper is to define and categorize the types of relationships that contextual factors have within models of disability according to the WHO International Classification of Disability, Functioning, and Health (ICF) conceptual scheme. Method. A conceptual analysis building on the disability literature specifies the causal relationships for contextual factors in relation to the association between activity limitation and participation using a person with arthritis as an example. Results. From a statistical point of view, in relation to disability process, contextual factors can act as an independent factor, confounding factor, moderating factor, and mediating factor. How the role of a particular contextual factor is specified depends on the researcher's hypothesized disability framework and research goals. Moderating and mediating contextual factors are of particular importance in disability model specification. Various sub-types of moderating contextual factors are also identified. Conclusion. This paper provides a framework for the conceptualization of contextual factors in the examination of disability models. This framework has implications in constructing conceptual models as well as for setting up analytical plans. In light of the increasing awareness and application of the ICF model, we intend this work to stimulate additional discussion on this topic.

Association between <i>Mycobacterium avium</i> subspecies <i>paratuberculosis</i> infection and milk production in two California dairies	JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE			English	Article						Mycobacterium avium ssp paratuberculosis; fat-corrected milk; mixed-effect regression model; causal diagram	SOMATIC-CELL COUNTS; JOHNES-DISEASE; IMMUNOSORBENT-ASSAY; LACTATION CURVES; COWS; CATTLE; IMPACT; YIELD; ANTIBODIES; MASTITIS	The association between Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (MAP) and milk production was estimated on 2 California dairies using longitudinal data from 5,926 cows. Both study herds had moderate MAP seroprevalence, housed cows in freestalls, and had Johne's disease control programs. Cow MAP status was determined using both serum ELISA and fecal culture results from cows tested at dry-off and from whole-herd tests. Potential confounders were evaluated based on a causal diagram. Mixed models with 2 functions (splines) for days in milk (DIM) representing milk production pre- and postpeak used in similar studies were further modified to use each cow's observed DIM at peak and lactation length. Cows that were seropositive produced 2.5 kg less 4% fat-corrected milk (FCM) per day than their seronegative herdmates. In addition, cows that were fecal-culture positive by liquid culture and confirmed by PCR produced 2.2 kg less 4% FCM per day than their fecal-culture negative herdmates. The decrease in milk production in MAP test-positive compared with test-negative cows started in the second lactation. A switch in MAP status in either ELISA or fecal culture results from positive to negative had no significant association with milk production. Modified DIM functions that used the observed DIM at peak had better model fit than another function that assumed a fixed peak at 60 DIM. Cows that tested positive for MAP on serum ELISA or fecal culture produced less milk than cows that tested negative, and the association between MAP and milk production was not confounded by mastitis, elevated somatic cell counts, or uterine or metabolic cow conditions.

We controlled for confounding using propensity scores (PS). The extremely rare events setting renders the matching or stratification infeasible. In addition, the PS itself may be formed via different approaches to select confounders from a relatively long list of potential confounders. We carried out simulation experiments to compare different combinations of approaches: IPW or regression adjustment, with 1) including all potential confounders without selection, 2) selection based on univariate association between the candidate variable and the outcome, 3) selection based on change in effects (CIE). The simulation showed that IPW without selection leads to extremely large variances in the estimated odds ratio, which help to explain the empirical data analysis results that we had observed.

Observational data for comparative effectiveness research: An emulation of randomised trials of statins and primary prevention of coronary heart disease	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						as-treated analysis; comparative effectiveness; confounding; intention-to-treat analysis; inverse-probability weighting; per-protocol analysis; selection bias	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPHS; BODY-MASS INDEX; CAUSAL INFERENCE; RISK; MORTALITY; RANGE; BIAS	This article reviews methods for comparative effectiveness research using observational data. The basic idea is using an observational study to emulate a hypothetical randomised trial by comparing initiators versus non-initiators of treatment. After adjustment for measured baseline confounders, one can then conduct the observational analogue of an intention-to-treat analysis. We also explain two approaches to conduct the analogues of per-protocol and as-treated analyses after further adjusting for measured time-varying confounding and selection bias using inverse-probability weighting. As an example, we implemented these methods to estimate the effect of statins for primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) using data from electronic medical records in the UK. Despite strong confounding by indication, our approach detected a potential benefit of statin therapy. The analogue of the intention-to-treat hazard ratio (HR) of CHD was 0.89 (0.73, 1.09) for statin initiators versus non-initiators. The HR of CHD was 0.84 (0.54, 1.30) in the per-protocol analysis and 0.79 (0.41, 1.41) in the as-treated analysis for 2 years of use versus no use. In contrast, a conventional comparison of current users versus never users of statin therapy resulted in a HR of 1.31 (1.04, 1.66). We provide a flexible and annotated SAS program to implement the proposed analyses.

Negative log-binomial model with optimal robust variance to estimate the prevalence ratio, in cross-sectional population studies	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Cross-Sectional Studies; Prevalence Ratio; Logistic Models; Odds Ratio; Maximum Likelihood Estimation and Binomial Distribution		BackgroundCross-sectional studies are useful for the estimation of prevalence of a particular event with concerns in specific populations, as in the case of diseases or other public health interests. Most of these studies have been carried out with binary binomial logistic regression model which estimates OR values that could be overestimated due to the adjustment of the model. Thus, the selection of the best multivariate model for cross-sectional studies is a priority to control the overestimation of the associations.MethodsWe compared the precision of the estimates of the prevalence ratio (PR) of the negative Log-binomial model (NLB) with Mantel-Haenszel (MH) and the regression models Cox, Log-Poisson, Log-binomial, and the OR of the binary logistic regression in population-based cross-sectional studies. The prevalence from a previous cross-sectional study carried out in Colombia about the association of mental health disorders with the consumption of psychoactive substances (e.g., cocaine, marijuana, cigarette, alcohol and risk of consumption of psychoactive substances) were used. The precision of the point estimates of the PR was evaluated for the NLB model with robust variance estimates, controlled with confounding variables, and confidence interval of 95%.ResultsThe NLB model adjusted with robust variance showed accuracy in the measurements of crude PRs, standard errors of estimate and its corresponding confidence intervals (95%CI) as well as a high precision of the PR estimate and standard errors of estimate after the adjustment of the model by grouped age compared with the MH PR estimate.Obtained PRs and 95%CI entre NLB y MH were: cocaine consumption (2.931,IC95%: 0.723-11.889 vs. 2.913, IC95%: 0.786-12.845), marijuana consumption (3.444, IC95%: 1.856-6.391 vs. 3.407, IC95%: 1.848, 6.281), cigarette smoking (2.175,IC95%: 1.493, 3.167 vs. 2.209, IC95%: 1.518-3.214), alcohol consumption (1.243,IC95%: 1.158-1.334 vs. 1.241, IC95%: 1.157-1.332), and risk of consumption of psychoactive substances (1.086, IC95%: 1.047-1.127 vs. 1.086, IC95%: 1.047, 1.126). The NLB model adjusted with robust variance showed mayor precision when increasing the prevalence, then the other models with robust variance with respect to MH.ResultsThe NLB model adjusted with robust variance showed accuracy in the measurements of crude PRs, standard errors of estimate and its corresponding confidence intervals (95%CI) as well as a high precision of the PR estimate and standard errors of estimate after the adjustment of the model by grouped age compared with the MH PR estimate.Obtained PRs and 95%CI entre NLB y MH were: cocaine consumption (2.931,IC95%: 0.723-11.889 vs. 2.913, IC95%: 0.786-12.845), marijuana consumption (3.444, IC95%: 1.856-6.391 vs. 3.407, IC95%: 1.848, 6.281), cigarette smoking (2.175,IC95%: 1.493, 3.167 vs. 2.209, IC95%: 1.518-3.214), alcohol consumption (1.243,IC95%: 1.158-1.334 vs. 1.241, IC95%: 1.157-1.332), and risk of consumption of psychoactive substances (1.086, IC95%: 1.047-1.127 vs. 1.086, IC95%: 1.047, 1.126). The NLB model adjusted with robust variance showed mayor precision when increasing the prevalence, then the other models with robust variance with respect to MH.ConclusionsThe NLB model with robust variance was shown as a powerful strategy for the estimation of PRs for cross-sectional population-based studies, as high precision levels were identified for point estimators, standard errors of estimate and its corresponding confidence intervals, after the adjustment of confounding variables. In addition, it does not represent convergence issues for high prevalence cases (as it occur with the Log-binomial model) and could be considered in cases of overdispersion and with greater precision and goodness of fit than the other models with robust variance, as it was shown with the data set of the cross-sectional study used in here.

Time-varying effect moderation using the structural nested mean model: estimation using inverse-weighted regression with residuals	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						effect modification; time-varying covariates; time-varying treatment; time-varying exposure; time-varying confounding; inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting	RANDOMIZED-TRIALS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; INTERVENTIONS; NONCOMPLIANCE; ASSOCIATION; MEDIATION	This article considers the problem of examining time-varying causal effect moderation using observational, longitudinal data in which treatment, candidate moderators, and possible confounders are time varying. The structural nested mean model (SNMM) is used to specify the moderated time-varying causal effects of interest in a conditional mean model for a continuous response given time-varying treatments and moderators. We present an easy-to-use estimator of the SNMM that combines an existing regression-with-residuals (RR) approach with an inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting (IPTW) strategy. The RR approach has been shown to identify the moderated time-varying causal effects if the time-varying moderators are also the sole time-varying confounders. The proposed IPTW+RR approach provides estimators of the moderated time-varying causal effects in the SNMM in the presence of an additional, auxiliary set of known and measured time-varying confounders. We use a small simulation experiment to compare IPTW+RR versus the traditional regression approach and to compare small and large sample properties of asymptotic versus bootstrap estimators of the standard errors for the IPTW+RR approach. This article clarifies the distinction between time-varying moderators and time-varying confounders. We illustrate the methodology in a case study to assess if time-varying substance use moderates treatment effects on future substance use. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Wakefield, J				Wakefield, J			Sensitivity analyses for ecological regression	BIOMETRICS			English	Article						confounding; ecological fallacy; spatial dependence; spatial epidemiology; within-area variability	AGGREGATE DATA; DISEASE RISK; MORTALITY; SMOKING; HEALTH; BIASES	In many ecological regression studies investigating associations between environmental exposures and health outcomes, the observed relative risks are in the range 1.0-2.0. The interpretation of such small relative risks is difficult due to a variety of biases-some of which are unique to ecological data, since they arise from within-area variability in exposures/confounders. The potential for residual spatial dependence, due to unmeasured confounders and/or data anomalies with spatial structure, must also be considered, though it often will be of secondary importance when compared to the likely effects of unmeasured confounding and within-area variability in exposures/confounders. Methods for addressing sensitivity to these issues are described, along with an approach for assessing the implications of spatial dependence. An ecological study of the association between myocardial infarction and magnesium is critically reevaluated to determine potential sources of bias. It is argued that the sophistication of the statistical analysis should not outweigh the quality of the data, and that finessing models for spatial dependence will often not be merited in the context of ecological regression.

TEMPERATURE, NOT FINE PARTICULATE MATTER (PM2.5), IS CAUSALLY ASSOCIATED WITH SHORT-TERM ACUTE DAILY MORTALITY RATES: RESULTS FROM ONE HUNDRED UNITED STATES CITIES	DOSE-RESPONSE			English	Article						Air pollution health effects; PM2.5; time series; mortality rates; cardiovascular disease; causality; Granger-Sims; conditional independence tests; J-shaped dose-response curve	AIR-POLLUTION; PUBLIC-HEALTH	Exposures to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in air (C) have been suspected of contributing causally to increased acute (e. g., same-day or next-day) human mortality rates (R). We tested this causal hypothesis in 100 United States cities using the publicly available NMMAPS database. Although a significant, approximately linear, statistical C-R association exists in simple statistical models, closer analysis suggests that it is not causal. Surprisingly, conditioning on other variables that have been extensively considered in previous analyses (usually using splines or other smoothers to approximate their effects), such as month of the year and mean daily temperature, suggests that they create strong, nonlinear confounding that explains the statistical association between PM2.5 and mortality rates in this data set. As this finding disagrees with conventional wisdom, we apply several different techniques to examine it. Conditional independence tests for potential causation, non-parametric classification tree analysis, Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), and Granger-Sims causality testing, show no evidence that PM2.5 concentrations have any causal impact on increasing mortality rates. This apparent absence of a causal C-R relation, despite their statistical association, has potentially important implications for managing and communicating the uncertain health risks associated with, but not necessarily caused by, PM2.5 exposures.				tcoxdenver@aol.com							43	3	5	0	18	SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC	THOUSAND OAKS	2455 TELLER RD, THOUSAND OAKS, CA 91320 USA	1559-3258			DOSE-RESPONSE	Dose-Response		2013	11	3					319	343		10.2203/dose-response.12-034.Cox	http://dx.doi.org/10.2203/dose-response.12-034.Cox			25	Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging; Toxicology	Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED)	Pharmacology & Pharmacy; Radiology, Nuclear Medicine & Medical Imaging; Toxicology	201WM	23983662	Green Published, gold			2024-05-08	WOS:000323173700003
J	Yang, S				Yang, Shu			Semiparametric estimation of structural nested mean models with irregularly spaced longitudinal observations	BIOMETRICS			English	Article						causality; counting process; discretization; g&#8208; estimator; martingale	CAUSAL INFERENCE; TIME; NONCOMPLIANCE; THERAPY	Structural nested mean models (SNMMs) are useful for causal inference of treatment effects in longitudinal observational studies. Most existing works assume that the data are collected at prefixed time points for all subjects, which, however, may be restrictive in practice. To deal with irregularly spaced observations, we assume a class of continuous-time SNMMs and a martingale condition of no unmeasured confounding (NUC) to identify the causal parameters. We develop the semiparametric efficiency theory and locally efficient estimators for continuous-time SNMMs. This task is nontrivial due to the restrictions from the NUC assumption imposed on the SNMM parameter. In the presence of ignorable censoring, we show that the complete-case estimator is optimal among a class of weighting estimators including the inverse probability of censoring weighting estimator, and it achieves a double robustness feature in that it is consistent if at least one of the models for the potential outcome mean function and the treatment process is correctly specified. The new framework allows us to conduct causal analysis respecting the underlying continuous-time nature of data processes. The simulation study shows that the proposed estimator outperforms existing approaches. We estimate the effect of time to initiate highly active antiretroviral therapy on the CD4 count at year 2 from the observational Acute Infection and Early Disease Research Program database.

It remains unclear which PD criteria are most likely to drive onset and recurrence of AUD and which are merely confounded with those criteria. We determine which individual PD criteria predict AUD and the degree of underlying genetic and/or environmental aetiology. DesignA prospective observational twin study. SettingNorway 1999-2011. ParticipantsA total of 2528 and 2275 Norwegian adult twins in waves 1 and 2 variable-selection analyses, and 2785 in biometric analyses. MeasurementsDSM-IV PDs and their 80 criteria were assessed using a structured personal interview, and AUD using the World Health Organization's Composite International Diagnostic Interview. FindingsIn a variable-selection analysis, two PD criteria were associated with AUD even after taking all the other criteria into account: criterion 8 of antisocial PD (childhood conduct disorder) and criterion 4 of borderline PD (self-damaging impulsive behaviours). Adjusting for each other, their respective odds ratios were 3.4 [confidence interval (CI)=2.1-5.4] and 5.0 (CI=3.3-7.7). Endorsement strength of the criteria was associated with AUD in a dose-response manner and they explained 5.5% of variation in AUD riskmore than the full diagnoses of antisocial and borderline PDs together (0.5%). The association between borderline criterion 4 and AUD 10years later derived mainly from their overlapping genetic factors, whereas the association between antisocial criterion 8 and AUD 10years later was due to both genetic and non-genetic factors. ConclusionsConduct disorder and self-harming impulsivity are the foremost risk traits for alcohol use disorder among the 80 personality disorder criteria of DSM-IV, predicting alcohol use disorder more effectively than personality disorder diagnoses. The twin-study analysis suggested that conduct disorder represents a joint genetic and developmental risk for alcohol use disorder and that impulsivity is a genetic risk.

We hypothesised that the association between acquisition of disability and mental health is modified by housing tenure and affordability. We used twelve annual waves of data (2001-2012) (1913 participants, 13,037 observations) from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey. Eligible participants reported at least two consecutive waves of disability preceded by two consecutive waves without disability. Effect measure modification, on the additive scale, was tested in three fixed-effects linear regression models (which remove time-invariant confounding) which included a cross-product term between disability and prior housing circumstances: housing tenure by disability; housing affordability by disability and, in a sub sample (896 participants 5913 observations) with housing costs, tenure/affordability by disability. The outcome was the continuous mental component summary (MCS) of SF-36. Models adjusted for time varying confounders. There was statistical evidence that prior housing modified the effect of disability acquisition on mental health. Our findings suggested that those in affordable housing had a 1.7 point deterioration in MCS (95% CI-2.1,-1.3) following disability acquisition and those in unaffordable housing had a 4.2 point reduction (95% CI-5.2,-1.4). Among people with housing costs, the largest declines in MCS were for people with unaffordable mortgages (-5.3, 95% CI -8.8, -1.9) and private renters in unaffordable ousing (-4.0, 95% CI -6.3, -1.6), compared to a 1.4 reduction (95% CI -2.1, -0.7) for mortgagors in affordable housing. In sum, we used causally-robust fixed-effects regression and showed that deterioration in mental health following disability acquisition is modified by prior housing circumstance with the largest negative associations found for those in unaffordable housing. Future research should test whether providing secure, affordable housing when people acquire a disability prevents deterioration in mental health. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Subramanian, SV; Kawachi, I				Subramanian, SV; Kawachi, I			The association between state income inequality and worse health is not confounded by race	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						income inequality; self-rated health; race; multilevel analysis; US	SELF-RATED HEALTH; MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS; INDIVIDUAL INCOME; LIFE EXPECTANCY; UNITED-STATES; MORTALITY; LEVEL; STORY	Background The relationship between income inequality and health across US states has been challenged recently on grounds that this relationship may be confounded by the effect of racial composition, measured as the proportion of the state's population who are black. Methods Using multilevel statistical models, we examined the association between state income inequality and poor self-rated health. The analysis was based on the pooled 1995 and 1997 Current Population Surveys, comprising 201 221 adults nested within 50 US states. Results Controlling for the individual effects of age, sex, race, marital status, education, income, health insurance coverage, and employment status, we found a significant effect of state income inequality on poor self-rated health. For every 0.05-increase in the Gini coefficient, the odds ratio (OR) of reporting poor health increased by 1.39 (95% CI: 1.26, 1.51). Additionally controlling for the proportion of the state population who are black did not explain away the effect of income inequality (OR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.15, 1.45). While being black at the individual level was associated with poorer self-rated health, no significant relationship was found between poor self-rated health and the proportion of black residents in a state. Conclusion Our finding demonstrates that neither race, at the individual level, nor racial composition, as measured at the state level, explain away the previously reported association between income inequality and poorer health status in the US.

J	Langworthy, B; Wu, YJ; Wang, ML				Langworthy, Benjamin; Wu, Yujie; Wang, Molin			An overview of propensity score matching methods for clustered data	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Average treatment among the treated; clustered data; confounding; propensity score matching; propensity score estimation	CAUSAL INFERENCE; BALANCE; REGRESSION; DESIGNS; SCHOOLS	Propensity score matching is commonly used in observational studies to control for confounding and estimate the causal effects of a treatment or exposure. Frequently, in observational studies data are clustered, which adds to the complexity of using propensity score techniques. In this article, we give an overview of propensity score matching methods for clustered data, and highlight how propensity score matching can be used to account for not just measured confounders, but also unmeasured cluster level confounders. We also consider using machine learning methods such as generalized boosted models to estimate the propensity score and show that accounting for clustering when using these methods can greatly reduce the performance, particularly when there are a large number of clusters and a small number of subjects per cluster. In order to get around this we highlight scenarios where it may be possible to control for measured covariates using propensity score matching, while using fixed effects regression in the outcome model to control for cluster level covariates. Using simulation studies we compare the performance of different propensity score matching methods for clustered data across a number of different settings. Finally, as an illustrative example we apply propensity score matching methods for clustered data to study the causal effect of aspirin on hearing deterioration using data from the conservation of hearing study.

However, it has not yet been determined whether such model performance is driven by latent audio biomarkers with true causal links to SARS-CoV-2 infection or by confounding effects, such as recruitment bias, present in observational studies. Here we undertake a large-scale study of audio-based AI classifiers as part of the UK government's pandemic response. We collect a dataset of audio recordings from 67,842 individuals, with linked metadata, of whom 23,514 had positive polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS-CoV-2. In an unadjusted analysis, similar to that in previous works, AI classifiers predict SARS-CoV-2 infection status with high accuracy (ROC-AUC = 0.846 [0.838-0.854]). However, after matching on measured confounders, such as self-reported symptoms, performance is much weaker (ROC-AUC = 0.619 [0.594-0.644]). Upon quantifying the utility of audio-based classifiers in practical settings, we find them to be outperformed by predictions on the basis of user-reported symptoms. We make best-practice recommendations for handling recruitment bias, and for assessing audio-based classifiers by their utility in relevant practical settings. Our work provides insights into the value of AI audio analysis and the importance of study design and treatment of confounders in AI-enabled diagnostics. AI-enabled diagnostic applications in healthcare can be powerful, but study design is very important to avoid subtle issues of bias in the dataset and evaluation. Coppock et al. demonstrate how an AI-based classifier for diagnosing SARS-Cov-2 infection from audio recordings can seem to make predictions with high accuracy but shows much lower performance after taking into account confounders, providing insights in study design and replicability in AI-based audio analysis.

(2018), designed to assess whether exposure to neighborhood disavantage over time affects children's reading and math skills. Here, we provide corrected and new results. Reconsideration of the model in the original article raised concerns about bias due to expoure iduced confounding (i.e., past exposures directly affecting future exposures) and true state dependence (i.e., past exposures affecting confounders of future exposures). Through simulation, we show that our originally proposed propensity function approach displays modest bias due to exposureinduced confounding but no bias from true state dependence. We suggest a correction based on residualized values and show that this new approach corrects for the observed bias. We contrast this revised method with other causal modeling approaches using simulation. Finally, we reproduce the substantive models from Hicks et al. (2018) using the new residuals-based adjustment procedure. With the correction, our findings are essentially identical to those reported originally. We end with some conclusions regarding approaches to causal modeling.

Epidemiology of lung cancer among acrylonitrile-exposed study populations: A meta-analysis	REGULATORY TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						Acrylonitrile; Meta-analysis; Systematic review; Occupation; Chemical; Epidemiology; Lung cancer	CIGARETTE-SMOKING; MORTALITY UPDATE; WORKERS; PLANT; MEN	Purpose: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of lung cancer among acrylonitrile-exposed workers. Methods: A literature search through April 2020 was performed to identify relevant cohort and case-control studies. Data from these studies were meta-analyzed to generate summary relative risk estimates (SRREs). Heterogeneity was examined in sub-group and sensitivity analyses, and by meta-regression. Results: Twenty-two studies were reviewed systematically, and 10 cohort studies and one case-control study were meta-analyzed. Individual relative risk estimates reported across studies were heterogeneous, with most being relatively weak in statistical strength and non-statistically significant on both sides of the null value. Metaanalysis of these data resulted in an SRRE of 1.04 (95% CI: 0.89-1.21; overall model, largely consisting of all workers exposed to acrylonitrile). Sub-group analyses and meta-regression did not support patterns of positive dose-response relationships by duration of exposure/employment or cumulative exposure. Conclusions: Although some positive associations have been reported in internal comparison analyses based on increasing exposure categories, few associations are statistically significant, there are no apparent or consistent patterns of dose-response, and the confounding influence of cigarette smoking was not adequately controlled. Thus, findings from this review and meta-analysis do not support an increased risk of lung cancer among acrylonitrile workers.

When latent class growth analysis is combined with standard approaches like Cox proportional hazards models, confounding bias is not properly addressed because of time-varying covariates that have a double role of confounders and mediators. We propose to use latent class growth analysis to classify individuals into a few latent classes based on their medication adherence pattern, then choose a working marginal structural model that relates the outcome to these groups. The parameter of interest is defined as a projection of the true marginal structural model onto the chosen working model. Simulation studies are used to illustrate our approach and compare it with unadjusted, baseline covariates adjusted, time-varying covariates adjusted, and inverse probability of trajectory groups weighted adjusted models. Our proposed approach yielded estimators with little or no bias and appropriate coverage of confidence intervals in these simulations. We applied our latent class growth analysis and marginal structural model approach to a database comprising information on 52,790 individuals from the province of Quebec, Canada, aged more than 65 and who were statin initiators to estimate the effect of statin-usage trajectories on a first cardiovascular event.

Birthweight, gestational age and familial confounding in sex differences in infant mortality: a matched co-twin control study of Brazilian male-female twin pairs identified by population data linkage	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Twins; infant; neonatal; mortality; sex differences; birthweight; familial confounding; gestational age; data linkage; administrative data	NEONATAL-MORTALITY; MODELS; LENGTH	Background In infancy, males are at higher risk of dying than females. Birthweight and gestational age are potential confounders or mediators but are also familial and correlated, posing epidemiological challenges that can be addressed by studying male-female twin pairs. Methods We studied 28 558 male-female twin pairs born in Brazil between 2012 and 2016, by linking their birth and death records. Using a co-twin control study matched for gestational age and familial factors, we applied logistic regression with random effects (to account for paired data) to study the association between male sex and infant death, adjusting for: birthweight, within- and between-pair effects of birthweight, birth order and gestational age, including interactions. The main outcome was infant mortality (0-365 days) stratified by neonatal (early and late) and postneonatal deaths. Results Males were 100 g heavier and more at risk of infant death than their female co-twins before [odds ratio (OR) = 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11-1.49, P = 0.001] and after (OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.39-1.83, P <0.001) adjusting for birthweight and birth order. When adjusting for birthweight within-pair difference and mean separately, the OR attenuated to 1.40 (95% CI: 1.21-1.61, P <0.001), with evidence of familial confounding (likelihood ratio test, P <0.001). We found evidence of interaction (P = 0.001) between male sex and gestational age for early neonatal death. Conclusions After matching for gestational age and familial factors by design and controlling for birthweight and birth order, males remain at greater risk of infant death than their female co-twins. Birthweight's role as a confounder can be partially explained by familial factors.

J	Flanders, WD; Eldridge, RC				Flanders, William Dana; Eldridge, Ronald Curtis			Summary of relationships between exchangeability, biasing paths and bias	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Review						Confounding; Exchangeability; Bias; Biasing path; Causal effect; Directed acyclic graph	CAUSAL DIAGRAMS	Definitions and conceptualizations of confounding and selection bias have evolved over the past several decades. An important advance occurred with development of the concept of exchangeability. For example, if exchangeability holds, risks of disease in an unexposed group can be compared with risks in an exposed group to estimate causal effects. Another advance occurred with the use of causal graphs to summarize causal relationships and facilitate identification of causal patterns that likely indicate bias, including confounding and selection bias. While closely related, exchangeability is defined in the counterfactual-model framework and confounding paths in the causal-graph framework. Moreover, the precise relationships between these concepts have not been fully described. Here, we summarize definitions and current views of these concepts. We show how bias, exchangeability and biasing paths interrelate and provide justification for key results. For example, we show that absence of a biasing path implies exchangeability but that the reverse implication need not hold without an additional assumption, such as faithfulness. The close links shown are expected. However confounding, selection bias and exchangeability are basic concepts, so comprehensive summarization and definitive demonstration of links between them is important. Thus, this work facilitates and adds to our understanding of these important biases.				wflande@emory.edu		Eldridge, Ronald C/0000-0003-0221-7775					27	13	15	1	13	SPRINGER	DORDRECHT	VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS	0393-2990	1573-7284		EUR J EPIDEMIOL	Eur.

Estimates of causal effects at the population level from randomized controlled trials can still be biased if there are both effect modification and systematic differences between the trial sample and the ultimate population of inference with respect to these modifiers. Recent advances in the survey statistics literature to improve inference in nonprobability samples by using information from probability samples can provide an avenue for improving population causal inference in randomized controlled trials when relevant probability samples of the patient population are available. We review some recent work in "transporting" causal effect estimates from trials to populations, focusing on the setting where there is a "benchmark" or population-representative sample along with the RCT sample. We then propose estimators using either inverse probability weighting (IPWT) or prediction that can accommodate unequal probability of selection in the "benchmark" or population, and use Bayesian additive regression trees for both inverse probability of treatment weighting and prediction estimation that do not require specification of functional form or interaction. We also consider how the assumption of ignorability may be assessed from observed data and propose a sensitivity analysis under the failure of this assumption. We compare our proposed approach with existing methods in simulation and apply these alternative approaches to a study of pulmonary artery catheterization in critically ill patients. We also suggest next steps for future work.

J	ARRIGHI, HM; HERTZPICCIOTTO, I				ARRIGHI, HM; HERTZPICCIOTTO, I			THE EVOLVING CONCEPT OF THE HEALTHY WORKER SURVIVOR EFFECT	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						HEALTHY WORKER EFFECT; BIAS; CONFOUNDING FACTORS; EPIDEMIOLOGIC METHODS; STUDY DESIGN; ATA ANALYSIS; OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURES		The ''healthy worker survivor effect'' describes a continuing selection process such that those who remain employed tend to be healthier than those who leave employment. In an analysis of exposure response patterns in an occupational study, the healthy worker survivor effect generally attenuates an adverse effect of exposure. In practical terms, such attenuation will be more problematic when evaluating subtle rather than strong associations. The use of an internal referent does not guarantee elimination of this effect, since by definition, it manifests within an occupational cohort. Although documented over 100 years ago, there is little consensus regarding the most appropriate method to control for: the healthy worker survivor effect. Four methods have been Proposed for its control: (1) restriction of the cohort to survivors of a fixed number Of years of follow-up, (2) lagging the exposure to exclude recent exposure incurred by those who remained on the job, (3) adjusting for employment status as as a confounder, and (4) treating the healthy worker survivor effect simultaneously as an intermediate and confounding variable by means of the G-null test or its extension, G-estimation analysis, using structurally nested failure time models. This paper reviews the concept of the healthy worker survivor effect and the four methods to control for it.

In this article, we propose novel double score matching (DSM) utilizing both the propensity score and prognostic score. To gain the protection of possible model misspecification, we posit multiple candidate models for each score. We show that the debiasing DSM estimator achieves the multiple robustness property in that it is consistent if any one of the score models is correctly specified. We characterize the asymptotic distribution for the DSM estimator requiring only one correct model specification based on the martingale representations of the matching estimators and theory for local normal experiments. We also provide a two-stage replication method for variance estimation and extend DSM for quantile estimation. Simulation demonstrates DSM outperforms single-score matching and prevailing multiply robust weighting estimators in the presence of extreme propensity scores.

Mediation and moderation of treatment effects in randomised controlled trials of complex interventions	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article							COGNITIVE-BEHAVIORAL THERAPY; LEAST-SQUARES ESTIMATION; INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES; CAUSAL INFERENCE; CLINICAL-TRIALS; EARLY SCHIZOPHRENIA; POTENTIAL OUTCOMES; DATA SUBJECT; FOLLOW-UP; NO-SHOWS	Complex intervention trials should be able to answer both pragmatic and explanatory questions in order to test the theories motivating the intervention and help understand the underlying nature of the clinical problem being tested. Key to this is the estimation of direct effects of treatment and indirect effects acting through intermediate variables which are measured post-randomisation. Using psychological treatment trials as an example of complex interventions, we review statistical methods which crucially evaluate both direct and indirect effects in the presence of hidden confounding between mediator and outcome. We review the historical literature on mediation and moderation of treatment effects. We introduce two methods from within the existing causal inference literature, principal stratification and structural mean models, and demonstrate how these can be applied in a mediation context before discussing approaches and assumptions necessary for attaining identifiability of key parameters of the basic causal model. Assuming that there is modification by baseline covariates of the effect of treatment (i.e. randomisation) on the mediator (i.e. covariate by treatment interactions), but no direct effect on the outcome of these treatment by covariate interactions leads to the use of instrumental variable methods. We describe how moderation can occur through post-randomisation variables, and extend the principal stratification approach to multiple group methods with explanatory models nested within the principal strata. We illustrate the new methodology with motivating examples of randomised trials from the mental health literature.

J	Messer, LC				Messer, Lynne C.			Invited commentary: Beyond the metrics for measuring neighborhood effects	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Editorial Material						censuses; data collection; epidemiologic methods; psychometrics; residence characteristics; social class; social environment	LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; MULTILEVEL; HEALTH; RISK; SELECTION; CRIME; WOMEN	The "neighborhood effects'' literature, as currently constructed in epidemiology, would benefit from critical attention to the following four issues: 1) use of appropriate measurement tools and methods for neighborhood environments; 2) theoretical or conceptual guidance as to the aspects of residential environments most salient to human health (both within and across health endpoints); 3) the scale on which investigators measure neighborhood environments to best correspond to meaningful neighborhood boundaries and relevant neighborhood exposures; and 4) those selection and structural features that confound investigators' capacity to draw causal inferences from neighborhood environments to human health. In this issue of the Journal, Mujahid et al. (Am J Epidemiol 2007; 165: 858-867) report on the psychometric and ecometric results of their neighborhood scale testing. By providing a more rigorous approach to testing of neighborhood-attribute measurement tools, they make an important contribution to the literature. Also noteworthy is their explicit use of a conceptual model, which may facilitate the development of more meaningful area-level measures. Unfortunately, while Mujahid et al. had the capacity to consider spatially relevant measures, based on prior research and their conceptual model, they relied exclusively on aggregated census units. Hopefully, the scale issue will be addressed more thoroughly in future work.

Targeted learning in real-world comparative effectiveness research with time-varying interventions	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						targeted learning; marginal structural model; inverse probability weighting; efficiency gain; comparative effectiveness; diabetes	AMERICAN-DIABETES-ASSOCIATION; MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; DEMYSTIFYING DOUBLE ROBUSTNESS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; GLUCOSE-CONTROL; ALTERNATIVE STRATEGIES; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; EUROPEAN-ASSOCIATION; CONSENSUS STATEMENT; ADJUSTMENT	In comparative effectiveness research (CER), often the aim is to contrast survival outcomes between exposure groups defined by time-varying interventions. With observational data, standard regression analyses (e.g., Cox modeling) cannot account for time-dependent confounders on causal pathways between exposures and outcome nor for time-dependent selection bias that may arise from informative right censoring. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) estimation to fit marginal structural models (MSMs) has commonly been applied to properly adjust for these expected sources of bias in real-world observational studies. We describe the application and performance of an alternate estimation approach in such a study. The approach is based on the recently proposed targeted learning methodology and consists in targeted minimum loss-based estimation (TMLE) with super learning (SL) within a nonparametric MSM. The evaluation is based on the analysis of electronic health record data with both IPW estimation and TMLE to contrast cumulative risks under four more or less aggressive strategies for treatment intensification in adults with type 2 diabetes already on 2+ oral agents or basal insulin. Results from randomized experiments provide a surrogate gold standard to validate confounding and selection bias adjustment. Bootstrapping is used to validate analytic estimation of standard errors. This application does the following: (1) establishes the feasibility of TMLE in real-world CER based on large healthcare databases; (2) provides evidence of proper confounding and selection bias adjustment with TMLE and SL; and (3) motivates their application for improving estimation efficiency. Claims are reinforced with a simulation study that also illustrates the double-robustness property of TMLE. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

'Natural experiments' offer opportunities to generate credible causal treatment effect estimates from observational data. ObjectivesWe aimed first to review studies that employed 'natural experiments' to evaluate palliative care, and second to consider implications for expanding use of these methods. MethodsWe searched systematically seven databases to identify studies using 'natural experiments' to evaluate palliative care's effect on outcomes and costs. We searched three grey literature repositories, and hand-searched journals and prior systematic reviews. We assessed reporting using the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology checklist and a bespoke methodological quality tool, using two reviewers at each stage. We combined results in a narrative synthesis. ResultsWe included 17 studies, which evaluated a wide range of interventions and populations. Seven studies employed a difference-in-differences design; five each used instrumental variables and interrupted time series analysis. Outcomes of interest related mostly to healthcare use. Reporting quality was variable. Most studies reported lower costs and improved outcomes associated with palliative care, but a third of utilisation and place of death evaluations found no effect. ConclusionAmong the large number of observational studies in palliative care, a small minority have employed causal mechanisms. High-volume routine data collection, the expansion of palliative care services worldwide and recent methodological advances offer potential for increased use of 'natural experiments'. Such studies would improve the quality of the evidence base.

Method - Standardised morbidity ratios were calculated for cancers in Great Britain for 1981 and standardised mortality ratios for all cause mortality in Great Britain between 1982 and 1985. Deprivation indices were calculated for enumeration districts and wards from 1981 small area census statistics. Cancers and deaths were allocated to enumeration districts via their postcode. Standardised morbidity and mortality ratios were calculated by quintile of enumeration district according to the deprivation index. Standardised mortality ratios were further analysed by deprivation of ward, region, and urban/rural status. Results - Strong relationships were found between all cause mortality and the incidence of selected cancers and deprivation quintile - there was up to a twofold difference in lung cancer incidence between the highest and lowest quintile. The deprivation index can be used to measure gradients of deprivation according to the distance from industrial sites. The deprivation index for enumeration districts showed similar discrimination of mortality as the index for wards. There is some interaction between deprivation and region in their effect on the standardised mortality ratios, leading to a small bias in the estimation of expected numbers if this is not taken into account. The relationship between deprivation, urban/rural status, and mortality is complex and confounded by region, but mortality tends to be higher in urban than in rural areas within quintiles of deprivation. Discussion - Whether calculated for enumeration districts or wards, the main problems in the interpretation of the deprivation index may be its limited correlation with the risk factors of interest and its concentration on present rather than past socioeconomic status. Indirect standardisation based on stratification for deprivation and other variables involves a trade off between bias and precision in determining the fineness and the number of axes of stratification. Some bias may occur due to interaction between region and deprivation and the effects of urban/rural status. Complementary approaches including modelling and proportional mortality or morbidity analyses may be needed and the possibility of residual socioeconomic confounding must always be considered. Conclusion - There is potential for important socioeconomic confounding in small area studies of environmental pollution and health where the health outcome under examination has a strong relationship to socioeconomic status and where the putative excess risk due to pollution may be small. One method of controlling for confounding is to use an ecological measurement of deprivation in small areas, and to adjust for deprivation by indirect standardisation. However, residual socioeconomic confounding can be expected, which may seriously complicate the interpretation of small area studies.

Int Parkinson Dis Genomics Conso	Estimating the causal influence of body mass index on risk of Parkinson disease: A Mendelian randomisation study	PLOS MEDICINE			English	Article							METAANALYSIS; ASSOCIATION; INSTRUMENTS; OBESITY; BDNF; BIAS	Background Both positive and negative associations between higher body mass index (BMI) and Parkinson disease (PD) have been reported in observational studies, but it has been difficult to establish causality because of the possibility of residual confounding or reverse causation. To our knowledge, Mendelian randomisation (MR)-the use of genetic instrumental variables (IVs) to explore causal effects-has not previously been used to test the effect of BMI on PD. Methods and findings Two-sample MR was undertaken using genome-wide association (GWA) study data. The associations between the genetic instruments and BMI were obtained from the GIANT consortium and consisted of the per-allele difference in mean BMI for 77 independent variants that reached genome-wide significance. The per-allele difference in log-odds of PD for each of these variants was estimated from a recent meta-analysis, which included 13,708 cases of PD and 95,282 controls. The inverse-variance weighted method was used to estimate a pooled odds ratio (OR) for the effect of a 5-kg/m(2) higher BMI on PD. Evidence of directional pleiotropy averaged across all variants was sought using MR-Egger regression. Frailty simulations were used to assess whether causal associations were affected by mortality selection. A combined genetic IV expected to confer a lifetime exposure of 5-kg/m(2) higher BMI was associated with a lower risk of PD (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69-0.98). MR-Egger regression gave similar results, suggesting that directional pleiotropy was unlikely to be biasing the result (intercept 0.002; p = 0.654). However, the apparent protective influence of higher BMI could be at least partially induced by survival bias in the PD GWA study, as demonstrated by frailty simulations. Other important limitations of this application of MR include the inability to analyse non-linear associations, to undertake subgroup analyses, and to gain mechanistic insights. Conclusions In this large study using two-sample MR, we found that variants known to influence BMI had effects on PD in a manner consistent with higher BMI leading to lower risk of PD. The mechanism underlying this apparent protective effect warrants further study.

The instrumental variable (IV) design offers, under certain assumptions, the opportunity to tame confounding bias, without directly observing all confounders. The IV approach is very well developed in the context of linear regression and also for certain generalized linear models with a nonlinear link function. However, IV methods are not as well developed for regression analysis with a censored survival outcome. In this article, we develop the IV approach for regression analysis in a survival context, primarily under an additive hazards model, for which we describe 2 simple methods for estimating causal effects. The first method is a straightforward 2-stage regression approach analogous to 2-stage least squares commonly used for IV analysis in linear regression. In this approach, the fitted value from a first-stage regression of the exposure on the IV is entered in place of the exposure in the second-stage hazard model to recover a valid estimate of the treatment effect of interest. The second method is a so-called control function approach, which entails adding to the additive hazards outcome model, the residual from a first-stage regression of the exposure on the IV. Formal conditions are given justifying each strategy, and the methods are illustrated in a novel application to a Mendelian randomization study to evaluate the effect of diabetes on mortality using data from the Health and Retirement Study. We also establish that analogous strategies can also be used under a proportional hazards model specification, provided the outcome is rare over the entire follow-up.	[Tchetgen, Eric J.

J	Lipsky, AM; Greenland, S				Lipsky, Ari M.; Greenland, Sander			Confounding due to changing background risk in adaptively randomized trials	CLINICAL TRIALS			English	Article							CLINICAL-TRIALS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; DESIGNS; TIME; POPULATION; TRENDS	Background While adaptive trials tend to improve efficiency, they are also subject to some unique biases. Purpose We address a bias that arises from adaptive randomization in the setting of a time trend in disease incidence. Methods We use a potential-outcome model and directed acyclic graphs to illustrate the bias that arises from a changing subject allocation ratio with a concurrent change in background risk. Results In a trial that uses adaptive randomization, time trends in risk can bias the crude effect estimate obtained by naively combining the data from the different stages of the trial. We illustrate how the bias arises from an interplay of departures from exchangeability among groups and the changing randomization proportions. Limitations We focus on risk-ratio and risk-difference analysis. Conclusions Analysis of trials using adaptive randomization should involve attention to or adjustment for possible trends in background risk. Numerous modeling strategies are available for that purpose, including stratification, trend modeling, inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting, and hierarchical regression.

Determining the effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy on changes in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA viral load using a marginal structural left-censored mean model	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						acquired immunodeficiency syndrome; antiretroviral therapy; highly active; bias (epidemiology); causality; confounding factors (epidemiology); HIV-1; viral load	CAUSAL INFERENCE; CONTROLLED-TRIAL; HIV-1 INFECTION; ZIDOVUDINE; COHORT; EXCHANGEABILITY; IDENTIFIABILITY; INDINAVIR; SELECTION; PLASMA	Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) dramatically reduces the load of circulating human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by blocking replication at multiple points in the viral life cycle, but the long-term effect of HAART on viral load remains unclear. In the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study and the Women's Interagency HIV Study, 918 HIV-1-infected men and women who were not using antiretroviral therapy were followed for a median of 5.8 years between 1996 and 2005. Follow-up yielded 3,629 person-years of observation, during which 286 (31%) of the participants initiated HAART. A marginal structural left-censored linear model for semiannual repeated assessments of viral load showed a 1.9 log(10) decrease in viral load after HAART initiation as compared with nonuse (95% confidence interval: 1.7, 2.2), which remained stable over the course of follow-up but was stronger among men (interaction p < 0.001). This association was attenuated by 10% when the authors ignored the left-censoring of viral load measurements (which comprised 20% of measurements (1,420/7,258)) and attenuated by 57% when the authors adjusted for time-varying covariates in a standard fashion rather than using the marginal structural model. In conclusion, the clinically important protective effect of HAART on dampening viral load appears to be rapid, present at CD4 cell counts greater than 350 cells/mm(3), and sustained beyond 6 years.

Palliative care (PC) programs are typically evaluated using observational data, raising concerns about selection bias. Objectives. To quantify selection bias because of observed and unobserved characteristics in a PC demonstration program. Methods. Program administrative data and 100% Medicare claims data in two states and a 20% sample in eight states (2013-2017). The sample included 2983 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 65? participating in the PC program and three matched cohorts: regional; two states; and eight states. Confounding because of observed factors was measured by comparing patient baseline characteristics. Confounding because of unobserved factors was measured by comparing days of follow-up and six-month and one-year mortality rates. Results. After matching, evidence for observed confounding included differences in observable baseline characteristics, including race, morbidity, and utilization. Evidence for unobserved confounding included significantly longer mean follow-up in the regional, two-state, and eight-state comparison cohorts, with 207 (P< 0.001), 192 (P< 0.001), and 187 (P< 0.001) days, respectively, compared with the 162 days for the PC cohort. The PC cohort had higher six-month and one-year mortality rates of 53.5% and 64.5% compared with 43.5% and 48.0% in the regional comparison, 53.4% and 57.4% in the two-state comparison, and 55.0% and 59.0% in the eight-state comparison. Conclusion. This case study demonstrates that selection of comparison groups impacts the magnitude of measured and unmeasured confounding, which may change effect estimates. The substantial impact of confounding on effect estimates in this study raises concerns about the evaluation of novel serious illness care models in the absence of randomization. We present key lessons learned for improving future evaluations of PC using observational study designs. J Pain Symptom Manage 2021;61:1002-1011.

Quantitative Bias Analysis for a Misclassified Confounder A Comparison Between Marginal Structural Models and Conditional Models for Point Treatments	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Inverse probability weighting; Marginal structural models; Misclassification; Point-treatment study; Quantitative bias analysis	MEASUREMENT-ERROR; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; WEIGHTS	Observational data are increasingly used with the aim of estimating causal effects of treatments, through careful control for confounding. Marginal structural models estimated using inverse probability weighting (MSMs-IPW), like other methods to control for confounding, assume that confounding variables are measured without error. The average treatment effect in an MSM-IPW may however be biased when a confounding variable is error prone. Using the potential outcome framework, we derive expressions for the bias due to confounder misclassification in analyses that aim to estimate the average treatment effect using an marginal structural model estimated using inverse probability weighting (MSM-IPW). We compare this bias with the bias due to confounder misclassification in analyses based on a conditional regression model. Focus is on a point-treatment study with a continuous outcome. Compared with bias in the average treatment effect in a conditional model, the bias in an MSM-IPW can be different in magnitude but is equal in sign. Also, we use a simulation study to investigate the finite sample performance of MSM-IPW and conditional models when a confounding variable is misclassified. Simulation results indicate that confidence intervals of the treatment effect obtained from MSM-IPW are generally wider, and coverage of the true treatment effect is higher compared with a conditional model, ranging from overcoverage if there is no confounder misclassification to undercoverage when there is confounder misclassification. Further, we illustrate in a study of blood pressure-lowering therapy, how the bias expressions can be used to inform a quantitative bias analysis to study the impact of confounder misclassification, supported by an online tool.

Recent Findings Maternal exposures to air pollutants have been associated with pregnancy complications and adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. Causal mediation analysis enables us to estimate direct and indirect effects on outcomes (i.e., effect decomposition), elucidating causal mechanisms or effect pathways. Maternal metabolites and metabolic pathways are perturbed by air pollution exposures may lead to adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, thus they can be considered mediators in the causal pathways. Metabolomic markers have been used to explain the biological mechanisms linking air pollution and respiratory function, and of arsenic exposure and birth weight. However, mediation analysis of metabolomic markers has not been used to assess air pollution effects on adverse birth outcomes. In this article, we describe the assumptions and applications of mediation analysis using metabolomic markers that elucidate the potential mechanisms of the effects of air pollution on adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. The hypothesis of mediation along specified pathways can be assessed within the structural causal modeling framework. For causal inferences, several assumptions that go beyond the data-including no uncontrolled confounding-need to be made to justify the effect decomposition. Nevertheless, studies that integrate metabolomic information in causal mediation analysis may greatly improve our understanding of the effects of ambient air pollution on adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes as they allow us to suggest and test hypotheses about underlying biological mechanisms in studies of pregnant women.

Breast and bowel cancers diagnosed in people 'too young to have cancer': A blueprint for research using family and twin studies	GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						breast cancer; causation; colorectal cancer; DEPTH; familial confounding; family data; ICE CRISTAL; ICE FALCON; statistical methods; twin studies; VALID	COLORECTAL-CANCER; MAMMOGRAPHIC DENSITY; GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY; RISK-FACTORS; POLYGENIC RISK; NORDIC TWIN; OVARIAN; BRCA1; MODEL; ASSOCIATION	Young breast and bowel cancers (e.g., those diagnosed before age 40 or 50 years) have far greater morbidity and mortality in terms of years of life lost, and are increasing in incidence, but have been less studied. For breast and bowel cancers, the familial relative risks, and therefore the familial variances in age-specific log(incidence), are much greater at younger ages, but little of these familial variances has been explained. Studies of families and twins can address questions not easily answered by studies of unrelated individuals alone. We describe existing and emerging family and twin data that can provide special opportunities for discovery. We present designs and statistical analyses, including novel ideas such as the VALID (Variance in Age-specific Log Incidence Decomposition) model for causes of variation in risk, the DEPTH (DEPendency of association on the number of Top Hits) and other approaches to analyse genome-wide association study data, and the within-pair, ICE FALCON (Inference about Causation from Examining FAmiliaL CONfounding) and ICE CRISTAL (Inference about Causation from Examining Changes in Regression coefficients and Innovative STatistical AnaLysis) approaches to causation and familial confounding. Example applications to breast and colorectal cancer are presented. Motivated by the availability of the resources of the Breast and Colon Cancer Family Registries, we also present some ideas for future studies that could be applied to, and compared with, cancers diagnosed at older ages and address the challenges posed by young breast and bowel cancers.

J	Richiardi, L; Bellocco, R; Zugna, D				Richiardi, Lorenzo; Bellocco, Rino; Zugna, Daniela			Mediation analysis in epidemiology: methods, interpretation and bias	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Mediation analysis; direct effects; indirect effects	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPHS; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; BLACK-BOX; SURVIVAL; COMMON	In epidemiological studies it is often necessary to disentangle the pathways that link an exposure to an outcome. Typically the aim is to identify the total effect of the exposure on the outcome, the effect of the exposure that acts through a given set of mediators of interest (indirect effect) and the effect of the exposure unexplained by those same mediators (direct effect). The traditional approach to mediation analysis is based on adjusting for the mediator in standard regression models to estimate the direct effect. However, several methodological papers have shown that under a number of circumstances this traditional approach may produce flawed conclusions. Through a better understanding of the causal structure of the variables involved in the analysis, with a formal definition of direct and indirect effects in a counterfactual framework, alternative analytical methods have been introduced to improve the validity and interpretation of mediation analysis. In this paper, we review and discuss the impact of the three main sources of potential bias in the traditional approach to mediation analyses: (i) mediator-outcome confounding;(ii) exposure-mediator interaction and (iii) mediator-outcome confounding affected by the exposure. We provide examples and discuss the impact these sources have in terms of bias.

J	Glynn, RJ; Gagne, JJ; Schneeweiss, S				Glynn, Robert J.; Gagne, Joshua J.; Schneeweiss, Sebastian			Role of disease risk scores in comparative effectiveness research with emerging therapies	PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY			English	Article						confounding factors (epidemiology); propensity scores; epidemiological methods; statistical models	PROPENSITY SCORE; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; TERM MORTALITY; ADJUSTMENT; REGRESSION; STATINS; BIAS; STRATIFICATION; PERFORMANCE; STRATEGIES	Background Usefulness of propensity scores and regression models to balance potential confounders at treatment initiation may be limited for newly introduced therapies with evolving use patterns. Objectives To consider settings in which the disease risk score has theoretical advantages as a balancing score in comparative effectiveness research because of stability of disease risk and the availability of ample historical data on outcomes in people treated before introduction of the new therapy. Methods We review the indications for and balancing properties of disease risk scores in the setting of evolving therapies and discuss alternative approaches for estimation. We illustrate development of a disease risk score in the context of the introduction of atorvastatin and the use of high-dose statin therapy beginning in 1997, based on data from 56-68 older survivors of myocardial infarction who filled a statin prescription within 30?days after discharge from 1995 until 2004. Theoretical considerations suggested development of a disease risk score among nonusers of atorvastatin and high-dose statins during the period 1995-1997. Results Observed risk of events increased from 11% to 35% across quintiles of the disease risk score, which had a C-statistic of 0.71. The score allowed control of many potential confounders even during early follow-up with few study endpoints. Conclusions Balancing on a disease risk score offers an attractive alternative to a propensity score in some settings such as newly marketed drugs and provides an important axis for evaluation of potential effect modification. Joint consideration of propensity and disease risk scores may be valuable. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We employed a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach using TCF7L2 variant rs7903146 as an instrument for lifelong levels of -cell function. We first conducted two sets of meta-analyses to quantify the association of the TCF7L2 variant with the risk of type 2 diabetes among 55 436 cases and 106 020 controls from 66 studies by calculating pooled odds ratio (OR) and to quantify the associations with multiple direct or indirect measures of -cell function among 35 052 non-diabetic individuals from 31 studies by calculating pooled mean difference. We further applied the method of MR to obtain the causal estimates for the effect of -cell function on type 2 diabetes risk based on findings from the meta-analyses. The OR [95 confidence interval (CI)] was 0.87 (0.810.93) for each five unit increment in homeostasis model assessment of insulin secretion (HOMA-B) (P 3.0 10(5)). In addition, for measures based on intravenous glucose tolerance test, ORs (95 CI) associated with type 2 diabetes risk were 0.24 (0.080.74) (P 0.01) and 0.14 (0.040.48) (P 0.002) for per 1 standard deviation increment in insulin sensitivity index and disposition index, respectively. Findings from the present study lend support to a causal role of pancreatic -cell function itself in the etiology of type 2 diabetes.

J	McCandless, LC				McCandless, Lawrence C.			Statin Use and Fracture Risk <i>Can We Quantify the Healthy-User Effect</i>?	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							COA REDUCTASE INHIBITORS; HIP-FRACTURES; BIAS; METAANALYSIS; ADJUSTMENT; ADHERENCE; THERAPY; DENSITY	Background: Numerous observational studies show that statin use is associated with lower risk of osteoporotic fractures. However, a causal relationship is not supported by data from randomized trials. Unmeasured confounding is implicated as a likely culprit for the controversy because of failure to measure and adjust for patient-level tendencies to engage in healthy behaviors. However, an alternative explanation is selection bias because of the inclusion of prevalent users of statins in the analysis. The relative importance of either bias has not been investigated in a quantitative sensitivity analysis. Methods: We conducted a systematic review to summarize the pattern of association between statin use and fracture risk in observational studies. Our objective was to quantify the magnitude of unmeasured confounding and selection bias in a sensitivity analysis. Results: In 17 published studies, the pooled relative risk for the association between current use of statins and fracture risk was 0.75 (95% confidence interval = 0.66-0.85). Upon adjustment for individual-level use of preventative health services, the pooled relative risk shifted by less than 5% on the log scale. However, a sensitivity analysis for selection bias revealed that moderate levels of bias could eliminate the association between statins and fracture risk. Conclusions: It appears that confounding from unmeasured variables cannot explain the protective association between statins and fractures that has been observed in the literature.

Marriage and reductions in men's alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Alcohol; cannabis; marriage; quasi-causal inference; tobacco	NATIONAL EPIDEMIOLOGIC SURVEY; SUBSTANCE USE; USE DISORDER; NICOTINE DEPENDENCE; DRINKING; ADOLESCENCE; TRANSITIONS; MARIJUANA; SELECTION; SMOKING	Background Psychoactive substance use is lower among married compared to divorced or unmarried men; yet, the nature of this effect remains unclear because becoming and staying married is potentially confounded with substance-related background familial and individual factors, like parental divorce and personality. The authors investigated the associations between marital status and substance use; how substance use changed across the transition to marriage; and whether marriage effects were likely to be causal. Method The sample included 1790 adults from male-male twin pairs from a population-based registry. Measures of marital status and alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis use came from Life History Calendars. Data were analyzed using regression, co-twin comparison, and within-person models. The latter models are tools for quasi-causal inference that control for familial and individual-level confounders. Results Married men used less alcohol, tobacco, and cannabis than men who were divorced/separated or single. In analyses of substance use across the transition to marriage, men reduced their alcohol and cannabis use both before and after marriage, but their tobacco use only after marriage. These effects were largely robust in co-twin and within-person analyses. Conclusions Marriage was associated with substantial reductions in substance use compared to being divorced/separated or single, and these reductions began prior to marriage. The co-twin comparison and within-person models ruled out the alternative explanation that marriage effects were due to confounding background familial and individual factors. These results provide strong evidence that the social role expectations associated with marriage reduce psychoactive substance use.

Prior studies around the relationship between smoking and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity have reported inconsistent findings, which may be ascribed to heterogeneous study designs or biases in statistical analyses. We examined the association between smoking and RA outcomes using statistical methods that account for time-varying confounding and loss to followup. Methods. We included 282 individuals with an RA diagnosis using electronic health record data collected at a public hospital between 2013 and 2017. Current smoking status and disease activity were assessed at each visit; covariates included sex, race/ethnicity, age, obesity, and medication use. We used longitudinal targeted maximum likelihood estimation to estimate the causal effect of smoking on disease activity measures at 27 months, and compared results to conventional longitudinal methods. Results. Smoking was associated with an increase of 0.64 units in the patient global score compared to nonsmoking (p = 0.01), and with 2.58 more swollen joints (p < 0.001). While smoking was associated with a higher clinical disease activity score (2.11), the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.22). We found no association between smoking and physician global score, or C-reactive protein levels, and an inverse association between smoking and tender joint count (p = 0.05). Analyses using conventional methods showed a null relationship for all outcomes. Conclusion. Smoking is associated with higher levels of disease activity in RA. Causal methods may be useful for investigations of additional exposures on longitudinal outcome measures in rheumatologic disease.

J	NUZHDIN, SV; FRY, JD; MACKAY, TFC				NUZHDIN, SV; FRY, JD; MACKAY, TFC			POLYGENIC MUTATION IN DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER - THE CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP OF BRISTLE NUMBER TO FITNESS	GENETICS			English	Article							QUANTITATIVE TRAITS; STABILIZING SELECTION; PLEIOTROPIC MODELS; BALANCE	The association between sternopleural and abdominal bristle number and fitness in Drosophila melanogaster was determined for sublines of an initially highly inbred strain that were maintained by divergent artificial selection for 150 generations or by random mating for 180 generations. Replicate selection lines had more extreme bristle numbers than those that were maintained without artificial selection at the same census size for approximately the same number of generations. The average fitness, estimated by a single generation of competition against a compound autosome strain, was 0.17 for lines selected for high and low abdominal bristle numbers and 0.19 for lines selected for high and low sternopleural bristle number. The average fitness of unselected lines, 0.46, was significantly higher than that of the selection lines. The fitnesses and the relationships of bristle number to fitness in progeny of all possible crosses of high x high (H x H), high x low (H x L) and low x low (L x L) selection lines were examined to determine whether the observed intermediate optima were caused by direct stabilizing selection on bristle number or by apparent stabilizing selection mediated through deleterious pleiotropic fitness effects of mutations affecting bristle number. Although bristle number was nearly additive for progeny of H x H, H x L and L x L crosses among sternopleural bristle selection lines, their mean fitnesses were not significantly different from each other, or from the mean fitness of the unselected lines, suggesting partly or completely recessive pleiotropic fitness effects cause apparent stabilizing selection. The average fitness of the progeny of H X H abdominal bristle selection lines was not significantly different from the fitness of unselected lines, but the mean fitness of the progeny of L x L crosses was not significantly different from that of the pure low lines. This is consistent with direct selection against low but not high abdominal bristle number, but the interpretation is confounded by variation in average degree of dominance for fitness (on average recessive in the high abdominal bristle selection lines and additive in the low abdominal bristle selection lines). Neither direct stabilizing selection nor pleiotropy, therefore, can account for all the observations.

Our work is motivated by challenges that occur in environmental epidemiology, where the usual presence of several confounding variables that exhibit complex interactions and high correlations makes it difficult to estimate and understand the effects of risk factors on health outcomes of interest. The modelling approach that we adopt assumes that responses and confounding variables are manifestations of continuous latent variables and uses multivariate Gaussian distributions to model these jointly. Responses and confounding variables are not treated equally as relevant parameters of the distributions of the responses only are modelled in terms of explanatory variables or risk factors. Spatial dependence is introduced by allowing the weights of the non-parametric process priors to be location specific, obtained as probit transformations of Gaussian Markov random fields. Confounding variables and spatial configuration have a similar role in the model, in that they influence, along with the responses, only the allocation probabilities of the areas into the mixture components, thereby allowing for flexible adjustment of the effects of observed confounders, while allowing for the possibility of residual spatial structure, possibly occurring because of unmeasured or undiscovered spatially varying factors. Aspects of the model are illustrated in simulation studies and an application to a real data set.

This study is aimed at assessing confounding in these associations using negative control exposures. Methods: This nested case-control study included all children diagnosed with ASD (detected through 31 December 2016) born during 2007-2012 in Israel and residing in the study area (N = 3,843), and matched controls of the same age (N = 38,430). We assigned individual house-level exposure estimates for each child. We estimated associations using logistic regression models, mutually adjusted for all relevant exposure periods (prepregnancy, pregnancy, and postnatal). We assessed residual confounding using postoutcome negative control exposure at age 28-36 months. Results: In mutually adjusted models, we observed positive associations with ASD for postnatal exposures to NOx (odds ratio per interquartile range, 95% confidence interval: 1.19, 1.02-1.38) and NO2 (1.20, 1.00-1.43)(,) and gestational exposure to PM2.5-10 (1.08, 1.01-1.15). The result for the negative control period was 1.04, 0.99-1.10 for PM2.5, suggesting some residual confounding, but no associations for PM2.5-10 (0.98, 0.81-1.18), NOx (1.02, 0.84-1.25), or NO2 (0.98, 0.81-1.18), suggesting no residual confounding. Conclusions: Our results further support a hypothesized causal link with ASD that is specific to postnatal exposures to traffic-related pollution.

Methodological challenges and proposed solutions for evaluating opioid policy effectiveness	HEALTH SERVICES AND OUTCOMES RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Opioid policy; Statistical methodology; Data quality; Treatment heterogeneity; Selection bias	DRUG-MONITORING PROGRAMS; MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCES; CAUSAL INFERENCE; PROBABILITY WEIGHTS; UNITED-STATES; LAWS; MORTALITY; ACCESS; POWER	Opioid-related mortality increased by nearly 400% between 2000 and 2018. In response, federal, state, and local governments have enacted a heterogeneous collection of opioid-related policies in an effort to reverse the opioid crisis, producing a policy landscape that is both complex and dynamic. Correspondingly, there has been a rise in opioid-policy related evaluation studies, as policymakers and other stakeholders seek to understand which policies are most effective. In this paper, we provide an overview of methodological challenges facing opioid policy researchers when conducting opioid policy evaluation studies using observational data, as well as some potential solutions to those challenges. In particular, we discuss the following key challenges: (1) Obtaining high-quality opioid policy data; (2) Appropriately operationalizing and specifying opioid policies; (3) Obtaining high-quality opioid outcome data; (4) Addressing confounding due to systematic differences between policy and non-policy states; (5) Identifying heterogeneous policy effects across states, population subgroups, and time; (6) Disentangling effects of concurrent policies; and (7) Overcoming limited statistical power to detect policy effects afforded by commonly-used methods. We discuss each of these challenges and propose some ways forward to address them. Increasing the methodological rigor of opioid evaluation studies is imperative to identifying and implementing opioid policies that are most effective at reducing opioid-related harms.

Associations between neighbourhood characteristics and depression: a twin study	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article						depression; twins; genetics; social inequalities; neighborhood; place	INCOME INEQUALITY; MORTALITY; HEALTH; DISORDER; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; ENVIRONMENT; SYMPTOMS; CHOICE; CAUSAL; FAMILY	Background Depression is an important contributor to the global burden of disease. Besides several known individual-level factors that contribute to depression, there is a growing recognition that neighbourhood environment can also profoundly affect mental health. This study assessed associations between three neighbourhood constructssocioeconomic deprivation, residential instability and income inequalityand depression among adult twin pairs. The twin design is used to examine the association between neighbourhood constructs and depression, controlling for selection factors (ie, genetic and shared environmental factors) that have confounded purported associations. Methods We used multilevel random-intercept Poisson regression among 3738 same-sex twin pairs from a community-based twin registry to examine the association between neighbourhood constructs and depression. The within-pair association controls for confounding by genetic and environmental factors shared between twins within a pair, and is the main parameter of interest. Models were adjusted for individual-level income, education and marital status, and further by neighbourhood-level population density. Results When twins were analysed as individuals (phenotypic model), all neighbourhood constructs were significantly associated with depression. However, only neighbourhood socioeconomic deprivation showed a significant within-pair association with depression. A 10-unit within-pair difference in neighbourhood socioeconomic deprivation was associated with 6% greater depressive symptoms (1.06, 95%CI 1.01 to 1.11); the association did not substantially change in adjusted models. Conclusion This study provides new evidence linking neighbourhood socioeconomic deprivation with greater depression. Future studies should employ longitudinal designs to better test social causation versus social selection.

Studies estimating the effect of chemotherapy in colon cancer (CC) patients, however, often lacked information on pertinent comorbidities and functional status (FS). We assessed to what extent comorbidities and FS impact treatment decisions in colorectal cancer patients and explain the benefit of chemotherapy in stage III CC patients. Methods: Stage II-III colorectal cancer patients diagnosed in 2003-2014 and recruited into a population-based study were included (N=1102). Associations of comorbidity and FS with treatment patterns were examined with multivariable logistic regression. The contribution of lower comorbidity and higher FS to the benefit of chemotherapy was estimated with propensity score weighted Cox models in 430 stage III CC patients who were followed over a median time of 4.7 years. Results: In stage II (high-risk) and III CC patients, Charlson comorbidity scores 1, 2 and 3+ were associated with 57%, 66% and 70% lower odds of chemotherapy use, respectively. In combination with older age and poor FS, comorbidity was associated with 97% and 83% decreased odds of adjuvant chemotherapy use in CC and rectal cancer patients, respectively. In stage III CC patients, lower comorbidity and higher FS explained 38% and 24% of the overall and disease-specific survival benefits of chemotherapy, respectively. Selection bias was observed even in the comprehensive models, as chemotherapy was still associated with substantially higher non-disease-specific survival (hazard ratio (HR): 0.66; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.46-0.92), especially in patients <75 years (HR: 0.33; 95% CI: 0.17-0.63). Conclusion: Lower comorbidity and higher FS of recipients of chemotherapy explain approximately 40% of the benefits of chemotherapy in stage III CC patients. Regardless of how comprehensive propensity score analyses might be in observational studies, treatment selection bias might persist and affect estimates of treatment effects.

J	Zahl, PH; Aalen, OO				Zahl, PH; Aalen, OO			Adjusting and comparing survival curves by means of an additive risk model	LIFETIME DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Aalen's additive regression model; adjusted survival curves; relative survival; malignant melanoma	REGRESSION-MODEL; EXPECTED SURVIVAL; EXCESS; INTENSITIES; MORTALITY; CANCER; RATES	Survival curves may be adjusted for covariates using Aalen's additive risk model. Survival curves may be compared by taking the ratio of two adjusted survival curves; the ratio is denoted the generalized relative survival rate. Adjusting both survival curves for all but one of a common set of covariates gives the partial relative survival rate, which measures the covariate-specific contribution to the generalized relative survival rate. The generalized and partial relative survival rates have interpretations similar to the traditional relative survival rates frequently used in cancer epidemiology. In fact, the traditional relative survival rate can be generalized to a regression context using the additive risk model.

Marginal structural Cox models (MSCMs) can provide distinct advantages over traditional approaches by allowing adjustment for time-varying confounders such as MS relapses, as well as baseline characteristics, through the use of inverse probability weighting. We assessed the suitability of MSCMs to analyze data from a large cohort of 1,697 relapsing-remitting MS patients in British Columbia, Canada (1995-2008). In the context of this observational study, which spanned more than a decade and involved patients with a chronic yet fluctuating disease, the recently proposed "normalized stabilized" weights were found to be the most appropriate choice of weights. Using this model, no association between beta-interferon exposure and the hazard of disability progression was found (hazard ratio = 1.36, 95% confidence interval: 0.95, 1.94). For sensitivity analyses, truncated normalized unstabilized weights were used in additional MSCMs and to construct inverse probability weight-adjusted survival curves; the findings did not change. Additionally, qualitatively similar conclusions from approximation approaches to the weighted Cox model (i.e., MSCM) extend confidence in the findings.

DAGs are constructed to depict prior knowledge about biological and behavioral systems related to specific causal research questions. DAG components portray who receives treatment or experiences exposures; mechanisms by which treatments and exposures operate; and other factors that influence the outcome of interest or which persons are included in an analysis. Once assembled, DAGs - via a few simple rules - guide the researcher in identifying whether the causal effect of interest can be identified without bias and, if so, what must be done either in study design or data analysis to achieve this. Specifically, DAGs can identify variables that, if controlled for in the design or analysis phase, are sufficient to eliminate confounding and some forms of selection bias. DAGs also help recognize variables that, if controlled for, bias the analysis (e.g., mediators or factors influenced by both exposure and outcome). Finally, DAGs help researchers recognize insidious sources of bias introduced by selection of individuals into studies or failure to completely observe all individuals until study outcomes are reached. DAGs, however, are not infallible, largely owing to limitations in prior knowledge about the system in question. In such instances, several alternative DAGs are plausible, and researchers should assess whether results differ meaningfully across analyses guided by different DAGs and be forthright about uncertainty. DAGs are powerful tools to guide the conduct of clinical research. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

PROMMTT Study Grp	Statistical Machines for Trauma Hospital Outcomes Research: Application to the PRospective, Observational, Multi-Center Major Trauma Transfusion (PROMMTT) Study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MASSIVE TRANSFUSION; PROPENSITY SCORE; MORTALITY; BENEFITS; TRIGGERS	Improving the treatment of trauma, a leading cause of death worldwide, is of great clinical and public health interest. This analysis introduces flexible statistical methods for estimating center-level effects on individual outcomes in the context of highly variable patient populations, such as those of the PRospective, Observational, Multi-center Major Trauma Transfusion study. Ten US level I trauma centers enrolled a total of 1,245 trauma patients who survived at least 30 minutes after admission and received at least one unit of red blood cells. Outcomes included death, multiple organ failure, substantial bleeding, and transfusion of blood products. The centers involved were classified as either large or small-volume based on the number of massive transfusion patients enrolled during the study period. We focused on estimation of parameters inspired by causal inference, specifically estimated impacts on patient outcomes related to the volume of the trauma hospital that treated them. We defined this association as the change in mean outcomes of interest that would be observed if, contrary to fact, subjects from large-volume sites were treated at small-volume sites (the effect of treatment among the treated). We estimated this parameter using three different methods, some of which use data-adaptive machine learning tools to derive the outcome models, minimizing residual confounding by reducing model misspecification. Differences between unadjusted and adjusted estimators sometimes differed dramatically, demonstrating the need to account for differences in patient characteristics in clinic comparisons. In addition, the estimators based on robust adjustment methods showed potential impacts of hospital volume. For instance, we estimated a survival benefit for patients who were treated at large-volume sites, which was not apparent in simpler, unadjusted comparisons. By removing arbitrary modeling decisions from the estimation process and concentrating on parameters that have more direct policy implications, these potentially automated approaches allow methodological standardization across similar comparativeness effectiveness studies.

J	Hwang, H; Quiroz, JC; Gallego, B				Hwang, Hon; Quiroz, Juan C.; Gallego, Blanca			Assessing the effectiveness of empirical calibration under different bias scenarios	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Bias; Confounding; Empirical calibration; Negative controls; Positive controls; Simulations	PROPENSITY SCORE	Background Estimations of causal effects from observational data are subject to various sources of bias. One method for adjusting for the residual biases in the estimation of treatment effects is through the use of negative control outcomes, which are outcomes not believed to be affected by the treatment of interest. The empirical calibration procedure is a technique that uses negative control outcomes to calibrate p-values. An extension of this technique calibrates the coverage of the 95% confidence interval of a treatment effect estimate by using negative control outcomes as well as positive control outcomes, which are outcomes for which the treatment of interest has known effects. Although empirical calibration has been used in several large observational studies, there is no systematic examination of its effect under different bias scenarios. Methods The effect of empirical calibration of confidence intervals was analyzed using simulated datasets with known treatment effects. The simulations consisted of binary treatment and binary outcome, with biases resulting from unmeasured confounder, model misspecification, measurement error, and lack of positivity. The performance of the empirical calibration was evaluated by determining the change in the coverage of the confidence interval and the bias in the treatment effect estimate. Results Empirical calibration increased coverage of the 95% confidence interval of the treatment effect estimate under most bias scenarios but was inconsistent in adjusting the bias in the treatment effect estimate. Empirical calibration of confidence intervals was most effective when adjusting for the unmeasured confounding bias. Suitable negative controls had a large impact on the adjustment made by empirical calibration, but small improvements in the coverage of the outcome of interest were also observable when using unsuitable negative controls. Conclusions This work adds evidence to the efficacy of empirical calibration of the confidence intervals in observational studies. Calibration of confidence intervals is most effective where there are biases due to unmeasured confounding. Further research is needed on the selection of suitable negative controls.

A variety of model formulations for the latent level have been proposed but all come with inherent issues. In the classical BYM (Besag, York and Mollie) model, the spatially structured component cannot be seen independently from the unstructured component. This makes prior definitions for the hyperparameters of the two random effects challenging. There are alternative model formulations that address this confounding; however, the issue on how to choose interpretable hyperpriors is still unsolved. Here, we discuss a recently proposed parameterisation of the BYM model that leads to improved parameter control as the hyperparameters can be seen independently from each other. Furthermore, the need for a scaled spatial component is addressed, which facilitates assignment of interpretable hyperpriors and make these transferable between spatial applications with different graph structures. The hyperparameters themselves are used to define flexible extensions of simple base models. Consequently, penalised complexity priors for these parameters can be derived based on the information-theoretic distance from the flexible model to the base model, giving priors with clear interpretation. We provide implementation details for the new model formulation which preserve sparsity properties, and we investigate systematically the model performance and compare it to existing parameterisations. Through a simulation study, we show that the new model performs well, both showing good learning abilities and good shrinkage behaviour. In terms of model choice criteria, the proposed model performs at least equally well as existing parameterisations, but only the new formulation offers parameters that are interpretable and hyperpriors that have a clear meaning.

Since this polymorphism is distributed randomly during gamete formation, its association with stroke should not be biased or confounded. We investigated consistency between the expected odds ratio for stroke among TT homozygotes, extrapolated from genotype-phenotype and phenotype-disease studies, and the observed odds ratio from a meta-analysis of genotype-disease association studies. Methods We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE up to June, 2003, for all relevant studies on the association between homocysteine concentration and the MTHFR polymorphism, and until December, 2003, for those on the association between the polymorphism and the risk of stroke. Pooled odds ratios and 95% CI were calculated by random-effects and fixed-effects models. Consistency between expected and observed odds ratios was assessed by interaction test. Findings 111 studies met the selection criteria. Among 15 635 people without cardiovascular disease, the weighted mean difference in homocysteine concentration between TT and CC homozygotes was 1.93 mumol/L (95% CI 1.38 to 2.47). The expected odds ratio for stroke corresponding to this difference based on previous observational studies was 1.20 (1.10 to 1.31). In our genetic meta-analysis (n=13 928) the odds ratio for stroke was 1.26 (1.14 to 1.40) for IT versus CC homozygotes, similar to the expected odds ratio (p=0.29). Consistency between the odds ratios was preserved in analyses by age-group, ethnic background, and geographical location. Interpretation The observed increase in risk of stroke among individuals homozygous for the MTHFR T allele is close to that predicted from the differences in homocysteine concentration conferred by this variant. This concordance is consistent with a causal relation between homocysteine concentration and stroke.

Although several studies have addressed the prevalence and incidence of ALS, there is a high heterogeneity in their results. Besides this, neither concept has been previously studied in PLS or PMA. Thus, the objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence and incidence of MND, (distinguishing ALS, PLS and PMA), in the Spanish regions of Catalonia and Valencia in the period 2011-2019. Two population-based Spanish cohorts were used, one from Catalonia and the other from Valencia. Given that the samples that comprised both cohorts were not random, i.e., leading to a selection bias, we used a two-part model in which both the individual and contextual observed and unobserved confounding variables are controlled for, along with the spatial and temporal dependence. The prevalence of MND was estimated to be between 3.990 and 6.334 per 100,000 inhabitants (ALS between 3.248 and 5.120; PMA between 0.065 and 0.634; and PLS between 0.046 and 1.896), and the incidence between 1.682 and 2.165 per 100,000 person-years for MND (ALS between 1.351 and 1.754; PMA between 0.225 and 0.628; and PLS between 0.409-0.544). Results were similar in the two regions and did not differ from those previously reported for ALS, suggesting that the proposed method is robust and that neither region presents differential risk or protective factors.

Design A 25-year longitudinal study of the health, development and adjustment of a birth cohort of 1265 New Zealand children. Measurements Annual assessments of the frequency of cannabis use were obtained for the period 14-25 years, together with measures of the use of other illicit drugs from the same time period. Findings The frequency of cannabis use was associated significantly with the use of other illicit drugs, other illicit drug abuse/dependence and the use of a diversity of other drugs. This association was found to be particularly strong during adolescence but declined rapidly as age increased. Statistical control for confounding by both fixed and time dynamic factors using random- and fixed-effects regression models reduced the strength of association between frequency of cannabis use and other illicit drug use, but a strong association between frequency of cannabis use and other illicit drug use remained even after control for non-observed and time-dynamic sources of confounding. Conclusions Regular or heavy cannabis use was associated with an increased risk of using other illicit drugs, abusing or becoming dependent upon other illicit drugs, and using a wider variety of other illicit drugs. The risks of use, abuse/dependence, and use of a diversity of other drugs declined with increasing age. The findings may support a general causal model such as the cannabis gateway hypothesis, but the actual causal mechanisms underlying such a gateway, and the extent to which these causal mechanisms are direct or indirect, remain unclear.

However, they have not been previously adapted to deal with bias in genetic association studies. We propose an extension of our previous method (Zhao et al., 2009) that uses a multilevel propensity score approach and allows one to estimate the effect of a genotype under an additive model and also simultaneously adjusts for confounders such as genetic ancestry and patient and disease characteristics. Using simulation studies, we demonstrate that this extended genetic propensity score (eGPS) can adequately adjust and consistently correct for bias due to confounding in a variety of circumstances. Under all simulation scenarios, the eGPS method yields estimates with bias close to 0 (mean=0.018, standard error=0.01). Our method also preserves statistical properties such as coverage probability, Type I error, and power. We illustrate this approach in a population-based genetic association study of testicular germ cell tumors and KITLG and SPRY4 susceptibility genes. We conclude that our method provides a novel and broadly applicable analytic strategy for obtaining less biased and more valid estimates of genetic associations.

Objectives: We aim to replicate earlier findings of limited VAP-attributable ICU mortality in an independent cohort. By refining statistical analyses, we gradually tackle different sources of bias. Methods: Records of 2,720 adult patients admitted to Ghent University Hospital ICUs (2013-2017) and receiving mechanical ventilation within 48 hours after admission were extracted from linked Intensive Care Information System and Computerbased Surveillance and Alerting of Nosocomial Infections, Antimicrobial Resistance, and Antibiotic Consumption in the ICU databases. The VAP-attributable fraction of ICU mortality was estimated using a competing risk analysis that is restricted to VAP-free patients (approach 1), accounts for VAP onset by treating it as either a competing (approach 2) or censoring event approach 3), or additionally adjusts for time-dependent confounding via inverse probability weighting (approach 4). Results: A total of 210 patients (7.7%) acquired VAP. Based on benchmark approach 4, we estimated that (compared with current preventive measures) hypothetical eradication of VAP would lead to a relative ICU mortality reduction of 1.7% (95% confidence interval, 21.3 to 4.6) by Day 10 and of 3.6% (95% confidence interval, 0.7 to 6.5) by Day 60. Approaches 1-3 produced estimates ranging from 20.7% to 2.5% by Day 10 and from 5.2% to 5.5% by Day 60. Conclusions: In line with previous studies using appropriate methodology, we found limited VAP-attributable ICU mortality given current state-of-the-art VAP prevention measures. Our study illustrates that inappropriate accounting of the time dependency of exposure and confounding of its effects may misleadingly suggest protective effects of early-onset VAP and systematically overestimate attributable mortality.

Behind the Numbers: Propensity Score Analysis-A Primer for the Diagnostic Radiologist	RADIOLOGY			English	Article							VARIABLE SELECTION; MISSING DATA; MODELS; BIAS; CAUSAL	Researchers frequently use observational studies to compare outcomes of patients who undergo different treatments. However, as patients in these observational studies are not randomly assigned to a particular treatment group, unknown confounding variables may be present. Specifically, there may be major differences in numerous clinical variables between the treatment groups that may affect the outcomes being examined. Propensity score adjustment is an increasingly popular statistical method used to simultaneously balance these clinical variables and control for this confounder bias. Propensity score analysis can minimize the limitations of retrospective or prospective observational studies by simulating the randomization process of randomized controlled trials. In this review, an introduction to propensity score adjustment is provided by using the Takuma et al study published in this issue of Radiology as an example.

The principles of MR are based on Mendel's laws of inheritance and instrumental variable estimation methods, which enable the inference of causal effects in the presence of unobserved confounding. In this Primer, we outline the principles of MR, the instrumental variable conditions underlying MR estimation and some of the methods used for estimation. We go on to discuss how the assumptions underlying an MR study can be assessed and describe methods of estimation that are robust to certain violations of these assumptions. We give examples of a range of studies in which MR has been applied, the limitations of current methods of analysis and the outlook for MR in the future. The differences between the assumptions required for MR analysis and other forms of epidemiological studies means that MR can be used as part of a triangulation across multiple sources of evidence for causal inference.

Variance estimation for stratified propensity score estimators	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						confounding; inverse probability weighting; observational study	CAUSAL INFERENCE; SELECTION; DIET	Propensity score methods are increasingly used to estimate the effect of a treatment or exposure on an outcome in non-randomised studies. We focus on one such method, stratification on the propensity score, comparing it with the method of inverse-probability weighting by the propensity score. The propensity scorethe conditional probability of receiving the treatment given observed covariatesis usually an unknown probability estimated from the data. Estimators for the variance of treatment effect estimates typically used in practice, however, do not take into account that the propensity score itself has been estimated from the data. By deriving the asymptotic marginal variance of the stratified estimate of treatment effect, correctly taking into account the estimation of the propensity score, we show that routinely used variance estimators are likely to produce confidence intervals that are too conservative when the propensity score model includes variables that predict (cause) the outcome, but only weakly predict the treatment. In contrast, a comparison with the analogous marginal variance for the inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimator shows that routinely used variance estimators for the IPW estimator are likely to produce confidence intervals that are almost always too conservative. Because exact calculation of the asymptotic marginal variance is likely to be complex, particularly for the stratified estimator, we suggest that bootstrap estimates of variance should be used in practice.

Unfortunately, incomplete adherence is a common problem in pragmatic trials. The commonly used methods in randomized control trials often cannot handle the added complexity imposed by incomplete adherence, resulting in biased estimates. Several naive methods and advanced causal inference methods (e.g., inverse probability weighting and instrumental variable-based approaches) have been used in the literature to deal with incomplete adherence. Practitioners and applied researchers are often confused about which method to consider under a given setting. This current work is aimed to review commonly used statistical methods to deal with non-adherence along with their key assumptions, advantages, and limitations, with a particular focus on pragmatic trials. We have listed the applicable settings for these methods and provided a summary of available software. All methods were applied to two hypothetical datasets to demonstrate how these methods perform in a given scenario, along with the R codes. The key considerations include the type of intervention strategy (point treatment settings, where treatment is administered only once versus sustained treatment settings, where treatment has to be continued over time) and availability of data (e.g., the extent of measured or unmeasured covariates that are associated with adherence, dependent confounding impacted by past treatment, and potential violation of assumptions). This study will guide practitioners and applied researchers to use the appropriate statistical method to address incomplete adherence in pragmatic trial settings for both the point and sustained treatment strategies.

Such models may also include gene-environment interaction terms that allow the genotypes to modify the effect of the exposure, or equivalently, the exposure to modify the effect of genotypes on the relative risk. When a measured test locus is in linkage disequilibrium with an unmeasured causal locus, exposure-related genetic structure in the population can lead to spurious gene-environment interaction; that is, to apparent gene-environment interaction at the test locus in the absence of true gene-environment interaction at the causal locus. Exposure-related genetic structure occurs when the distributions of exposures and of haplotypes at the test and causal locus both differ across population strata. A case-parent trio design can protect inference of genetic main effects from confounding bias due to genetic structure in the population. Unfortunately, when the genetic structure is exposure-related, the protection against confounding bias for the genetic main effect does not extend to the gene-environment interaction term.Methods: We show that current methods to reduce the bias in estimated gene-environment interactions from case-parent trio data can only account for simple population structure involving two strata. To fill this gap, we propose to directly accommodate multiple population strata by adjusting for genetic principal components (PCs).Results and Discussion: Through simulations, we show that our PC adjustment maintains the nominal type-1 error rate and has nearly identical power to detect gene-environment interaction as an oracle approach based directly on population strata. We also apply the PC-adjustment approach to data from a study of genetic modifiers of cleft palate comprised primarily of case-parent trios of European and East Asian ancestry. Consistent with earlier analyses, our results suggest that the gene-environment interaction signal in these data is due to the self-reported European trios.

J	Sjölander, A; Öberg, S; Frisell, T				Sjolander, Arvid; Oberg, Sara; Frisell, Thomas			Generalizability and effect measure modification in sibling comparison studies	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Bias; Causal inference; Effect measure modification; Sibling comparison study	CLUSTER	Sibling comparison studies have the attractive feature of being able to control for unmeasured confounding by factors that are shared within families. However, there is sometimes a concern that these studies may have poor generalizability (external validity) due to the implicit restriction to families that are covariate-discordant, i.e., those families where at least two siblings have different levels of at least one of the covariates (exposure or confounders) under investigation. Even if this selection mechanism has been noted by many authors, previous accounts of the problem tend to be brief. The purpose of this paper is to provide a formal discussion of the implicit restriction to covariate-discordant families in sibling comparison studies. We discuss when and how this restriction may impair the generalizability of the study, and we show that a similar generalizability problem may in fact arise even when all families are covariate-discordant, e.g. even if the exposure is continuous so that all siblings have different exposure levels. We show how this problem can be solved by using a so-called marginal between-within model for estimation of marginal exposure effects. Finally, we illustrate the theoretical conclusions with a simulation study.

The exposure-crossover design is a new method for studying sustained changes in recurrent events	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Crossover studies; Epidemiologic research designs; Evaluation studies as topic; Self-matched analysis; Outcome and process assessment; Comparative effectiveness research; Statistics methods; Minimization of bias	LONGITUDINAL DATA; CLINICAL-TRIALS; HEART-FAILURE; AIR-POLLUTION; SAMPLE-SIZE; RISK; REGRESSION; POPULATION; COHORT; TIME	Objectives: To introduce a new design that explores how an acute exposure might lead to a sustained change in the risk of a recurrent outcome. Study Design and Setting: The exposure-crossover design uses self-matching to control within-person confounding due to genetics, personality, and all other stable patient characteristics. The design is demonstrated using population-based individual-level health data from Ontario, Canada, for three separate medical conditions (n > 100,000 for each) related to the risk of a motor vehicle crash (total outcomes, >2,000 for each). Results: The exposure-crossover design yields numerical risk estimates during the baseline interval before an intervention, the induction interval immediately ahead of the intervention, and the subsequent interval after the intervention. Accompanying graphs summarize results, provide an intuitive display to readers, and show risk comparisons (absolute and relative). Self-matching increases statistical efficiency, reduces selection bias, and yields quantitative analyses. The design has potential limitations related to confounding, artifacts, pragmatics, survivor bias, statistical models, potential misunderstandings, and serendipity. Conclusion: The exposure-crossover design may help in exploring selected questions in epidemiology science. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The evaluation of complex treatment programmes for mental illness (e.g. cognitive-behavioural therapy for depression or psychosis) not only is a vital component of this research in its own right but also provides a well-established model for the evaluation of complex interventions in other clinical areas. In the context of efficacy and mechanism evaluation (EME) there is a particular need for robust methods for making valid causal inference in explanatory analyses of the mechanisms of treatment-induced change in clinical outcomes in randomised clinical trials. Objectives: The key objective was to produce statistical methods to enable trial investigators to make valid causal inferences about the mechanisms of treatment-induced change in these clinical outcomes. The primary objective of this report is to disseminate this methodology, aiming specifically at trial practitioners. Methods: The three components of the research were (1) the extension of instrumental variable (IV) methods to latent growth curve models and growth mixture models for repeated-measures data; (2) the development of designs and regression methods for parallel trials; and (3) the evaluation of the sensitivity/robustness of findings to the assumptions necessary for model identifiability. We illustrate our methods with applications from psychological and psychosocial intervention trials, keeping the technical details to a minimum, leaving the reporting of the more theoretical and mathematically demanding results for publication in appropriate specialist journals. Results: We show how to estimate treatment effects and introduce methods for EME. We explain the use of IV methods and principal stratification to evaluate the role of putative treatment effect mediators and therapeutic process measures. These results are extended to the analysis of longitudinal data structures. We consider the design of EME trials. We focus on designs to create convincing IVs, bearing in mind assumptions needed to attain model identifiability. A key area of application that has become apparent during this work is the potential role of treatment moderators (predictive markers) in the evaluation of treatment effect mechanisms for personalised therapies (stratified medicine). We consider the role of targeted therapies and multiarm trials and the use of parallel trials to help elucidate the evaluation of mediators working in parallel. Conclusions: In order to demonstrate both efficacy and mechanism, it is necessary to (1) demonstrate a treatment effect on the primary (clinical) outcome, (2) demonstrate a treatment effect on the putative mediator (mechanism) and (3) demonstrate a causal effect from the mediator to the outcome. Appropriate regression models should be applied for (3) or alternative IV procedures, which account for unmeasured confounding, provided that a valid instrument can be identified. Stratified medicine may provide a setting where such instruments can be designed into the trial. This work could be extended by considering improved trial designs, sample size considerations and measurement properties.

When analyzing such "time-to-event" data, survival analysis is superior to conventional statistical techniques because it can accommodate censored observations, i.e., cases in which the event has not occurred by the end of the study. Central to survival analysis are two mathematical functions, the survivor function, which describes the probability that an individual will "survive" (i.e., that the event will not occur) until a given point in time, and the hazard function, which gives the instantaneous risk that the event will occur at that time, given that it has not occurred previously. These functions can be compared among two or more groups using chi-square-based test statistics. The effects of discrete or continuous covariates on survival times can be quantified with two types of models, the accelerated failure time model and the proportional hazards model. When applied to longitudinal data on the timing of defoliation of individual blueberry leaves in the field, analysis with the accelerated failure time model revealed a significantly (P < 0.0001) increased defoliation risk due to Septoria leaf spot, caused by Septoria albopunctata. Defoliation occurred earlier for lower leaves than for upper leaves, but this effect was confounded in part with increased disease severity on lower leaves.

We consider the problem of causal inference regarding the effect modifying role of a biomarker, which is only available for some individuals in an observational study. We develop inverse probability weighted mean score estimating functions with one weight to account for confounding and a second weight for the missing data process. An iterative approach is described for solving the equations in the spirit of the expectation-maximization algorithm, and large sample properties of the resulting estimator are developed. Simulation studies are conducted to compare the proposed method with a doubly weighted complete case analysis and a propensity score weighted multiple imputation approach. An application to a study of the effect of a biologic therapy on inflammation in a rheumatology cohort is given for illustration.

J	Baker, J; Pearson, OM				Baker, J; Pearson, OM			Statistical methods for bioarchaeology: applications of age-adjustment and logistic regression to comparisons of skeletal populations with differing age-structures	JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						paleopathology; osteoarthritis; statistical methods; age-adjustment; logistic regression	OSTEOARTHRITIS; MORTALITY; DISEASE; STRESS; MODELS; JOINT	Previous studies of patterns of osteoarthritis involvement in prehistoric skeletal populations have been used to Suggest differences in lifestyle or Subsistence patterns. fit spite of the intriguing nature of such studies, inadequate controls for the potential confounding effects of age have made results less secure than they appear. While researchers remain unable to control for the inherent limitations imposed by preservation bias, meaningful advancement could be made in the analysis of these data. Here we propose two methods from epidemiology that Would allow more robust comparisons between populations with differing age-structures: age-adjustment and logistic regression. We apply these two methods to previously published data from prehistoric populations of the American Great Basin. In doing so, we are able to discern sex differences in risk for osteoarthritis at the shoulder (beta = -1.82, SE = 0.74, OR = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.04-0.69: p = 0.013), elbow (beta = -2.07 SE = 0.82 OR = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.03-0.63, p = 0.011), and in the foot (beta = -3.11 SE = 1.57, OR = 0.04, 95% CI 0.00-0.97, p = 0.048), that were not noted in previous analyses of these data. These findings suggest that greater clarity of results and more precise comparisons of risk may be achieved by using these methods. We conclude that further application of these methods to bioarchaeological studies would potentially improve what can be said about prehistoric health patterns and lifeways.

Facility-Level Variation and Clinical Outcomes in Use of Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy With and Without an Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator	CIRCULATION-CARDIOVASCULAR QUALITY AND OUTCOMES			English	Article						cardiac resynchronization therapy; comorbidity; defibrillators; heart failure; Medicare	TRENDS	BACKGROUND: Little is known about real-world facility-level preferences for cardiac resynchronization therapy devices with (CRT-D) and without (CRT-P) defibrillator backup. We quantify this variation at the facility level and exploit this variation to compare outcomes of patients receiving these 2 devices. METHODS AND RESULTS: Claims data from fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries were used to identify new CRT-P and CRT-D implants, 2006 to 2012. We modeled factors associated with receipt of each device, and compared mortality, hospitalizations, and reoperations for patients receiving each using both logistic regression and instrumental variable analysis to account for confounding. Among 71 459 device recipients (CRT-P, 11 925; CRT-D, 59 534; 31% women), CRT-P recipients were older, more likely to be women, and had more comorbidities. Variation in device selection among facilities was substantial: After adjustment for patient characteristics, the odds of receiving a CRT-P (versus CRT-D) device were 7.6x higher for a patient treated at a facility in the highest CRT-P use quartile versus a facility in the lowest CRT-P use quartile. Logistic modeling suggested a survival advantage for CRT-D devices but with falsification end points indicating residual confounding. By contrast, in the instrumental variable analysis using facility variability as the proposed instrument, clinical characteristics and falsification end points were well balanced, and 1-year mortality in patients who received CRT-P versus CRT-D implants did not differ, while CRT-P patients had a lower probability of hospitalizations and reoperations in the year following implant. CONCLUSIONS: CRT-P versus CRT-D selection varies substantially among facilities, adjusted for clinical factors. After instrumental variable adjustment for clinical covariates and facility preference, survival was no different between the devices. Therefore, CRT-P may be preferred for Medicare beneficiaries considering new CRT implantation.

It shows that the conditions for valid comparison depend on the type of measure used for comparison, that is, difference, ratio, or percent change, If the measure for comparison is a difference of the standardized rates at two time points, then the age-specific rates need to maintain a constant rate difference over time for the comparison to be valid. If the measure for comparison is a ratio or percent change of the standardized rates at two time points, then the age-specific rates need to maintain a constant rate ratio over time for the comparison to be valid. Since in reality, as shown by our Canadian empirical data, age-specific rates do not always maintain a consistent pattern over time, it is recommended that one should always stratify the data to look at patterns of age-specific rates before applying age standardization.

Particularly wealth, which is increasingly thought of as an important dimension of accumulated advantage, is only rarely examined as a confounder. Using eight waves of panel data from the English Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSA, 2002-19), we investigate the association between subjective SES and self-rated health. We use random effects models that account for theoretically important time-constant (such as education and social class) and time-varying confounders (such as income and wealth) as well as fixed-effects models, that in addition control for all time-constant confounders, whether observed or unobserved. The fully adjusted fixed-effects model reveals a statistically significant association between subjective SES and self-rated health. Yet, a one-point increase on the subjective SES ladder goes along with a two per cent of a standard deviation increase in self-rated health, only around a quarter of the size of the random-effects estimate. The role of wealth for the subjective SES-self-rated health association is negligible in the fixed-effects specifications. Smoking, drinking, and physical activity do not appear to mediate the association. A substantial part, though not all, of the observed association between subjective SES and self-rated health is due to unobserved confounding rather than a causal effect. Reducing health inequalities based on objective SES is likely more effective than based on subjective SES.

We give non-parametric identification results, discuss parametric implementation and also provide a weighting approach to direct and indirect effects based on combining the results of two marginal structural models. We also discuss how our results give rise to a causal interpretation of the effect estimates produced from longitudinal structural equation models. When there are time varying confounders affected by prior exposure and a mediator, natural direct and indirect effects are not identified. However, we define a randomized interventional analogue of natural direct and indirect effects that are identified in this setting. The formula that identifies these effects we refer to as the mediational g-formula'. When there is no mediation, the mediational g-formula reduces to Robins's regular g-formula for longitudinal data. When there are no time varying confounders affected by prior exposure and mediator values, then the mediational g-formula reduces to a longitudinal version of Pearl's mediation formula. However, the mediational g-formula itself can accommodate both mediation and time varying confounders and constitutes a general approach to mediation analysis with time varying exposures and mediators.

Testing Causality in Scientific Modelling Software	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Software testing; causal inference; causal testing	RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIALS; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; INFERENCE; STATISTICS; DIAGRAMS; DESIGN	From simulating galaxy formation to viral transmission in a pandemic, scientific models play a pivotal role in developing scientific theories and supporting government policy decisions that affect us all. Given these critical applications, a poor modelling assumption or bug could have far-reaching consequences. However, scientific models possess several properties that make them notoriously difficult to test, including a complex input space, long execution times, and non-determinism, rendering existing testing techniques impractical. In fields such as epidemiology, where researchers seek answers to challenging causal questions, a statistical methodology known as Causal inference has addressed similar problems, enabling the inference of causal conclusions from noisy, biased, and sparse data instead of costly experiments. This article introduces the causal testing framework: a framework that uses causal inference techniques to establish causal effects from existing data, enabling users to conduct software testing activities concerning the effect of a change, such as metamorphic testing, a posteriori. We present three case studies covering real-world scientific models, demonstrating how the causal testing framework can infer metamorphic test outcomes from reused, confounded test data to provide an efficient solution for testing scientific modelling software.

EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							GEOGRAPHIC LIFE ENVIRONMENTS; CARDIOVASCULAR MORTALITY; MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS; PRETERM BIRTH; RISK-FACTORS; OBESITY; HEALTH; MALMO; DISORDERS; SELECTION	Background: We investigated whether neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics, measured within person-centered areas (ie, centered on individuals' residences) are associated with body mass index (BMI [kg/m(2)]) and waist circumference. We used propensity-score matching as a diagnostic and validation tool to examine whether socio-spatial segregation (and related structural confounding) allowed us to estimate neighborhood socioeconomic effects adjusted for individual socioeconomic characteristics without excessive model extrapolations. Methods: Using the RECORD (Residential Environment and CORonary heart Disease) Cohort Study, we conducted cross-sectional analyses of 7230 adults from the Paris region. We first estimated the relationships of 3 neighborhood socioeconomic indicators (education, income, real estate prices) with BMI and waist circumference using traditional multilevel regression models adjusted for individual covariates. Second, we examined whether these associations persisted when estimated among participants exchangeable based on their probability of living in low-socioeconomic-status neighborhoods (propensity-score matched samples). Results: After adjustment for covariates, BMI/waist circumference increased with decreasing neighborhood socioeconomic status, especially with neighborhood education measured within 500-m radius buffers around residences; associations were stronger for women. With propensity-score matching techniques, there was some overlap in the odds of exposure between exposed and unexposed populations. As a function of socio-spatial segregation and an indicator of whether the data support inferences, sample size decreased by 17%-59% from the initial to the propensity-score matched samples. Propensity-score matched models confirmed relationships obtained from models in the entire sample. Conclusions: Overall, adjusted associations between neighborhood socioeconomic variables and BMI/waist circumference were empirically estimable in the French context, without excessive model extrapolations, despite the extent of socio-spatial segregation.

They are "specific" risk factors among PDs in that they withstand adjusting for the other PDs, whereas the reverse does not hold. Specificity is a classic sign of causation. This empirical work addresses 3 further problems that can undermine causal inferences in personality and substance-use research: hierarchical nature of etiologic factors in psychiatry, imperfectly operationalized PD criteria, and possible genetic or environmental confounding, as seen in lack of "etiologic continuity." We used exploratory structural equation bifactor modeling and biometric models to mitigate these problems. The participants were Norwegian adult twins of ages 19-36 years (N = 2,801). Criteria for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), PDs were assessed using a structured interview. General substance-use risk was indicated by World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interviewed alcohol use disorder and illicit drug use, and by self-reported regular smoking. A general risk factor for all criteria of both ASPD and BPD was the strongest individual correlate of general substance use and showed etiologic continuity, though just 3 specific PD criteria could predict substance use to the same extent. The findings indicate that a broad latent factor for both ASPD and BPD may be a specific and a genetically and environmentally unconfounded risk factor for substance use. Substance-use treatment research might benefit from attending to transdiagnostic models of ASPD, BPD, and related behavioral disinhibition.

Efficacy of Phototherapy for Newborns with Hyperbilirubinemia: A Cautionary Example of an Instrumental Variable Analysis	MEDICAL DECISION MAKING			English	Article						randomized trial methodology; risk factor evaluation; population-based studies; scale development	MANAGED CARE ORGANIZATION; TREATMENT-SELECTION BIAS; PROPENSITY SCORE; BILIRUBIN LEVELS; IMPACT; RISK; INFANTS; SURGERY; CANCER; ADHERE	Background. Use of instrumental variables is gaining popularity as a method of controlling for confounding by indication in observational studies of treatments. Objectives. To illustrate how unmeasured instrument-level treatment substitution can distort effect size estimates using as an example an instrumental variable analysis of phototherapy for neonatal jaundice. Design. Retrospective cohort study. Setting. Northern California Kaiser Permanente Hospitals. Patients. The authors studied 20,731 newborns >= 2000 g and >= 35 weeks' gestation born 1995-2004 with a "qualifying" total serum bilirubin (TSB) level within 3 mg/dL of the 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) phototherapy threshold who did not have a positive direct antiglobulin test. Measurements. The intervention was inpatient phototherapy within 8 hours of the qualifying TSB. The outcome was a TSB level exceeding the AAP exchange transfusion threshold < 48 hours from the qualifying TSB. The instrumental variable was a measure of the frequency of phototherapy use at the newborn's birth hospital. The unmeasured substituted treatment was supplementation with infant formula, assessed by chart review in a sample from the same cohort. Results. In total, 128 infants (0.62%) exceeded the exchange transfusion threshold. Logistic and propensity analyses yielded crude odds ratios of similar to 0.5 for phototherapy efficacy, decreasing to similar to 0.2 with control for confounding by indication. Instrumental variable analyses suggested much greater phototherapy efficacy (e.g., odds ratios of 0.02-0.05). However, chart reviews revealed greater use of infant formula (which also lowers bilirubin levels) in hospitals that used more phototherapy (r = 0.56; P = 0.02), an association not present at the individual level (r = 0.13). Conclusions. Instrumental variable analyses may provide biased estimates of treatment efficacy if there are cointerventions or confounders associated with treatment at the level of the instrument, although even when these associations may not exist in individuals.

When the confounders are themselves affected by treatment, standard regression adjustment is prone to severe bias. In contrast, G-estimation requires less stringent assumptions than path analysis using SEM to unbiasedly estimate the direct effect even in linear settings. In this article, we propose a G-estimation method to estimate the controlled direct effect of treatment on the outcome, by adapting existing G-estimation methods for time-varying treatments without mediators. The proposed method can accommodate continuous and noncontinuous mediators, and requires no models for the confounders. Unbiased estimation only requires correctly specifying a mean model for either the mediator or the outcome. The method is further extended to settings where the mediator or outcome, or both, are latent, and generalizes existing methods for single measurement occasions of the mediator and outcome to longitudinal data on the mediator and outcome. The methods are utilized to assess the effects of an intervention on physical activity that is possibly mediated by motivation to exercise in a randomized study.

Similar observations have been made with regard to factors other than smoking status, including socio-economic status, race and parity. Use of standardised birthweights, or birthweight z-scores, has been proposed as an approach to resolve the crossing of the curves that is the hallmark of the so-called birthweight paradox. In this paper, we utilise directed acyclic graphs, analytical proofs and an extensive simulation study to consider the use of z-scores of birthweight and their effect on statistical analysis. We illustrate the causal questions implied by inclusion of birthweight in statistical models, and illustrate the utility of models that include birthweight or z-scores to address those questions. Both analytically and through a simulation study we show that neither birthweight nor z-score adjustment may be used for effect decomposition. The z-score approach yields an unbiased estimate of the total effect, even when collider-stratification would adversely impact estimates from birthweight-adjusted models; however, the total effect could have been estimated more directly with an unadjusted model. The use of z-scores does not add additional information beyond the use of unadjusted models. Thus, the ability of z-scores to successfully resolve the paradoxical crossing of mortality curves is due to an alteration in the causal parameter being estimated (total effect), rather than adjustment for confounding or effect decomposition or other factors.

Infectious diseases may also affect child growth, however their actual impact on the latter can be difficult to quantify. In this paper, we analyse data from 20 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in 13 African countries to investigate the relationship between malaria and stunting. Our objective is to make inference on the association between malaria incidence during the first year of life and height-for-age Z-scores (HAZs). Methods: We develop a geostatistical model for HAZs as a function of both measured and unmeasured child-specific and spatial risk factors. We visualize stunting risk in each of the 20 analysed surveys by mapping the predictive probability that HAZ is below - 2. Finally, we carry out a meta-analysis by modelling the estimated effects of malaria incidence on HAZ from each DHS as a linear regression on national development indicators from the World Bank. Results: A non-spatial univariate linear regression of HAZ on malaria incidence showed a negative association in 18 out of 20 surveys. However, after adjusting for spatial risk factors and controlling for confounding effects, we found a weaker association between HAZ and malaria, with a mix of positive and negative estimates, of which 3 out of 20 are significantly different from zero at the conventional 5% level. The meta-analysis showed that this variation in the estimated effect of malaria incidence on HAZ is significantly associated with the amount of arable land. Conclusion: Confounding effects on the association between malaria and stunting vary both by country and over time. Geostatistical analysis provides a useful framework that allows to account for unmeasured spatial confounders. Establishing whether the association between malaria and stunting is causal would require longitudinal follow-up data on individual children.

This finding rests largely on correlational research designs, which rely at best on statistical controls for confounding. Here, we control for unmeasured confounders using a longitudinal study of twins. Method: In a sample of 4,078 American adult twins first assessed decades ago, we used cotwin control mixed effects models to evaluate the effect of lifetime average frequency of cannabis consumption measured on substance use, psychiatric, and psychosocial outcomes. Results: On average, participants had a lifetime cannabis frequency of about one to two times per month, across adolescence and adulthood. As expected, in individual-level analyses, cannabis use was significantly associated with almost all outcomes in the expected directions. However, when comparing each twin to their cotwin, which inherently controls for shared genes and environments, we observed within-pair differences consistent with possible causality in three of the 22 assessed outcomes: cannabis use disorder symptoms (beta(W-Pooled) = .15, SE = .02, p = 1.7 x10(-22)), frequency of tobacco use (beta(W-Pooled) = .06, SE = .01, p = 1.2 x10(-5)), and illicit drug involvement (beta(W-Pooled) = .06, SE = .02, p = 1.2 x 10(-4)). Covariate specification curve analyses indicated that within-pair effects on tobacco and illicit drug use, but not cannabis use disorder, attenuated substantially when covarying for lifetime alcohol and tobacco use. Conclusions: The cotwin control results suggest that more frequent cannabis use causes small increases in cannabis use disorder symptoms, approximately 1.3 symptoms when going from a once-a-year use to daily use. For other outcomes, our results are more consistent with familial confounding, at least in this community population of twins.

Three methods used to estimate deaths due to tobacco use are evaluated. Each method requires estimates of certain absolute and relative risks, and the published estimates based on them assume that the absolute and relative risks observed in the two large American Cancer Society prospective studies can be applied to the US population or to populations in developed countries. Computations using large representative samples of US decedents and of the entire US population for these methods result in estimated numbers of deaths for the US population that are substantially lower than those based on Cancer Prevention Survey-I or Cancer Prevention Survey-II. Computations also showed that controlling for confounding from two smoking-related variables results in still lower estimates of the number of excess deaths. Consequently, published results that ignore confounding and are based on nonrepresentative data overstate the contribution of smoking. It is imperative that estimates of excess deaths be based on representative data and control for relevant confounders.

Tchetgen			Robust inference on population indirect causal effects: the generalized front door criterion	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Double robustness; Front door criterion; Indirect effects; Mediation analysis; Population intervention effect	NATURAL DIRECT; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; MEDIATION ANALYSIS; IDENTIFICATION; MODELS; GUIDE	Standard methods for inference about direct and indirect effects require stringent no-unmeasured-confounding assumptions which often fail to hold in practice, particularly in observational studies. The goal of the paper is to introduce a new form of indirect effect, the population intervention indirect effect, that can be non-parametrically identified in the presence of an unmeasured common cause of exposure and outcome. This new type of indirect effect captures the extent to which the effect of exposure is mediated by an intermediate variable under an intervention that holds the component of exposure directly influencing the outcome at its observed value. The population intervention indirect effect is in fact the indirect component of the population intervention effect, introduced by Hubbard and Van der Laan. Interestingly, our identification criterion generalizes Judea Pearl's front door criterion as it does not require no direct effect of exposure not mediated by the intermediate variable. For inference, we develop both parametric and semiparametric methods, including a novel doubly robust semiparametric locally efficient estimator, that perform very well in simulation studies. Finally, the methods proposed are used to measure the effectiveness of monetary saving recommendations among women enrolled in a maternal health programme in Tanzania.

Can commonly prescribed drugs be repurposed for the prevention or treatment of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases? Protocol for an observational cohort study in the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink	BMJ OPEN			English	Article							IMMORTAL TIME BIAS; SELF-HARM; RISK; DEMENTIA; PREVALENCE; VALIDATION; METFORMIN; SUICIDE	Introduction: Current treatments for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases have only limited effectiveness meaning that there is an urgent need for new medications that could influence disease incidence and progression. We will investigate the potential of a selection of commonly prescribed drugs, as a more efficient and cost-effective method of identifying new drugs for the prevention or treatment of Alzheimer's disease, non-Alzheimer's disease dementias, Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our research will focus on drugs used for the treatment of hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and type 2 diabetes, all of which have previously been identified as potentially cerebroprotective and have variable levels of preclinical evidence that suggest they may have beneficial effects for various aspects of dementia pathology. Methods and analysis: We will conduct a hypothesis testing observational cohort study using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). Our analysis will consider four statistical methods, which have different approaches for modelling confounding. These are multivariable adjusted Cox regression; propensity matched regression; instrumental variable analysis and marginal structural models. We will also use an intention-to-treat analysis, whereby we will define all exposures based on the first prescription observed in the database so that the target parameter is comparable to that estimated by a randomised controlled trial. Ethics and dissemination: This protocol has been approved by the CPRD's Independent Scientific Advisory Committee (ISAC). We will publish the results of the study as open-access peer-reviewed publications and disseminate findings through national and international conferences as are appropriate.

The Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting (IPTW) method, based on propensity scores, has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in estimating ATE, assuming that the assumptions of exchangeability, consistency, and positivity are met. Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) offer a practical approach to assess the exchangeability assumption, which asserts that treatment assignment and potential outcomes are independent given a set of confounding variables that block all backdoor paths from treatment assignment to potential outcomes. To ensure a consistent ATE estimator, one can adjust for a minimally sufficient adjustment set of confounding variables that block all backdoor paths from treatment assignment to the outcome. To enhance the efficiency of ATE estimators, our proposal involves incorporating both the minimally sufficient adjustment set of confounding variables and predictors into the propensity score model. Extensive simulations were conducted to evaluate the performance of propensity score-based IPTW methods in estimating ATE when different sets of covariates were included in the propensity score models. The simulation results underscored the significance of including the minimally sufficient adjustment set of confounding variables along with predictors in the propensity score models to obtain a consistent and efficient ATE estimator. We applied this proposed method to investigate whether tracheostomy was causally associated with in-hospital infant mortality, utilizing the 2016 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kids' Inpatient Database. The estimated ATE was found to be approximately 2.30%-2.46% with p-value >0.05.

The time-related confounders that have been most frequently considered include age at risk, calendar period, duration of employment, length of follow-up, and employment status (active or retired). These factors are related to the healthy worker effect which is more pronounced among active workers, and declines with length of follow-up. Thus, these time-related factors are potential confounders in occupational cohort studies (and in nested case-control studies). It is therefore advisable to routinely control for length of follow-up and employment status, in addition to the usual confounding factors of age at risk and calendar period However, it should be stressed that this approach will minimise, but not eliminate, confounding due to the healthy worker effect. In particular, direct control for employment status is inadvisable if this constitutes an intermediate variable in the pathway between exposure and disease, and more complex analytical procedures are necessary in such situations. It is also important that the principle exposure under study should also be analyzed in a time-related manner, taking account of the likely induction and latency periods, and the relative etiological importance of exposure intensity, exposure duration and cumulative exposure. The simplest approach is to analyse the cumulative exposure in a time-related manner, and this may suffice when the aim is merely to consider whether or not there is an effect of exposure. However, once it has been provisionally assumed that an effect exists, attention then shifts to understanding the nature of the effect. In this context, the temporal pattern of exposure and outcome can be considered by examining the effects of exposures in specific time windows while controlling for time-related confounders, and for the effects of exposures in other time windows. A more sophisticated approach is direct fitting of a theoretical model of carcinogenesis, such as the Armitage-Doll or Moolgavkar models. However, it should be emphasized that occupational cohort studies only rarely have sufficient numbers, and data of sufficient quality, to permit meaningful conclusions to be drawn from more sophisticated analyses of this type.

This increase in importance is partially a result of the development of Bayesian statistical methodologies that make it possible to study associations between health problems and risk factors at an aggregate (i.e. areal) level while taking into account such matters as unmeasured confounding and spatial relationships. In this paper we present a demonstration of the joint use of empirical Bayes (EB) and full Bayesian inferential techniques in a small area study of adverse medical events (also known as 'iatrogenic injury') in British Columbia, Canada. In particular, we illustrate a unified Bayesian hierarchical spatial modelling framework that enables simultaneous examinations of potential associations between adverse medical event occurrence and regional characteristics, age effects, residual variation and spatial autocorrelation. We propose an analytic strategy for complementary use of EB and FB inferential techniques for risk assessment and model selection, presenting an EB-FB combined approach that draws on the strengths of each method while minimizing inherent weaknesses. The work was motivated by the need to explore relatively efficient ways to analyse regional variations of health services outcomes and resource utilization when a considerable amount of statistical modelling and inference are required.

SES and correlated factors do not explain the association between periodontal disease, edentulism, and cancer risk	ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Periodontal disease; Edentulism; Gum disease; Cancer; SES; Confounding	ATHEROSCLEROSIS RISK; SOCIOECONOMIC POSITION; POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN; COMMUNITIES; SURVEILLANCE; LIFE	Purpose: Severe periodontal disease and edentulism have been previously reported to be significantly associated with cancer risk and mortality, including in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (2018); however, complex sources of confounding by socioeconomic status (SES), and characteristics correlated with SES, could have been present in earlier analyses. Methods: To capture life course SES and its correlates, we generated a propensity score and included it, along with other potential confounders such as smoking and obesity, into a Cox regression model to examine the association between periodontal disease and cancer risk. In addition, we stratified the model with the propensity score by low and high SES. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Compared with our previous study, the associations for severe periodontitis and cancer incidence remained comparable after weighting by the propensity score (e.g., for total cancer: before weighting, hazard ratio = 1.24, 95% confidence interval = 1.07-1.42 vs. after weighting, hazard ratio = 1.23, 95% confidence interval = 1.05-1.44 when comparing severe periodontitis to no or mild periodontitis). Associations were comparable in low and high SES strata and statistically significant among participants with high SES. Conclusions: Complex sources of confounding by SES and its correlates are unlikely to fully account for the positive associations observed for periodontal disease and edentulism and cancer risk.

Quantification of collider-stratification bias and the birthweight paradox	PAEDIATRIC AND PERINATAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						collider-stratification bias; birthweight; directed acyclic graphs; neonatal nortality	PERINATAL-MORTALITY; CAUSAL DIAGRAMS; INFANT-MORTALITY; ADJUSTMENT; TIME; CURVES; MODELS	The 'birthweight paradox' describes the phenomenon whereby birthweight-specific mortality curves cross when stratified on other exposures, most notably cigarette smoking. The paradox has been noted widely in the literature and numerous explanations and corrections have been suggested. Recently, causal diagrams have been used to illustrate the possibility for collider-stratification bias in models adjusting for birthweight. When two variables share a common effect, stratification on the variable representing that effect induces a statistical relation between otherwise independent factors. This bias has been proposed to explain the birthweight paradox. Causal diagrams may illustrate sources of bias, but are limited to describing qualitative effects. In this paper, we provide causal diagrams that illustrate the birthweight paradox and use a simulation study to quantify the collider-stratification bias under a range of circumstances. Considered circumstances include exposures with and without direct effects on neonatal mortality, as well as with and without indirect effects acting through birthweight on neonatal mortality. The results of these simulations illustrate that when the birthweight-mortality relation is subject to substantial uncontrolled confounding, the bias on estimates of effect adjusted for birthweight may be sufficient to yield opposite causal conclusions, i.e. a factor that poses increased risk appears protective. Effects on stratum-specific birthweight-mortality curves were considered to illustrate the connection between collider-stratification bias and the crossing of the curves. The simulations demonstrate the conditions necessary to give rise to empirical evidence of the paradox.

We assessed the association between parental unemployment and changes in adolescent psychotropic medication purchases, with longitudinal individual-level fixed-effects models that controlled for time-invariant confounding. We used data from a large, register-based panel of Finnish adolescents aged 13-20 years in 1987-2012 (n = 138,644) that included annual measurements of mothers' and fathers' employment and offspring psychotropic medication purchases. We assessed changes in the probability of adolescent psychotropic medication purchases in the years before, during, and after the first episode of parental unemployment. There was no association between mother's unemployment and offspring psychotropic purchases in the fixed-effects models, suggesting this association is largely driven by unmeasured confounding and selection. By contrast, father's unemployment led to a significant 15%-20% increase in the probability of purchasing psychotropic medication among adolescents even after extensive controls for observed and unobserved confounding. This change takes at least 1 year to emerge, but it is long-lasting; thus, policies are needed that mitigate the harm of father's unemployment on offspring's mental well-being.

Propensity score model overfitting led to inflated variance of estimated odds ratios	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Propensity score; Logistic regression; Overfitting; Confounder adjustment; Odds ratio; Inverse probability weighting	VARIABLE SELECTION; REGRESSION-MODELS; EVENTS; SIMULATION; SPLINES; NUMBER; CARE	Objective: Simulation studies suggest that the ratio of the number of events to the number of estimated parameters in a logistic regression model should be not less than 10 or 20 to 1 to achieve reliable effect estimates. Applications of propensity score approaches for confounding control in practice, however, do often not consider these recommendations. Study Design and Setting: We conducted extensive Monte Carlo and plasmode simulation studies to investigate the impact of propensity score model overfitting on the performance in estimating conditional and marginal odds ratios using different established propensity score inference approaches. We assessed estimate accuracy and precision as well as associated type I error and type II error rates in testing the null hypothesis of no exposure effect. Results: For all inference approaches considered, our simulation study revealed considerably inflated standard errors of effect estimates when using overfitted propensity score models. Overfitting did not considerably affect type I error rates for most inference approaches. However, because of residual confounding, estimation performance and type I error probabilities were unsatisfactory when using propensity score quintile adjustment. Conclusion: Overfitting of propensity score models should be avoided to obtain reliable estimates of treatment or exposure effects in individual studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Here, we present a counterfactual framework and provide guidance to harmonize methodologies and optimize study quality. In AMR-burden studies, 2 counterfactual approaches have been applied: the harm of drug-resistant infections relative to the harm of the same drug-susceptible infections (the susceptible-infection counterfactual); and the total harm of drug-resistant infections relative to a situation where such infections were prevented (the no-infection counterfactual). We propose to use an interventionbased causal approach to determine the most appropriate counterfactual. We show that intervention scenarios, species of interest, and types of infections influence the choice of counterfactual. We recommend using purposedesigned cohort studies to apply this counterfactual framework, whereby the selection of cohorts (patients with drug-resistant, drug-susceptible infections, and those with no infection) should be based on matching on time to infection through exposure density sampling to avoid biased estimates. Application of survival methods is preferred, considering competing events. We conclude by advocating estimation of the burden of AMR by using the no-infection and susceptible-infection counterfactuals. The resulting numbers will provide policy-relevant information about the upper and lower bound of future interventions designed to control AMR. The counterfactuals should be applied in cohort studies, whereby selection of the unexposed cohorts should be based on exposure density sampling, applying methods avoiding time-dependent bias and confounding.

Because confounding by unmeasured factors cannot generally be ruled out with certainty in observational studies or randomized trials subject to noncompliance, we propose a general instrumental variable (IV) approach to learning optimal treatment regimes under endogeneity. Specifically, we establish identification of both value functionfor a given regimeand optimal regimeswith the aid of a binary IV, when no unmeasured confounding fails to hold. We also construct novel multiply robust classification-based estimators. Furthermore, we propose to identify and estimate optimal treatment regimes among those who would comply to the assigned treatment under a monotonicity assumption. In this latter case, we establish the somewhat surprising result that complier optimal regimes can be consistently estimated without directly collecting compliance information and therefore without the complier average treatment effect itself being identified. Our approach is illustrated via extensive simulation studies and a data application on the effect of child rearing on labor participation.for this article are available online.

We conceive a similar scientific question of interest in the current manuscript except that we are interested in modeling the time of ART regimen change rather than a comparison of two or more ART regimens. The answer to this scientific riddle is unknown and has been difficult to address clinically. Naturally, ART regimen change is left to a participant and his or her provider and so the date of change depends on participant characteristics. There exists a vast literature on how to address potential confounding and those techniques are vital to the success of the method here. A more substantial challenge is devising a systematic modeling strategy to overcome the missing time of regimen change for those participants who do not switch to second-line ART within the study period even after failing the initial ART. In this article, we adopt and apply a statistical method that was originally proposed for modeling infusion trial data, where infusion length may be informatively censored, and argue that the same strategy may be employed here. Our application of this method to therapeutic HIV/AIDS studies is new and interesting. Using data from the AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) Study A5095, we model immunological endpoints as a polynomial function of a participant's switching time to second-line ART for 182 participants who already failed the initial ART. In our analysis, we find that participants who switch early have somewhat better sustained suppression of HIV-1 RNA after virological failure than those who switch later. However, we also found that participants who switched very late, possibly censored due to the end of the study, had good HIV-1 RNA suppression, on average. We believe our scientific conclusions contribute to the relevant HIV literature and hope that the basic modeling strategy outlined here would be useful to others contemplating similar analyses with partially missing treatment length data.

On the other hand, gradient studies have a long tradition in the research of air pollution effects on plants. While there is no principal difference between gradient and epidemiological studies, the former addressmore one-dimensional transects while the latter focus more on populations and include more experience in making quantitative predictions, in dealing with confounding factors and in taking into account the complex interplay of different factors acting at different levels. Epidemiological analyses may disentangle and quantify the contributions of different predictor variables to an overall effect, e.g. plant growth, and may generate hypotheses deserving further study in experiments. Therefore, their use in ecosystem research is encouraged. This article provides a number of recommendations on: (1) spatial and temporal aspects in preparing predictor maps of nitrogen deposition, ozone exposure and meteorological covariates; (2) extent of a dataset required for an analysis; (3) choice of the appropriate regression model and conditions to be satisfied by the data; (4) selection of the relevant explanatory variables; (5) treatment of interactions and confounding factors; and (6) assessment of model validity.

However, the understanding of the interactions between respiratory viruses at the population level is still very limited. We here conducted a prospective laboratory-based etiological study by enrolling 14,426 patients suffered from acute respiratory infection (ARI) in Beijing, China during 2005 to 2015. All 18 respiratory viruses were simultaneously tested for each nasal and throat swabs collected from enrolled patients using molecular tests. The virus correlations were quantitatively evaluated, and the respiratory viruses could be divided into two panels according to the positive and negative correlations. One included influenza viruses (IFVs) A, B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), while the other included human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) 1/3, 2/4, adenovirus (Adv), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and enterovirus (including rhinovirus, named picoRNA), & alpha; and & beta; human coronaviruses (HCoVs). The viruses were positive-correlated in each panel, while negative-correlated between panels. After adjusting the confounding factors by vector autoregressive model, positive interaction between IFV-A and RSV and negative interaction between IFV-A and picoRNA are still be observed. The asynchronous interference of IFV-A significantly delayed the peak of & beta; human coronaviruses epidemic. The binary property of the respiratory virus interactions provides new insights into the viral epidemic dynamics in human population, facilitating the development of infectious disease control and prevention strategies.IMPORTANCE Systematic quantitative assessment of the interactions between different respiratory viruses is pivotal for the prevention of infectious diseases and the development of vaccine strategies. Our data showed stable interactions among respiratory viruses at human population level, which are season irrelevant. Respiratory viruses could be divided into two panels according to their positive and negative correlations. One included influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus, while the other included other common respiratory viruses. It showed negative correlations between the two panels. The asynchronous interference between influenza virus and & beta; human coronaviruses significantly delayed the peak of & beta; human coronaviruses epidemic. The binary property of the viruses indicated transient immunity induced by one kind of virus would play role on subsequent infection, which provides important data for the development of epidemic surveillance strategies. Systematic quantitative assessment of the interactions between different respiratory viruses is pivotal for the prevention of infectious diseases and the development of vaccine strategies.

Heterogeneous Treatment Effects of Breastfeeding on Child Development	SOCIAL FORCES			English	Article						children; health; inequality; social stratification	PROPENSITY SCORE; COGNITIVE-DEVELOPMENT; UNITED-STATES; OBESITY; DISPARITIES; DURATION; HEALTH; IMPACT; ASSOCIATION; EXCLUSIVITY	The slogan "Breast is Best" has been popularized by medical organizations and parenting networks to extoll the benefits of breastfeeding, yet the causal effects are widely debated. Our study contributes to the debate by examining whether breastfeeding has differential effects based on the propensity to breastfeed, which is also known as causal effect heterogeneity. Prior studies attempt to isolate the causal effect of breastfeeding by netting out confounding characteristics, but we argue that the effects of breastmilk are unlikely to operate in a vacuum. The social forces that promote or constrain breastfeeding among different populations in American society can also shape its effects. Using rich intergenerational panel data from the NLSY79 Child and Young Adult cohort (n = 7902), we evaluate heterogeneous treatment effects in the relationship between breastfeeding and child development from ages 4 to 14 using stratification-multilevel propensity score models. We find that breastfeeding is associated with small benefits for behavioral development, math scores, and academic ability among those with the highest propensities to breastfeed. By contrast, its small benefits for reading comprehension and vocabulary are concentrated among children with the lowest propensities to breastfeed. Our findings suggest that the social process of selection into breastfeeding cannot be fully disentangled from its estimated effects. The social context not only shapes who breastfeeds in American society, but also who benefits most.

It is common practice to adjust for as many variables as possible in observational studies in the hopes of reducing confounding by other variables. However, indiscriminate adjustment for variables using standard regression models may actually lead to biased estimates. In this paper, we differentiate between confounders, mediators, colliders, and effect modifiers. We will discuss that while confounders should be adjusted for in the analysis, one should be wary of adjusting for colliders. Mediators should not be adjusted for when examining the total effect of an exposure on an outcome. Automated statistical programs should not be used to decide which variables to include in causal models. Using a case scenario in cardiology, we will demonstrate how to identify confounders, colliders, mediators and effect modifiers and the implications of adjustment or non-adjustment for each of them.

J	Deng, YQ; Pan, W				Deng, Yangqing; Pan, Wei			Model checking via testing for direct effects in Mendelian Randomization and transcriptome-wide association studies	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							GWAS; POWERFUL; LOCI; EQTL	It is of great interest and potential to discover causal relationships between pairs of exposures and outcomes using genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs) to deal with hidden confounding in observational studies. Two most popular approaches are Mendelian randomization (MR), which usually use independent genetic variants/SNPs across the genome, and transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) (or their generalizations) using cis-SNPs local to a gene (or some genome-wide and likely dependent SNPs), as IVs. In spite of their many promising applications, both approaches face a major challenge: the validity of their causal conclusions depends on three critical assumptions on valid IVs, and more generally on other modeling assumptions, which however may not hold in practice. The most likely as well as challenging situation is due to the wide-spread horizontal pleiotropy, leading to two of the three IV assumptions being violated and thus to biased statistical inference. More generally, we'd like to conduct a goodness-of-fit (GOF) test to check the model being used. Although some methods have been proposed as being robust to various degrees to the violation of some modeling assumptions, they often give different and even conflicting results due to their own modeling assumptions and possibly lower statistical efficiency, imposing difficulties to the practitioner in choosing and interpreting varying results across different methods. Hence, it would help to directly test whether any assumption is violated or not. In particular, there is a lack of such tests for TWAS. We propose a new and general GOF test, called TEDE (TEsting Direct Effects), applicable to both correlated and independent SNPs/IVs (as commonly used in TWAS and MR respectively). Through simulation studies and real data examples, we demonstrate high statistical power and advantages of our new method, while confirming the frequent violation of modeling (including valid IV) assumptions in practice and thus the importance of model checking by applying such a test in MR/TWAS analysis. Author summary With the increasing availability of large-scale GWAS summary data of various complex traits/diseases and software packages, it has become convenient and popular to apply Mendelian randomization (MR) and transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), using genetic variants as instrumental variables (IVs), to address fundamental and significant questions by unraveling causal relationships between complex or molecular traits such as gene expression and other complex traits. However, the validity of such causal conclusions critically depends on the validity of the model being used, including three key IV assumptions. In particular, with the wide-spread horizontal pleiotropy of genetic variants, two of the three IV assumptions may be violated, leading to biased inference from MR and TWAS. This issue may become more severe as more trait-associated genetic variants are used as IVs to increase the power of MR and TWAS. Although there are some methods to check the modeling assumptions for MR with independent genetic variants as IVs, there is barely any powerful one for TWAS (or more generally for MR and similar methods) with correlated SNPs as IVs. We propose such a powerful method applicable to both MR and TWAS with local or genome-wide, possibly correlated/dependent, SNPs as IVs, demonstrating its higher statistical power than several commonly used methods, while confirming the frequent violation of modeling/IV assumptions in TWAS with our example GWAS data of schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease and blood lipids. An important conclusion is that in practice it is necessary to conduct model checking in MR and TWAS, and our proposed method is expected to be useful for such a task.

Using data on a helminth infection, we review the use of three parametric tests (analysis of variance, linear regression, and logistic regression), address the complications arising from violation of the assumptions for these tests, and suggest methods of correction. We also compare the relative merits of parametric methods with equivalent non-parametric approaches, and illustrate the differences produced with results from a Kruskal-Wallis test and a t test. The value of using a resampling method-bootstrapping-is also shown. Finally, we discuss problems arising from use of a study design that requires data on the same attribute to be collected from the same individual over a period of time, and present three methods for overcoming this complication, showing that, in the example used, the mixed effect model and generalised estimating equation give similar results.

A multiple logistic-regression model permitted the estimation of odds ratios of ischemic stroke for each risk factor while adjusting for confounding variables. The final model, in addition to age and date of stroke, included transient ischemic attacks, hypertension, current smoking, atrial fibrillation, ischemic heart disease, mitral valve disease (other than prolapse), and diabetes mellitus. The process identified interactions showing that ischemic stroke incidence for persons with transient ischemic attacks was higher in women than in men and that the risk decreased with increasing age; that the risk of stroke with hypertension and also with current cigarette smoking decreased with increasing age; and that the risk of ischemic stroke with intermittent or persistent atrial fibrillation was similar when hypertension was present, but without hypertension the risk of stroke was more than seven times greater with persistent-than with intermittent atrial fibrillation. None of the odds ratios differed over the five quinquennia of the study, and no effect of antihypertensive treatment on stroke incidence could be demonstrated in the population.

Modeling HLA associations with EBV-positive and -negative Hodgkin lymphoma suggests distinct mechanisms in disease pathogenesis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Article						Hodgkin lymphoma; EBV; HLA	EPSTEIN-BARR-VIRUS; ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC-LEUKEMIA; GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; T-CELL RESPONSE; INFECTIOUS-MONONUCLEOSIS; CLASS-I; YOUNG-ADULTS; SUSCEPTIBILITY; RISK; REGION	HLA genotyping and genome wide association studies provide strong evidence for associations between Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) alleles and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Analysis of these associations is complicated by the extensive linkage disequilibrium within the major histocompatibility region and recent data suggesting that associations with EBV-positive and EBV-negative cHL are largely distinct. To distinguish independent and therefore potentially causal associations from associations confounded by linkage disequilibrium, we applied a variable selection regression modeling procedure to directly typed HLA class I and II genes and selected SNPs from EBV-stratified patient subgroups. In final models, HLA-A*01:01 and B*37:01 were associated with an increased risk of EBV-positive cHL whereas DRB1*15:01 and DPB1*01:01 were associated with decreased risk. Effects were independent of a prior history of infectious mononucleosis. For EBV-negative cHL the class II SNP rs6903608 remained the strongest predictor of disease risk after adjusting for the effects of common HLA alleles. Associations with all cHL and differences by case EBV status reflected the subgroup analysis. In conclusion, this study extends previous findings by identifying novel HLA associations with EBV-stratified subgroups of cHL, highlighting those alleles likely to be biologically relevant and strengthening evidence implicating genetic variation associated with the SNP rs6903608. What's new? Strong evidence exists for associations between HLA alleles and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Analysis is however complicated by the linkage disequilibrium within the MHC region and data suggesting that associations with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive and negative cHL are distinct. In the largest study to date to investigate associations between EBV-stratified cHL subgroups and directly typed HLA alleles, the authors extend associations with EBV-positive cHL to novel HLA class II alleles, which are associated with decreased disease risk. For EBV-negative disease, the class II SNP rs6903608 remains the strongest predictor of risk after adjusting for the effects of common HLA alleles.	[Johnson, Paul C.

Assessing the component associations of the healthy worker survivor bias: occupational asbestos exposure and lung cancer mortality	ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Epidemiologic methods; Occupational health; Healthy worker effect; Bias; Lung cancer; Mortality	DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPHS; TEXTILE WORKERS; REGRESSION-MODELS; LONGITUDINAL DATA; COHORT MORTALITY; INFERENCE; SELECTION; MOBILITY; DISEASE; RISK	Background: The healthy worker survivor bias is well-recognized in occupational epidemiology. Three component associations are necessary for this bias to occur: i) prior exposure and employment status; ii) employment status and subsequent exposure; and iii) employment status and mortality. Together, these associations result in time-varying confounding affected by prior exposure. We illustrate how these associations can be assessed using standard regression methods. Methods: We use data from 2975 asbestos textile factory workers hired between January 1940 and December 1965 and followed for lung cancer mortality through December 2001. Results: At entry, median age was 24 years, with 42% female and 19% non-Caucasian. Over follow-up, 21% and 17% of person-years were classified as at work and exposed to any asbestos, respectively. For a 100 fiber-year/mL increase in cumulative asbestos, the covariate-adjusted hazard of leaving work decreased by 52% (95% confidence interval [CI], 46-58). The association between employment status and subsequent asbestos exposure was strong due to nonpositivity: 88.3% of person-years at work (95% CI, 87.0-89.5) were classified as exposed to any asbestos; no person-years were classified as exposed to asbestos after leaving work. Finally, leaving active employment was associated with a 48% (95% CI, 9-71) decrease in the covariate-adjusted hazard of lung cancer mortality. Conclusions: We found strong associations for the components of the healthy worker survivor bias in these data. Standard methods, which fail to properly account for time-varying confounding affected by prior exposure, may provide biased estimates of the effect of asbestos on lung cancer mortality under these conditions.

J	Mathur, MB				Mathur, Maya B.			The M-Value: A Simple Sensitivity Analysis for Bias Due to Missing Data in Treatment Effect Estimates	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						bias analysis; collider stratification; selection bias; sensitivity analysis	CAUSAL DIAGRAMS	Complete-case analyses can be biased if missing data are not missing completely at random. We propose simple sensitivity analyses that apply to complete-case estimates of treatment effects; these analyses use only simple summary data and obviate specifying the precise mechanism of missingness and making distributional assumptions. Bias arises when treatment effects differ between retained and nonretained participants or, among retained participants, the estimate is biased because conditioning on retention has induced a noncausal path between the treatment and outcome. We thus bound the overall treatment effect on the difference scale by specifying: 1) the unobserved treatment effect among nonretained participants; and 2) the strengths of association that unobserved variables have with the exposure and with the outcome among retained participants ("induced confounding associations"). Working with the former sensitivity parameter subsumes certain existing methods of worst-case imputation while also accommodating less-conservative assumptions (e.g., that the treatment is not detrimental on average even among nonretained participants). As an analog to the E-value for confounding, we propose the M-value, which represents, for a specified treatment effect among nonretained participants, the strength of induced confounding associations required to reduce the treatment effect to the null or to any other value. These methods could help characterize the robustness of complete-case analyses to potential bias due to missing data.

Estimation of the optimal regime in treatment of prostate cancer recurrence from observational data using flexible weighting models	BIOMETRICS			English	Article						Causal inference; Dynamic treatment regime; Inverse probability weighting; Random forest; Restricted mean survival time	DYNAMIC TREATMENT REGIMES; INVERSE PROBABILITY; SALVAGE THERAPY; CLINICAL-TRIAL; NONCOMPLIANCE; REGRESSION; INFERENCE; TIME	Prostate cancer patients are closely followed after the initial therapy and salvage treatment may be prescribed to prevent or delay cancer recurrence. The salvage treatment decision is usually made dynamically based on the patient's evolving history of disease status and other time-dependent clinical covariates. A multi-center prostate cancer observational study has provided us data on longitudinal prostate specific antigen (PSA) measurements, time-varying salvage treatment, and cancer recurrence time. These data enable us to estimate the best dynamic regime of salvage treatment, while accounting for the complicated confounding of time-varying covariates present in the data. A Random Forest based method is used to model the probability of regime adherence and inverse probability weights are used to account for the complexity of selection bias in regime adherence. The optimal regime is then identified by the largest restricted mean survival time. We conduct simulation studies with different PSA trends to mimic both simple and complex regime adherence mechanisms. The proposed method can efficiently accommodate complex and possibly unknown adherence mechanisms, and it is robust to cases where the proportional hazards assumption is violated. We apply the method to data collected from the observational study and estimate the best salvage treatment regime in managing the risk of prostate cancer recurrence.

Risk factors for acute toxoplasmosis in England and Wales	EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION			English	Article						Epidemiology; toxoplasmosis	PREGNANT-WOMEN; INFECTION; GONDII; PATHOGENS; OUTBREAK; ANIMALS	Over 300 cases of acute toxoplasmosis are confirmed by reference testing in England and Wales annually. We conducted a case-control study to identify risk factors for Toxoplasma gondii infection to inform prevention strategies. Twenty-eight cases and 27 seronegative controls participated. We compared their food history and environmental exposures using logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals in a model controlling for age and sex. Univariable analysis showed that the odds of eating beef (OR 10<bold></bold>7, P < 0<bold></bold>001), poultry (OR 6<bold></bold>4, P = 0<bold></bold>01) or lamb/mutton (OR 4<bold></bold>9, P = 0<bold></bold>01) was higher for cases than controls. After adjustment for potential confounders a strong association between beef and infection remained (OR 5<bold></bold>6, P = 0<bold></bold>01). The small sample size was a significant limitation and larger studies are needed to fully investigate potential risk factors. The study findings emphasize the need to ensure food is thoroughly cooked and handled hygienically, especially for those in vulnerable groups.	[Said, B.; Halsby, K. D.; O'Connor, C.

J	Lee, KS; Yang, YL				Lee, Kristen Schultz; Yang, Yulin			Educational attainment and emotional well-being in adolescence and adulthood	SSM-MENTAL HEALTH			English	Article						Education; Emotional well-being; Early adulthood	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; MENTAL-HEALTH; PLAY; GREEN; NEIGHBORHOODS; STRESS; BENEFITS; POVERTY	Education has been conceptualized as a causal factor leading to emotional well-being. However, it is also possible that some of the effect of education may be due to selection factors. Analyzing data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n 1/4 10,908), we asked: to what extent does educational attainment increase emotional well-being once stable observed and unobserved individual characteristics are accounted for? Findings from fixed effects models showed that attaining a college degree was associated with greater emotional well-being. However, interactions with gender indicate that the positive association with emotional well-being is primarily for women, although a small negative association between completing college and depressive affect was found for men. These findings point to unmeasured confounding factors as motivating some of the association between educational attainment and emotional well-being among adolescents and adults.

Risk of de novo severe carpal tunnel syndrome after bilateral oophorectomy: a population-based cohort study	MENOPAUSE-THE JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN MENOPAUSE SOCIETY			English	Article						Benign ovarian condition; Bilateral oophorectomy; Carpal tunnel syndrome; Confounding; Estrogen therapy; Menopause	MEDICAL-RECORDS-LINKAGE; DATA RESOURCE PROFILE; UNDERWENT OOPHORECTOMY; WOMEN; ESTROGEN; EXPRESSION; RECEPTORS; SYSTEM; TISSUE; GENES	Objective: The incidence of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is higher in women, and peaks around the age of menopause. Therefore, we investigated whether bilateral oophorectomy is associated with an increased risk of severe CTS. Methods: We included all of the 1,653 premenopausal women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy for a nonmalignant indication between 1988 and 2007, and a random sample of 1,653 age-matched referent women who did not undergo bilateral oophorectomy in Olmsted County, MN. Diagnoses of CTS assigned to women over their entire lifetime were identified in these two cohorts. The risk of de novo severe CTS after bilateral oophorectomy (or index date) was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for potential confounders. Results: Bilateral oophorectomy was associated with an increased risk of severe CTS (adjusted hazard ratio 1.65, 95% confidence interval 1.20-2.25). The risk was suggestively greater in women with lower body mass index, nulliparity, and with a benign ovarian indication for oophorectomy (nonsignificant interactions). We did not observe a protective effect of estrogen therapy after the oophorectomy. The findings were similar in secondary analyses considering the incidence of CTS of any severity or idiopathic CTS. Conclusions: The risk of severe CTS, common in perimenopausal women, is increased after bilateral oophorectomy. The association may be causal or due to confounding. Therefore, the precise biological mechanisms explaining the association and the absence of a mitigating effect of estrogen therapy should be further investigated.

This potential limitation is likely to be particularly problematic for volunteers who, by definition, are self-selected and known to be significantly different from non-volunteers across a range of factors associated with better survival. Methods: This is a census-based record-linkage study of 308 733 married couples aged 25 and over, including 100 571 volunteers, with mortality follow-up for 33 months. We used a standard Cox model to examine whether mortality risk in the partners of volunteers was influenced by partner volunteering status-something expected if the effects of volunteering on mortality risk were due to shared household or behavioural characteristics. Results: Volunteers were general more affluent, better educated and more religious than their non-volunteering peers; they also had a lower mortality risk [hazard ratio (HR) (adj) - 0.78: 95% confidence interval (CI) - 0.71, 0.85 for males and HRadj - 0.77: 95% CI = 0.68, 0.88 for females]. However, amongst cohort members who were not volunteers, having a partner who was a volunteer was not associated with a mortality advantage (HRadj =1.01: 95% CI =0.92, 1.11 for men and HRadj = 1.00: 95% CI = 0.88, 1.13 women). Conclusions: This study provides further evidence that the lower mortality associated with volunteering is unlikely to be due to health selection or to residual confounding arising from unmeasured selection effects within households. It therefore increases the plausibility of a direct causal effect.

To date, methods for dynamic treatment regimes have been developed under the assumption that observation times, that is, treatment and outcome monitoring times, are determined by study investigators. That assumption is often not satisfied in electronic health records data in which the outcome, the observation times, and the treatment mechanism are associated with patients' characteristics. The treatment and observation processes can lead to spurious associations between the treatment of interest and the outcome to be optimized under the dynamic treatment regime if not adequately considered in the analysis. We address these associations by incorporating two inverse weights that are functions of a patient's covariates into dynamic weighted ordinary least squares to develop optimal single stage dynamic treatment regimes, known as individualized treatment rules. We show empirically that our methodology yields consistent, multiply robust estimators. In a cohort of new users of antidepressant drugs from the United Kingdom's Clinical Practice Research Datalink, the proposed method is used to develop an optimal treatment rule that chooses between two antidepressants to optimize a utility function related to the change in body mass index.

The authors use simulations to examine the effects of two major methodological problems that affect these studies: measurement error and misspecification of the risk model. In a simulation study of the effect of measurement error caused by the sampling process used to estimate radon exposure for a geographic unit, both the effect of radon and the standard error of the effect estimate were underestimated, with greater bias for smaller sample sizes, in another simulation study, which addressed the consequences of uncontrolled confounding by cigarette smoking, even small negative correlations between county geometric mean annual radon exposure and the proportion of smokers resulted in negative average estimates of the radon effect. A third study considered consequences of using simple linear ecologic models when the true underlying model relation between lung cancer and radon exposure is nonlinear. These examples quantify potential biases and demonstrate the limitations of estimating risks from ecologic studies of lung cancer and indoor radon.

Home Hemodialysis and Mortality Risk in Australian and New Zealand Populations	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF KIDNEY DISEASES			English	Article						Home hemodialysis; dialysis modality; multivariate analysis; marginal structural models; mortality	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; STAGE RENAL-DISEASE; FREQUENT NOCTURNAL HEMODIALYSIS; AMBULATORY PERITONEAL-DIALYSIS; ACTIVE ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; CONVENTIONAL HEMODIALYSIS; IN-CENTER; SURVIVAL; TIME	Background: There is a resurgence of interest in home hemodialysis (HD), especially frequent or extended forms involving unconventionally frequent (>3 times/wk) and/or long (>6 hours) treatments. This resurgence is driven by cost containment and experience suggesting lower mortality risk compared with facility HD and peritoneal dialysis (PD). Study Design: We performed an observational cohort study using the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry, using marginal structural modeling to adjust for time-varying medical comorbidity as both a source of selection bias and an intermediary variable on the causal pathway to death. Setting & Participants: All adult patients starting renal replacement therapy in Australia and New Zealand since March 31, 1996, followed up to December 31, 2007. Predictor: The main predictor was dialysis modality (conventional facility HD, conventional home HD, frequent/extended facility HD, frequent/extended home HD, and PD). We adjusted for the confounding effects of patient demographics and comorbid conditions. Outcome: Patient mortality. Results: We analyzed 26,016 patients with 856,007 patient-months of follow-up. Relative to conventional facility HD, adjusted mortality HRs were 0.51 (95% CI, 0.44-0.59) for conventional home HD, 1.16 (95% CI, 0.94-1.44) for frequent/extended facility HD, 0.53 (95% CI, 0.41-0.68) for frequent/extended home HD, and 1.10 (95% CI, 1.06-1.16) for PD. The apparent benefit of home HD on mortality risk was less for patients who were nonwhite, non-Asian, and older. Limitations: Potential for residual confounding from the limited collection of comorbid conditions (no collection of cognitive or motor impairment, depression, left ventricular volume or structure, or blood pressure/fluid volume status) and lack of socioeconomic, medication, and biochemical data in analyses. Conclusions: Our study supports a survival advantage of home HD without a difference between conventional and frequent/extended modalities. Suitably designed clinical trials of frequent/extended HD are needed to determine the presence and extent of mortality benefit with this modality. Am J Kidney Dis. 58(5):782-793.

Ignoring competing risks in the analysis can result in biased conclusions. In addition, possible confounding bias of the treatment-outcome relationship has to be addressed, when estimating treatment effects from observational data. In order to provide tools for estimation of average treatment effects on time-to-event outcomes in the presence of competing risks, we developed the R package causalCmprsk. We illustrate the package functionality in the estimation of effects of a right heart catheterization procedure on discharge and in-hospital death from observational data. Methods: The causalCmprsk package implements an inverse probability weighting estimation approach, aiming to emulate baseline randomization and alleviate possible treatment selection bias. The package allows for different types of weights, representing different target populations. causalCmprsk builds on existing methods from survival analysis and adapts them to the causal analysis in non-parametric and semi-parametric frameworks. Results: The causalCmprsk package has two main functions: fit.cox assumes a semiparametric structural Cox proportional hazards model for the counterfactual cause-specific hazards, while fit.nonpar does not impose any structural assumptions. In both frameworks, causalCmprsk implements estimators of (i) absolute risks for each treatment arm, e.g., cumulative hazards or cumulative incidence functions, and (ii) relative treatment effects, e.g., hazard ratios, or restricted mean time differences. The latter treatment effect measure translates the treatment effect from probability into more intuitive time domain and allows the user to quantify, for example, by how many days or months the treatment accelerates the recovery or postpones illness or death. Conclusions: The causalCmprsk package provides a convenient and useful tool for causal analysis of competing risks data.

In the setting with two sequential mediators, there are a variety of decompositions of the total risk difference into mediation effects. We derive sharp and valid bounds for a number of mediation effects in the setting of two sequential mediators both with unmeasured confounding with the outcome. We provide five such bounds in the main text corresponding to two different decompositions of the total effect, as well as the controlled direct effect, with an additional 30 novel bounds provided in the supplementary materials corresponding to the terms of 24 four-way decompositions. We also show that, although it may seem that one can produce sharp bounds by adding or subtracting the limits of the sharp bounds for terms in a decomposition, this almost always produces valid, but not sharp bounds that can even be completely noninformative. We investigate the properties of the bounds by simulating random probability distributions under our causal model and illustrate how they are interpreted in a real data example.

On the use of flexible excess hazard regression models for describing long-term breast cancer survival: a case-study using population-based cancer registry data	BMC CANCER			English	Article						Breast cancer; Prognostic factors; Treatment; Excess hazard model; Sensitivity analyses; Cancer registry	NET SURVIVAL; TIME; TRENDS; EVENTS; EUROPE; CURE	Background: Breast cancer prognosis has dramatically improved over 40 years. There is, however, no proof of population 'cure'. This research aimed to examine the pattern of long-term excess mortality due to breast cancer and evaluate its determinants in the context of cancer registry data. Methods: We used data from the Geneva Cancer Registry to identify women younger than 75 years diagnosed with invasive, localised and operated breast cancer between 1995 and 2002. Flexible modelling of excess mortality hazard, including time-dependent (TD) regression parameters, was used to estimate mortality related to breast cancer. We derived a single "final" model using a backward selection procedure and evaluated its stability through sensitivity analyses using a bootstrap technique. Results: We analysed data from 1574 breast cancer women including 351 deaths (22.3%). The model building strategy retained age at diagnosis (TD), tumour size and grade (TD), chemotherapy and hormonal treatment (TD) as prognostic factors, while the sensitivity analysis on bootstrap samples identified nodes involvement and hormone receptors (TD) as additional long-term prognostic factors but did not identify chemotherapy and hormonal treatment as important prognostic factors. Conclusions: Two main issues were observed when describing the determinants of long-term survival. First, the modelling strategy presented a lack of robustness, probably due to the limited number of events observed in our study. The second was the misspecification of the model, probably due to confounding by indication. Our results highlight the need for more detailed data and the use of causal inference methods.

Vitamin D has anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, anti-oxidative, and immunomodulatory effects. Whether vitamin D levels are correlated with endometriosis is a subject of ongoing debate. This study aimed to examine the association between endometriosis and serum vitamin D levels. From the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, this study examined the cross-sectional data of American women aged 20-54 years from 2001 to 2006. After adjusting for covariates, multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess correlations. A total of 3,232 women were included in this study. The multiple linear regression model demonstrated a negative correlation between the serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) concentration and the risk of endometriosis after controlling for all confounding variables. The odds ratio was 0.73 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.54-0.97 in the adequate vitamin D level group compared with the insufficient vitamin D level group. Our results showed that endometriosis was inversely correlated with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 levels. Further research is needed to establish a causal relationship and determine the potential benefits of maintaining sufficient vitamin D levels for endometriosis prevention.

In such studies, matching in the manner presented may be superior to other methods of analysis in removing bias due to confounding. A multivariate minimum-distance matching algorithm is used for computer selection of controls for the cases and the method is illustrated by application to a prospective cardiovascular disease study. The results are easy to understand and interpret, and there is no possibility of bias due to confounding variables when close matches are obtained. The results of multivariate analysis may be difficult to understand and interpret, and the removal of bias due to confounding is dependent on the assumptions of the model. The matching method should be used in addition to and at times instead of other methods of analysis whenever a study involves a relatively small number of cases and a large source of controls on whom relevant study variables have already been documented.

Theoretical Basis of the Test-Negative Study Design for Assessment of Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						causal inference; directed acyclic graphs; epidemiologic methods; influenza; observational studies; test-negative study design; vaccine effectiveness	PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINATION; CAUSAL DIAGRAMS; BIAS; RESPONSES; SELECTION; EFFICACY; DISEASE; MODELS; RISK; ASSOCIATION	Influenza viruses undergo frequent antigenic changes. As a result, the viruses circulating change within and between seasons, and the composition of the influenza vaccine is updated annually. Thus, estimation of the vaccine's effectiveness is not constant across seasons. In order to provide annual estimates of the influenza vaccine's effectiveness, health departments have increasingly adopted the "test-negative design," using enhanced data from routine surveillance systems. In this design, patients presenting to participating general practitioners with influenza-like illness are swabbed for laboratory testing; those testing positive for influenza virus are defined as cases, and those testing negative form the comparison group. Data on patients' vaccination histories and confounder profiles are also collected. Vaccine effectiveness is estimated from the odds ratio comparing the odds of testing positive for influenza among vaccinated patients and unvaccinated patients, adjusting for confounders. The test-negative design is purported to reduce bias associated with confounding by health-care-seeking behavior and misclassification of cases. In this paper, we use directed acyclic graphs to characterize potential biases in studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness using the test-negative design. We show how studies using this design can avoid or minimize bias and where bias may be introduced with particular study design variations.

Methods: This systematic review was conducted using the 2015 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The computerized bibliographic databases searched were Scopus, PubMed, and Google Schoolar. The included studies were rated using eight quality-appraisal criteria derived from the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) checklist: sample size, sampling methodology, response rate, outcome measures, statistical analyses, control for confounding, study limitation, and ethical consideration. As many as 12 of 5690 articles met our inclusion criteria for review. Results: The most consistent factors associated with childhood stunting were: low mother's education, increasing child's age, male sex, poor household, prolonged breastfeeding duration, low birth weight, mother's age (<20 years), drinking water source (unimproved), low mother's BMI (<18.5), diarrhoeal episode, low father's education and residence (rural). Conclusion: The factors that predispose a child to stunting are multifactors. Various factors causing stunting on children can be avoided through a holistic multi-strategy community-based approach.

REVUE D EPIDEMIOLOGIE ET DE SANTE PUBLIQUE			French	Article						air pollution; epidemiology; mortality; time series study	TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS; TEMPERATURE; SURVEILLANCE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; NETHERLANDS; INDICATORS; SYSTEM; FRANCE	Since 1990, many epidemiological time series studies have provided evidence that ambient air pollution levels have adverse health effects. The ERPURS study (Evaluation des Risques de la Pollution Urbaine pour a Sante) has permitted to quantify this impact in the Paris region. This study was based on art ecological time series approach. We present step by step, the method used, illustrated by an example: association between SO2 levels and total mortality (excluding external causes), 1987-1990. Mortality modelling has taken trend into account by a linear term, seasons by trigonometrics functions sum, day of the week effects by 6 dummy variables, temperature peak by a dummy variable, influenza epidemics by appropriate variables, mean temperature by linear and quadratic terms, relative humidity by a linear term. SO2 1 day lag was introduced in the model by a linear term. The central issue is the control of seasonal variations and long term trend. Art inadequate control can lead to some spurious results. The relationship between mortality and weather variables is generally nonlinear. The use of statistical and graphical diagnostics, are necessary at each step. Time series analysis are important tools to study short term relationship between air pollutants and health indicators. The method applied in the ERPURS study is only one of the possible approaches. Whatever the method used, it is important to understand the underlying process of the data and to control for confounding factors with the appropriate method for the temporal structure of the data.

The Bayesian predictive approach also circumvents problems related to frequentist estimators under the nonregular estimation problem. However, the model-based approach is susceptible to misspecification, in particular of the null-paradox type, which is due to the model parameters not having a direct causal interpretation in the presence of latent individual-level characteristics. Because it is reasonable to insist on correct inferences under the null of no difference between the alternative treatment regimes, we discuss how to achieve this through a null-robust reparametrization of the problem in a longitudinal setting. Since we argue that causal inference can be entirely understood as posterior predictive inference in a hypothetical population without covariate imbalances, we also discuss how controlling for confounding through inverse probability of treatment weighting can be justified and incorporated in the Bayesian setting.

Consequently, estimation of nursing intervention effect can be biased as in other observational studies. Propensity score analysis is an effective statistical method to reduce such bias and further derive causal effects in observational studies. Objectives: The objective of this study was to illustrate the use of propensity score analysis in quantitative nursing research through an example of pain management effect on length of hospital stay. Methods: Propensity scores are generated through a regression model treating the nursing intervention as the dependent variable and all confounding covariates as predictor variables. Then, propensity scores are used to adjust for this non-randomized assignment of nursing intervention through three approaches: regression covariance adjustment, stratification, and matching in the predictive outcome model for nursing intervention. Results: Propensity score analysis reduces the confounding covariates into a single variable of propensity score. After stratification and matching on propensity scores observed covariates between nursing intervention groups are more balanced within each stratum or in the matched samples. The likelihood of receiving pain management is accounted for in the outcome model through the propensity scores. Both regression covariance adjustment and matching methods report a significant pain management effect on length of hospital stay in this example. The pain management effect can be regarded as causal when the strongly ignorable treatment assignment assumption holds. Discussion: Propensity score analysis provides an alternative statistical approach to the classical multivariate regression, stratification, and matching techniques for examining the effects of nursing intervention with a large number of confounding covariates in the background. It can be used to derive causal effects of nursing intervention in observational studies under certain circumstances.

Instantaneous preference was a stronger instrumental variable than 3-and 6-month prescribing preference for NSAIDs	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Confounding factors (epidemiology); Bias (epidemiology); Models, statistical; Pharmacoepidemiology; Anti-inflammatory agents; non-steroidal; Cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors	TRIALS	Objective: Prescriber preference has been used as an instrumental variable (IV) in a prior study of nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) vs. selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, with preference expressed as the drug constituting the immediately preceding prescription by the same prescriber (instantaneous preference). We sought to compare the correlations between different IV measures with exposure. Study Design and Setting: In an ambulatory electronic medical record database of university-based physicians, we compared correlations with exposure among three measures of prescriber preference: instantaneous preference, and the proportion of that prescriber's prescriptions in the past 3 and 6 months that were for an NSAID. Results: We identified 37,934 initial NSAID/COX-2 prescriptions. The correlation with exposure was 0.283 (95% confidence interval 0.274-0.292) for instantaneous preference, 0.197 (0.187-0.206) for 3-month preference, and 0.170 (0.160-0.180) for 6-month preference. Conclusion: Instantaneous NSAID/COX-2 prescribing preference was most strongly correlated, and therefore the strongest IV. Future research should focus on the robustness of IV methods to violations of underlying assumptions, extension of IV methods to more than two groups, ratio measures of association, second and subsequent prescriptions per person, and time-varying exposures.

These studies can be confounded by treatment patterns or influenced by choice of outcome and time horizon. Interpretation can be complicated by uncertainty about when mortality differences might be expected. The authors examined these issues in an ecologic analysis of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening and prostate cancer mortality across nine cancer registries in the United States. Results suggested a weak trend for areas with greater PSA screening rates to have greater declines in prostate cancer mortality; however, the magnitude of this trend varied considerably with the time horizon and outcome measure. A computer model was used to determine whether divergence of mortality declines would be expected under an assumption of a clinically significant survival benefit due to screening. Given a mean lead time of 5 years, the model projected that differences in mortality between high- and low-use areas should be apparent by 1999 in the absence of other factors affecting mortality. The authors concluded that modest differences in PSA screening rates across areas, together with additional sources of variation, could have produced a negative ecologic result. Ecologic analyses of the effectiveness of PSA testing should be interpreted with caution.

Randomized controlled trials are considered the gold standard in assessing treatment efficacy and safety. However, their results can have limited external validity when applied to day-to-day patients. Pharmacoepidemiological studies aim to assess the effect/s of treatments in actual practice conditions, but they are limited by the quality, completeness, and inherent bias due to confounding. Sources of information include prospectively collected (primary) as well as readily available routinely collected (secondary) (eg, electronic medical records, administrative/claims databases) data. Although the former enable the collection of ad hoc measurements, the latter provide a unique opportunity for the study of large representative populations and for the assessment of rare events at relatively low cost. Observational cohort and case-control studies, the most commonly implemented study designs in pharmacoepidemiology, each have their strengths and limitations. However, the choice of the study design depends on the research question that needs to be answered. Despite the many advantages of observational studies, they also have limitations. First, missing data is a common issue in routine data, frequently dealt with using multiple imputation. Second, confounding by indication arises because of the lack of randomization; multivariable regression and more specific techniques such as propensity scores (adjustment, matching, stratification, trimming, or weighting) are used to minimize such biases. In addition, immortal time bias (time period during which a subject is artefactually event-free by study design) and time-varying confounding (patient characteristics changing over time) are other types of biases usually accounted for using time-dependent modeling. Finally, residual "uncontrolled" confounding is difficult to assess, and hence to account for it, sensitivity analyses and specific methods (eg, instrumental variables) should be considered.

Biased effects of pre-diagnostic physical activity on breast cancer survival: Systematic review and meta-analysis	CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Physical activity; Breast cancer survival; Bias; Systematic review; Meta-analysis	LONG-TERM; MORTALITY; WOMEN; ASSOCIATION; DIAGNOSIS; RECURRENCE; OBESITY; HEALTH; COHORT; RISK	Background: Pre-diagnostic physical activity is reported to improve survival for women with breast cancer. However, studies of pre-diagnostic exposures and cancer survival are susceptible to bias, made clear when applying a target trial framework. We investigated the impact of selection bias, immortal time bias, confounding and bias due to inappropriate adjustment for post-exposure variables in a systematic review and meta-analysis of pre-diagnostic physical activity and survival after breast cancer. Methods: Medline, Embase and Emcare were searched from inception to November 2021 for studies examining pre-diagnostic physical activity and overall or breast cancer-specific survival for women with breast cancer. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing highest versus lowest pre-diagnostic physical activity. Subgroup meta-analyses were used to compare HRs of studies with and without different biases. ROBINS-E was used to assess risk of bias. Results: We included 22 studies. Women with highest versus lowest pre-diagnostic physical activity had higher overall and breast cancer-specific survival across most analyses. The overall risk of bias was high. We observed marked differences in estimated HRs between studies that did and did not adjust for post-exposure variables or have immortal time bias. All studies were at risk of selection bias due to participants becoming eligible for study when they have survived to post-exposure events (e.g., breast cancer diagnosis). Insufficient studies were available to investigate confounding. Conclusion: Biases can substantially change effect estimates. Due to misalignment of treatment assignment (before diagnosis), eligibility (survival to post-exposure events) and start of follow-up, bias is difficult to avoid. It is difficult to lend a causal interpretation to effect estimates from studies of pre-diagnostic physical activity and survival after cancer. Biased effect estimates that are difficult to interpret may be less useful for clinical or public health policy applications.	[Wang, Ziyu; Albers, Frances E.

Further similarities have been observed in correlations between measures of brain function, including attention and executive abilities, and these personality psychopathologies. However, two methodologic factors might account for the covariation of these 'schizophrenia spectrum' personality traits and measures of brain function. Clinical selection bias (Berkson's bias) might result in subjects with overlapping conditions being more likely to be studied, and normal personality attributes could affect performance on neurobehavioral tasks. This study investigated relationships between neurobehavioral correlates of schizophrenia, clinical schizophrenia spectrum personality traits, and normal personality dimensions in the five-factor model of personality. To avoid Berkson's bias, subjects expected to have a high probability of spectrum traits were recruited from the Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area Survey community sample. About 40% of the sample were found to have DSM-IIIR Schizotypal, Schizoid, or Paranoid Personality Traits or Disorders. Schizophrenia Spectrum traits showed significant associations with personality dimensions of the five factor model, particularly Openness to Experience and Neuroticism. In ordinary linear regression models, after adjustment for a number of normal personality characteristics, Schizotypal Personality Traits were still strongly associated with perseverative responses on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). In logistic regression models, subjects with Schizotypal, Schizoid, or Paranoid Traits differed in terms of normal personality profiles and WCST performance.

EMPRISE is a study programme on the effectiveness, safety and healthcare utilization of empagliflozin in routine care, leveraging real-world data from two commercial and one federal US data sources from 2014 to 2019. Objectives: To describe rationale and design of EMPRISE, assess ability to minimize confounding and evaluate the time to reach sufficient statistical power for a key study outcome, HHF, using baseline information from the first year of EMPRISE. Methods:In 3 claims data sets, we identified a 1:1 propensity score (PS)-matched cohort of diabetic patients >= 18 years initiating empagliflozin or a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP4i), resulting in 6643 total pairs. The PS model included >140 baseline covariates. We measured covariate balance via standardized differences (SD) and postmatching c-statistic. We computed the incidence rate (IR) of HHF, predicted exposure accrual over time and calculated expected power. Results: After PS matching, patient characteristics were balanced with SD <0.1 and c-statistic between 0.54 and 0.59. The population IR of HHF was 4.4 per 1000 person-years using a specific HHF definition and 14.8 using a broader HHF definition. In our projection, 80%-powered analyses would require a minimum of 169 HHF events, expected to accumulate by year 3 (specific definition) or year 2 (broader definition). Conclusion: Baseline information from EMPRISE provided evidence of solid confounding control and adequate exposure accrual with expected powered analyses for the primary outcomes.

J	GREENBERG, GN; DEMENT, JM				GREENBERG, GN; DEMENT, JM			EXPOSURE ASSESSMENT AND GENDER DIFFERENCES	JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Womens Health: Occupation and Cancer	NOV 01-02, 1993	BALTIMORE, MD	NIEHS, NIH, OFF RES WOMENS HLTH, NIOSH, CTR DIS CONTROL & PREVENT, NCI			STATISTICAL-MODEL; RATS; RISK	Exposure assessments for occupational epidemiological studies are typically conducted to (1) establish risk gradients with exposure, evaluating a potential causal relationship, or (2) estimate exposure-response dosimetry for quantitative risk calculations. Unavailable quantitative exposure data require use of surrogate or qualitative measures. Differences in women's employment patterns may make surrogate measures less reliable, resulting in systematic errors. Exposures associated with traditionally female careers have not been fully evaluated. Occupational cohorts are often defined to include workers with a minimum employment duration or employment for some minimum time in exposure-related jobs, thereby excluding many women workers. Even when included among studied and exposed worker cohorts, women's domestic exposures may confound risk evaluation. Male/female differences in xenobiotic uptake, distribution, kinetics, and metabolism may affect the relationship between external exposure and resulting biologically effective dose. Clinical factors alter the recognition of disease among women workers, confounding risk determination. Recognizing these problems during design and analysis of occupational cancer epidemiology research is essential to develop valid preventive strategies.

Real-world evidence (RWE), the understanding of treatment effectiveness in clinical practice generated from longitudinal patient-level data that the routine operation of the healthcare system produces, complements evidence from randomized, controlled trials (RCTs).Objectives. The aim of this contribution is to highlight how robust and actionable RWE is generated.Methods. Best practices were condensed into a comprehensive yet concise guide.Results. Conducting RWE studies follows a structured approach: (1) A design layer connects the research question with the appropriate study design, (2) a measurement layer transforms the longitudinal patient-level data stream into variables that identify the study population, the pre-exposure patient characteristics, the treatment, and outcomes, and (3) an analysis layer focuses on the causal treatment effect estimation.Conclusions. RWE, if properly conducted, is a useful complement to randomized trial evidence.

Purpose: We reviewed analytic strategies to account for the total (observed and unobserved factors) contribution of environmental context to health inequalities, including conventional fixed effects (FE) and hybrid FE implemented within a random effects (RE) or a marginal model. Methods: To illustrate results and limitations of the various analytic approaches of accounting for the total contextual component of health disparities, we used data on births nested within neighborhoods as an applied example of evaluating neighborhood confounding of racial disparities in gestational age at birth, including both a continuous and a binary outcome. Results: Ordinary and RE models provided disparity estimates that can be substantially biased in the presence of neighborhood confounding. Both FE and hybrid FE models can account for cluster level confounding and provide disparity estimates unconfounded by neighborhood, with the latter having greater flexibility in allowing estimation of neighborhood-level effects and intercept/slope variability when implemented in a RE specification. Conclusions: Given the range of models that can be implemented in a hybrid approach and the frequent goal of accounting for contextual confounding, this approach should be used more often.

The motivation for this problem is that large datasets may contain numerous associations that are statistically significant and yet misleading, as they are induced by confounders or sampling imperfections. However, associations replicated under different conditions may be more interesting. In fact, sometimes consistency provably leads to valid causal inferences even if conditional associations do not. Although the proposed method is widely applicable, in this paper we highlight its relevance to genome-wide association studies, in which robustness across populations with diverse ancestries mitigates confounding due to unmeasured variants. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by simulations and applications to UK Biobank data.

A Comparison of Standard Methods With G-estimation of Accelerated Failure-time Models to Address The Healthy-worker Survivor Effect <i>Application in a Cohort of Autoworkers Exposed to Metalworking Fluids</i>	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							LONG-TERM EXPOSURE; AUTOMOBILE-INDUSTRY; CONFOUNDING FACTORS; CANCER INCIDENCE; MORTALITY; SELECTION; DEATH; RISK; BIAS	Background: Studies of autoworkers exposed to straight metalworking fluids report excess risks of several cancers. These studies, however, have not addressed the healthy-worker survivor effect. Most methods proposed to address this bias do not consider that it may be caused by time-varying confounders affected by prior exposure. G-estimation of accelerated failure-time models was developed to handle this issue but has never been applied to account for the healthy-worker survivor effect. Methods: We compare results from Cox models and g-estimation in 38,747 autoworkers exposed to straight metalworking fluids. Exposure was defined based on job records and air samples. We examine relationships between duration of exposure and mortality from all causes, cancers, ischemic heart disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Results: In standard models, hazard ratios were elevated for cancers of the larynx, prostate, and rectum, but below or approximately equal to 1.0 for all other outcomes considered. Adjustment for the healthy-worker survivor effect using time off work, employment status, time since hire, and restriction to inactive workers after 15 years of follow-up did not substantially change the hazard ratios. However, g-estimation yielded higher hazard ratios than standard Cox models for most outcomes. Exposure was related to increased risks of mortality from all causes combined, heart disease, COPD, and all cancers, as well as lung and prostate cancers. Conclusions: G-estimation may provide a better control for the healthy-worker survivor effect than standard methods.

Study Design and Settings: Different methods for determining minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) are reviewed, applied to practical examples (pain score differences in knee osteoarthritis), and further developed. Their characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages are illustrated and discussed. Results: Empirical score differences between verum and placebo become statistically significant if sample sizes are sufficiently large. MCIDs, by contrast, are defined by patients' perceptions. MCIDs obtained by the most common "mean change method" can be expressed as absolute or relative scores, as different ES parameters, and as the optimal cutoff point on the receiver operating characteristic curve. They can further be modeled by linear and logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders. Conclusion: Absolute and relative MCIDs are easy to interpret and apply to data of investigative studies. MCIDs expressed as effect sizes reduce bias, which mainly results from dependency on the baseline score. Multivariate linear and logistic regression modeling further reduces bias. Anchor-based methods use clinical/subjective perception to define MCIDs and should be clearly differentiated from distribution-based methods that provide statistical significance only.

But limited independent replicates, lack of experimental randomization, and space- and time-varying confounding handicap causal inference on effects of nutrient pollution. In this article, the causal g-methods are extended to allow for exposures to vary in time and space in order to assess the effects of nutrient pollution on chlorophyll a-a proxy for algal production. Publicly available data from North Carolina's Cape Fear River and a simulation study are used to show how causal effects of upstream nutrient concentrations on downstream chlorophyll a levels may be estimated from typical water quality monitoring data. Estimates obtained from the parametric g-formula, a marginal structural model, and a structural nested model indicate that chlorophyll a concentrations at Lock and Dam 1 were influenced by nitrate concentrations measured 86 to 109 km upstream, an area where four major industrial and municipal point sources discharge wastewater. for this article, including a standardized description of the materials available for reproducing the work, are available as an online supplement.

This question is concerned with the total causal effect of the timing of alcohol initiation on the timing of marijuana initiation. Unfortunately, when observational data are used to address a question such as the above, alternative explanations for the observed relationship between the predictor, here timing of alcohol initiation, and the response abound. These alternative explanations are due to the presence of confounders. Adjusting for confounders when using observational data is a particularly challenging problem when the predictor and confounders are time-varying. When time-varying confounders are present, the standard method of adjusting for confounders may fail to reduce bias and indeed can increase bias. In this paper, an intuitive and accessible graphical approach is used to illustrate how the standard method of controlling for confounders may result in biased total causal effect estimates. The graphical approach also provides an intuitive justification for an alternate method proposed by James Robins [Robins, J. M. (1998). 1997 Proceedings of the American Statistical Association, section on Bayesian statistical science (pp. 1 - 10). Retrieved from http://www.biostat.harvard.edu/robins/research.html; Robins, J. M., Hernan, M., & Brumback, B. (2000). Epidemiology, 11( 5), 550 - 560]. The above two methods are illustrated by addressing the motivating question. Implications for prevention researchers who wish to estimate total causal effects using longitudinal observational data are discussed.

Mendelian randomization can minimize confounding if variables are randomly and equally distributed in the population of interest. OBJECTIVE To assess evidence from mendelian randomization studies to provide a less biased estimate of any association between obesity and cardiovascular outcomes. DATA SOURCES Systematic searches of MEDLINE and Scopus from database inception until January 2018, supplemented with manual searches of the included reference lists. STUDY SELECTION Studies that used mendelian randomization methods to assess the association between any measure of obesity and the incidence of cardiovascular events and those that reported odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs estimated using an instrumental variable methodwere included. The 5 studies included in the final analysis were based on a consensus among 3 authors. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Two investigators independently extracted study characteristics using a standard form and pooled data using a random-effects model. The Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) reporting guideline was followed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Obesity associated with type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, or stroke. The hypothesis was formulated prior to data collection. RESULTS Of 4660 potentially relevant articles, 2511 titles were screened. Seven studies were included in the systematic review, and 5 studies with 881 692 participants were eligible to be included in the meta-analysis. Pooled estimates revealed that obesity was significantly associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes (OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.30-2.14; P < .001; I-2 = 93%) and coronary artery disease (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.02-1.41; P =.03; I-2 = 87%). No association between obesity and stroke was found (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.95-1.09; P = .65; I-2 = 0%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The present meta-analysis suggests that obesity is associated with type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease. Although this analysis of mendelian randomization studies does not prove causality, it is supportive of a causal association. Hence, health care practitioners should continue to emphasize weight reduction to combat coronary artery disease.

Individualized treatment rules: Generating candidate clinical trials	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						causal inference; longitudinal data; dynamic treatment regime; adaptive treatment strategy; history-adjusted marginal structural model; human immunodeficiency virus	CAUSAL INFERENCE; MODELS	Individualized treatment rules, or rules for altering treatments over time in response to changes in individual covariates, are of primary importance in the practice of clinical medicine. Several statistical methods aim to estimate the rule, termed an optimal dynamic treatment regime, which will result in the best expected outcome in a population. In this article, we discuss estimation of an alternative type of dynamic regime-the statically optimal treatment rule. History-adjusted marginal structural models (HA-MSM) estimate individualized treatment rules that assign, at each time point, the first action of the future static treatment plan that optimizes expected outcome given a patient's covariates. However, as we discuss here, HA-MSM-derived rules can depend on the way in which treatment was assigned in the data from which the rules were derived. We discuss the conditions sufficient for treatment rules identified by HA-MSM to be statically optimal, or in other words, to select the optimal future static treatment plan at each time point, regardless of the way in which past treatment was assigned. The resulting treatment rules form appropriate candidates for evaluation using randomized controlled trials. We demonstrate that a history-adjusted individualized treatment rule is statically optimal if it depends on a set of covariates that are sufficient to control for confounding of the effect of past treatment history on outcome. Methods and results are illustrated using an example drawn from the antiretroviral treatment of patients infected with HIV. Specifically, we focus on rules for deciding when to modify the treatment of patients infected with resistant virus. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Free HIV Antiretroviral Therapy Enhances Adherence among Individuals on Stable Treatment: Implications for Potential Shortfalls in Free Antiretroviral Therapy	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; BARRIERS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; KAMPALA; UGANDA; ADULTS; HAART; TIME	Objective: To estimate the population-level causal effect of source of payment for HIV medication on treatment adherence using Marginal Structural Models. Methods: Data were obtained from an observational cohort of 76 HIV-infected individuals with at least 24 weeks of antiretroviral therapy treatment from 2002 to 2007 in Kampala, Uganda. Adherence was the primary outcome and it was measured using the 30-day visual analogue scale. Marginal structural models (MSM) were used to estimate the effect of source of payment for HIV medication on adherence, adjusting for confounding by income, duration on antiretroviral therapy (ART), timing of visit, prior adherence, prior CD4(+) T cell count and prior plasma HIV RNA. Traditional association models were also examined and the results compared. Results: Free HIV treatment was associated with a 3.8% improvement in adherence in the marginal structural model, while the traditional statistical models showed a 3.1-3.3% improvement in adherence associated with free HIV treatment. Conclusion: Removing a financial barrier to treatment with ART by providing free HIV treatment appears to significantly improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy. With sufficient information on confounders, MSMs can be used to make robust inferences about causal effects in epidemiologic research.

Mixed membership trajectory models of cognitive impairment in the multicenter AIDS cohort study	AIDS			English	Article						dementia; epidemiology; HIV; HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder	HIV-1-INFECTED HOMOSEXUAL-MEN; RISK-FACTORS; NEUROCOGNITIVE DISORDER; TREATED HIV/AIDS; HIV-INFECTION; PERFORMANCE; DISABILITY; DEMENTIA; VIRUS; DEATH	Objective: The longitudinal trajectories that individuals may take from a state of normal cognition to HIV-associated dementia are unknown. We applied a novel statistical methodology to identify trajectories to cognitive impairment, and factors that affected the 'closeness' of an individual to one of the canonical trajectories. Design: The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) is a four-site longitudinal study of the natural and treated history of HIV disease among gay and bisexual men. Methods: Using data from 3892 men (both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected) enrolled in the neuropsychology substudy of the MACS, a Mixed Membership Trajectory Model (MMTM) was applied to capture the pathways from normal cognitive function to mild impairment to severe impairment. MMTMs allow the data to identify canonical pathways and to model the effects of risk factors on an individual's 'closeness' to these trajectories. Results: First, we identified three distinct trajectories to cognitive impairment: 'normal aging' (low probability of mild impairment until age 60); 'premature aging' (mild impairment starting at age 45-50); and 'unhealthy' (mild impairment in 20s and 30s) profiles. Second, clinically defined AIDS, and not simply HIV disease, was associated with closeness to the premature aging trajectory, and, third, hepatitis-C infection, depression, race, recruitment cohort and confounding conditions all affected individual's closeness to these trajectories. Conclusion: These results provide new insight into the natural history of cognitive dysfunction in HIV disease and provide evidence for a potential difference in the pathophysiology of the development of cognitive impairment based on trajectories to impairment.

In this article, we consider the consequences on noncollapsibility of a sample selection related to a relevant outcome-risk factor. Methods: We focused on the odds ratio and defined the noncollapsibility effect as the difference between the marginal and the conditional (with respect to the outcome-risk factor) exposure-outcome association. We consider a situation in which the aims of the study require the estimate of a conditional effect. Results: Using a classical numerical example, which assumes that all variables are binary and that the outcome-risk factor is not an effect modifier, we illustrate that in the selected sample the noncollapsibility effect can either be larger or smaller than in the population-based study, according to whether the selection moves the prevalence of the risk factor closer to or away from 50%. When the outcome-risk factor is also a confounder, the magnitude of the noncollapsibility effect in the selected sample depends on the effects of the selection on both noncollapsibility and confounding. Conclusions: When a key outcome-risk factor is unmeasured, in presence of noncollapsibility neither a population-based nor a selected study can directly estimate the conditional effect; whether the computable marginal is closer to the conditional in the selected or in the population-based study depends on the underlying population and the selection process.

Lipid-lowering drugs may be used to prevent and treat OP. However, the causal interpretation of results from traditional observational designs is controversial by confounding. We aimed to investigate the causal association between genetically proxied lipid-lowering drugs and OP risk.Methods: We conducted two-step Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses to investigate the causal association of genetically proxied lipid-lowering drugs on the risk of OP. The first step MR was used to estimate the associations of drug target genes expression with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. The significant SNPs in the first step MR were used as instrumental variables in the second step MR to estimate the associations of LDL-C levels with forearm bone mineral density (FA-BMD), femoral neck BMD (FN-BMD), lumbar spine BMD (LS-BMD) and fracture. The significant lipid-lowering drugs after MR analyses were further evaluated for their effects on bone mineralization using a dexamethasone-induced OP zebrafish model.Results: The first step MR analysis found that the higher expression of four genes (HMGCR, NPC1L1, PCSK9 and PPARG) was significantly associated with a lower LDL-C level. The genetically decreased LDL-C level mediated by the PPARG was significantly associated with increased FN-BMD (BETA = -1.38, p = 0.001) and LS-BMD (BETA = -2.07, p = 3.35 x 10(-5)) and was marginally significantly associated with FA-BMD (BETA = -2.36, p = 0.008) and reduced fracture risk (OR = 3.47, p = 0.008). Bezafibrate (BZF) and Fenofibric acid (FBA) act as PPARG agonists. Therefore genetically proxied BZF and FBA had significant protective effects on OP. The dexamethasone-induced OP zebrafish treated with BZF and FBA showed increased bone mineralization area and integrated optical density (IOD) with alizarin red staining.Conclusion: The present study provided evidence that BZF and FBA can increase BMD, suggesting their potential effects in preventing and treating OP. These findings potentially pave the way for future studies that may allow personalized selection of lipid-lowering drugs for those at risk of OP.

SAS and R code for probabilistic quantitative bias analysis for misclassified binary variables and binary unmeasured confounders	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Bias analysis; epidemiologic methods; bias; systematic error	SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS	Systematic error from selection bias, uncontrolled confounding, and misclassification is ubiquitous in epidemiologic research but is rarely quantified using quantitative bias analysis (QBA). This gap may in part be due to the lack of readily modifiable software to implement these methods. Our objective is to provide computing code that can be tailored to an analyst's dataset. We briefly describe the methods for implementing QBA for misclassification and uncontrolled confounding and present the reader with example code for how such bias analyses, using both summary-level data and individual record-level data, can be implemented in both SAS and R. Our examples show how adjustment for uncontrolled confounding and misclassification can be implemented. Resulting bias-adjusted point estimates can then be compared to conventional results to see the impact of this bias in terms of its direction and magnitude. Further, we show how 95% simulation intervals can be generated that can be compared to conventional 95% confidence intervals to see the impact of the bias on uncertainty. Having easy to implement code that users can apply to their own datasets will hopefully help spur more frequent use of these methods and prevent poor inferences drawn from studies that do not quantify the impact of systematic error on their results.

In order to correct these two types of bias and offer protection against model mis-specification, a multiply robust estimator is proposed, which allows multiple candidate models to be taken account into estimation. The proposed estimator is consistent when any pair of models for propensity score and selection probability is correctly specified, or any model for outcome regression is correctly specified. Under regularity conditions, asymptotic normality of the estimator is obtained. Moreover, the proposed estimator achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound when the correct models for propensity score, selection probability and outcome regression are included in the candidate models simultaneously. Finite-sample performance of the proposed method is evaluated via simulations and an empirical study.

However, METS-IR has not been investigated in relation to all-cause mortality. We investigated the longitudinal effect of METS-IR on all-cause mortality in a significantly large cohort of Korean adults over 60 years old.Methods Data were assessed from 30,164 Korean participants over 60 years of age from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study-Health Examinees (KoGES-HEXA) cohort data, linked with the death certificate database of the National Statistical Office. The participants were grouped into three according to METS-IR tertiles. We used multivariate Cox proportional-hazard regression models to prospectively assess hazard ratios (HRs) for all-cause mortality with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) over an 11-year postbaseline period.Results During the mean 11.7 years of follow-up, 2,821 individuals expired. The HRs of mortality for METS-IR tertiles were 1.16 (95% CI, 1.01-1.34) in T3 after adjustment for metabolic parameters, but the T2 did not show statistical significance towards increases for incident mortality respectively. In subgroup analysis depending on the cause of mortality, higher METS-IR was associated with cancer mortality (HR, 1.23, 95% CI, 1.01-1.51) but not with cardiovascular mortality (HR, 1.14, 95% CI, 0.83-1.57) after adjustment for the same confounding variables.Conclusion The METS-IR may be a useful predictive marker for all-cause mortality and cancer mortality, but not for cardiovascular mortality in subjects over 60 years of age. This implies that early detection and intervention strategies for metabolic syndrome could potentially benefit this identified group.

John			Alcohol misuse and violent behavior: Findings from a 30-year longitudinal study	DRUG AND ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE			English	Article						Alcohol abuse/dependence; Violence; Substance use; Mental health; Longitudinal study	INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE; CONSUMPTION; DRINKING; HEALTH; PREVALENCE; ABUSE; ONSET; AGE; DEPENDENCE; DISCRETE	Background: This study examined the associations between measures of alcohol abuse/dependence (AAD) and violent offending and intimate partner violence (IPV) to age 30 in a New Zealand birth cohort. Methods: Outcomes included: measures of violent offending, violence victimization, and physical IPV perpetration and victimization. The study also used measures of AAD symptoms; and time-dynamic covariate factors including life stress, other substance use, mental health status, peer and partner substance use and offending, and unemployment. Data were analysed using conditional fixed effects regression modelling augmented by time-dynamic covariate factors to control for confounding. Results: Those with five or more AAD symptoms had unadjusted rates of violence outcomes that ranged from 4.10 to 11.85 times higher than those with no symptoms, but these associations did not differ by gender. Adjustment of the associations for both unobserved fixed effects and time-dynamic covariate factors reduced the magnitude of the associations for violent offending, violence victimization and IPV perpetration, with those with five or more AAD symptoms having rates of violence outcomes that were 1.91-3.58 times higher than those with no symptoms. However, control for both fixed effects and time-dynamic covariate factors reduced the associations between AAD symptoms and physical IPV victimization to statistical non-significance (IRR = 0.73, 95% Cl: 0.51-1.06). Conclusions: The results suggest a causal association between alcohol misuse and violent offending/victimization and IPV perpetration, with estimates suggesting that alcohol use disorder accounted for approximately 4.6-9.3% of the reported violent offending/victimization and IPV perpetration in the cohort.

J	Zhou, YJ; Matsouaka, RA; Thomas, L				Zhou, Yunji; Matsouaka, Roland A.; Thomas, Laine			Propensity score weighting under limited overlap and model misspecification	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Propensity score; limited overlap; model misspecification; overlap weights; inverse probability weights; trimming	CAUSAL INFERENCE; ROBUSTNESS; POSITIVITY	Propensity score weighting methods are often used in non-randomized studies to adjust for confounding and assess treatment effects. The most popular among them, the inverse probability weighting, assigns weights that are proportional to the inverse of the conditional probability of a specific treatment assignment, given observed covariates. A key requirement for inverse probability weighting estimation is the positivity assumption, i.e. the propensity score must be bounded away from 0 and 1. In practice, violations of the positivity assumption often manifest by the presence of limited overlap in the propensity score distributions between treatment groups. When these practical violations occur, a small number of highly influential inverse probability weights may lead to unstable inverse probability weighting estimators, with biased estimates and large variances. To mitigate these issues, a number of alternative methods have been proposed, including inverse probability weighting trimming, overlap weights, matching weights, and entropy weights. Because overlap weights, matching weights, and entropy weights target the population for whom there is equipoise (and with adequate overlap) and their estimands depend on the true propensity score, a common criticism is that these estimators may be more sensitive to misspecifications of the propensity score model. In this paper, we conduct extensive simulation studies to compare the performances of inverse probability weighting and inverse probability weighting trimming against those of overlap weights, matching weights, and entropy weights under limited overlap and misspecified propensity score models. Across the wide range of scenarios we considered, overlap weights, matching weights, and entropy weights consistently outperform inverse probability weighting in terms of bias, root mean squared error, and coverage probability.

Socioeconomic factors measured directly at the individual level and site-specific malaria prevalence predicted for the Demographic and Health Surveys' locations by a spatial model fitted to the Mapping Malaria Risk in Africa database were examined as possible risk factors. The analysis was carried out by fitting a Bayesian hierarchical geostatistical logistic model to infant mortality risk, by Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. It confirmed that mother's education, birth order and interval, infant's sex, residence, and mother's age at infant's birth had a strong impact on infant mortality risk in Mali. The residual spatial pattern of infant mortality showed a clear relation to well-known foci of malaria transmission, especially the inland delta of the Niger River. No effect of estimated parasite prevalence could be demonstrated. Possible explanations include confounding by unmeasured covariates and sparsity of the source malaria data. Spatial statistical models of malaria prevalence are useful for indicating approximate levels of endemicity over wide areas and, hence, for guiding intervention strategies. However, at points very remote from those sampled, it is important to consider prediction error.

DURATION OF CIGARETTE SMOKING IS A STRONGER RISK FACTOR THAN NUMBER OF CIGARETTES SMOKED PER DAY FOR HEAD AND NECK CANCER, AND QUITTING DRAMATICALLY LOWERS THE RISK	JOURNAL OF EVIDENCE-BASED DENTAL PRACTICE			English	Editorial Material						Statistical models; Cigarette smoking; Head and neck neoplasms; Laryngeal neoplasms; Mouth neoplasms; Pharyngeal neoplasms		Study Selection The International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology (INHANCE) pooled data project included invasive cancer cases of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, oral cavity or pharynx not otherwise specified, larynx, or unspecified head and neck cancer from 35 case-control studies conducted throughout the United States, Latin America, Europe, and Asia (25,865 cases and 37,248 controls). The present study included data from 33 case-control studies and was limited to subjects with complete data on duration (ie, number of years) and intensity (ie, number of cigarettes smoked per day) of cigarette smoking. It excluded persons who used other forms of combusted tobacco, studies that excluded former smokers, and cases with unspecified or overlapping head and neck cancer. The final sample included 48,104 subjects (18,260 cases and 29,844 controls). Key Study Factors The two key study factors were the duration of smoking (years of exposure) and the intensity of smoking (the number of cigarettes smoked per day), measured jointly in bivariate spline models. That statistical modeling approach allows estimation of a surface that represents the risk associated with two continuous exposures (in this case, duration and intensity of smoking), separately and as an interaction. The joint effects were modeled separately for current and former smoking. The analysis for current smoking also was stratified by current intensity of alcoholic beverage consumption, and the analysis of former smoking was stratified by the number of years since quitting. Potential confounding factors were included in the models, including age, sex, race, study, education level, drinking status, drinking intensity, and drinking duration. Main Outcome Measure The main outcome measurers were adjusted odds ratio (OR) estimates associated with the full range of values of duration and intensity (excluding extreme outliers), presented as two-dimensional risk surfaces. Main Results Smoking duration modified the risk of oral or pharyngeal cancer at any level of smoking intensity, with a dose-response relationship. By contrast, for any duration up to 10 years, the adjusted OR estimates were always,2 regardless of the smoking intensity. For a fixed value of 20 pack-years, an intensity of 40 cigarettes per day and a duration of 10 years had an estimated OR of about 2, but a duration of 40 years and an intensity of 10 cigarettes per day had an estimated OR of about 4. OR estimates for oral or pharyngeal cancer reached a maximum of 10.6 in the bivariate spline models, at a duration of more than 36 years and intensity of about 40 cigarettes per day. The shape of the risk surface differed by level of alcohol consumption. For example, among persons who reported never drinking, the OR estimate exceeded 5 only for those with a smoking duration of more than 25 years and intensity of 30 or more cigarettes per day. By contrast, the OR estimates for oral or pharyngeal cancer among heavy drinkers ($5 drinks per day) exceeded 20 for persons with that same duration and intensity of smoking. The risks for laryngeal cancer were far greater than for oral or pharyngeal cancer at any level of smoking intensity or duration. For laryngeal cancer, OR estimates greater than 20 were found for intensities of greater than 20 cigarettes per day and durations of greater than 28 years. For a fixed value of 20 pack-years, the OR estimate for 40 cigarettes per day for a duration of 10 years was 6.2 but was greater than 9 for an intensity of 10 cigarettes per day and a duration of 40 years. OR estimates for oral or pharyngeal cancer reached a maximum of 43.2, at a duration of more than 36 years and intensity of about 40 cigarettes per day. Among former smokers who had quit at least 10 years before diagnosis or interview, the OR estimates for oral or pharyngeal cancer were approximately one-half and the OR estimates for laryngeal cancer were about two-thirds lower compared with the same levels of duration and intensity in current smokers. Conclusions Duration of smoking has a stronger effect on the risk of head and neck cancer than does the number of cigarettes smoked per day. At the highest combined levels of smoking duration and intensity, persons may reach OR estimates of > 10 for oral or pharyngeal cancer and > 40 for laryngeal cancer. Quitting smoking substantially reduces the risk of head and neck cancer.

We present a standardized approach to quantify the variability of results obtained with choices of adjustments called the "vibration of effects" (VoE). Study Design and Setting: We estimated the VoE for 417 clinical, environmental, and physiological variables in association with all-cause mortality using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data. We selected 13 variables as adjustment covariates and computed 8,192 Cox models for each of 417 variables' associations with all-cause mortality. Results: We present the VoE by assessing the variance of the effect size and in the -log10(P-value) obtained by different combinations of adjustments. We present whether there are multimodality patterns in effect sizes and P-values and the trajectory of results with increasing adjustments. For 31% of the 417 variables, we observed a Janus effect, with the effect being in opposite direction in the 99th versus the 1st percentile of analyses. For example, the vitamin E variant alpha-tocopherol had a VoE that indicated higher and lower risk for mortality. Conclusion: Estimating VoE offers empirical estimates of associations are under different model specifications. When VoE is large, claims for observational associations should be very cautious.

When the data to which the GAM are being applied have two characteristics-1) the estimated regression coefficients are small and 2) there exist confounding factors that are modeled using at least two nonparametric smooth functions-the default settings in the gam function of the S-Plus software package (version 3.4) do not assure convergence of its iterative estimation procedure and can provide biased estimates of regression coefficients and standard errors. This phenomenon has occurred in time-series analyses of contemporary data on air pollution and mortality. To evaluate the impact of default implementation of the gam software on published analyses, the authors reanalyzed data from the National Morbidity, Mortality, and Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS) using three different methods: 1) Poisson regression with parametric nonlinear adjustments for confounding factors; 2) GAM with default convergence parameters; and 3) GAM with more stringent convergence parameters than the default settings. The authors found that pooled NMMAPS estimates were very similar under the first and third methods but were biased upward under the second method.

Clinical trials have showed no relationship between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use and AD. The aim of this study was to establish if there is a causal link between RA and AD. A systematic literature review on RA incidence and its link to AD was carried out according to the PRISMA guidelines. Eight case-control and two population-based studies were included in a random effects meta-analysis. The causal relationship between RA and AD was assessed using Mendelian Randomization (MR), using summary data from the largest RA and AD Genome Wide Association (GWA) and meta-analysis studies to date using a score of 62 RA risk SNPs (p < 5 * 10(-8)) as instrumental variable (IV). Meta-analysis of the literature showed that RA was associated with lower AD incidence (OR=0.600, 95% CI 0.46-0.77, p=1.03 * 10(-4)). On the contrary, MR analysis did not show any evidence of a causal association between RA and AD (OR=1.012, 95% CI 0.98-1.04). Although there is epidemiological evidence for an association of RA with lower AD incidence, this association does not appear to be causal. Possible explanations for this discrepancy could include influence from confounding factors such as use of RA medication, selection bias and differential RA diagnosis.

We assess modifications to existing risk of bias approaches to incorporate rigorous quasi-experimental approaches with selection on unobservables. These are non-randomized studies using design-based approaches to control for unobservable sources of confounding such as difference studies, instrumental variables, interrupted time series, natural experiments, and regression-discontinuity designs. Study Design and Setting: We review existing risk of bias tools. Drawing on these tools, we present domains of bias and suggest directions for evaluation questions. Results: The review suggests that existing risk of bias tools provide, to different degrees, incomplete transparent criteria to assess the validity of these designs. The paper then presents an approach to evaluating the internal validity of quasi-experiments with selection on unobservables. Conclusion: We conclude that tools for nonrandomized studies of interventions need to be further developed to incorporate evaluation questions for quasi-experiments with selection on unobservables.

J	Austin, N; Harper, S; Strumpf, E				Austin, Nichole; Harper, Sam; Strumpf, Erin			Does Segregation Lead to Lower Birth Weight? <i>An Instrumental Variable Approach</i>	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							RACIAL RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION; AFRICAN-AMERICAN; INCOME INCONGRUITY; PREGNANCY OUTCOMES; FUNDAMENTAL CAUSE; HEALTH; DENSITY; NEIGHBORHOODS; PERSPECTIVE; DISPARITIES	Background: Racial residential segregation in the United States has been linked to racial differences in birth outcomes, with studies reporting associations between segregation and birth weight. However, this relationship is likely confounded, and many individual and neighborhood-level covariates included in previous models are likely mediators, potentially obscuring any causal impact of segregation on birth weight. Methods: We compiled a record of non-Hispanic black and white singleton births to US-born/resident mothers in 2000, linked to segregation indices at the metropolitan statistical area (MSA) level in the non-Southern US. Segregation was measured via the dissimilarity index. The outcomes were individual-level birth weight and the metropolitan statistical area-level black/white gap in birth weight. We instrumented for segregation using the railroad division index. We compared race-stratified ordinary least squares models to two-stage least squares models, with cluster robust standard errors. Results: We estimated a 1.2 g decrease in black birth weight for every one-percentage point increase in segregation (95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.9, -0.50) via ordinary least squares but a 2.8 g decrease (95% CI: -6.0, 0.48) using two-stage least squares. For white infants, our ordinary least squares estimate was 0.53 (95% CI: -0.23, 1.3), and our two-stage least squares estimate was in the opposite direction (-0.68, 95% CI: -3.5, 2.1). Conclusions: Ordinary least squares estimates may understate the effect of segregation on birth weight in blacks. Evidence from instrumental variable models was consistent with a causal impact of segregation on black birth outcomes, but estimates were imprecise and may be affected by weak instrument bias.

TB delay, consisting of patient delay, diagnostic delay, treatment delay, increases the risk of adverse anti-TB treatment (ATT) outcomes. Except for individual level variables, differences in regional levels have been shown to impact the ATT outcomes. However, few studies appropriately considered possible individual and regional level confounding variables. In this study, we aimed to assess the association of TB delay on treatment outcomes in HIV-TB co-infected patients in Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture (Liangshan Prefecture) of China, using a causal inference framework while taking into account individual and regional level factors.Methods We conducted a study to analyze data from 2068 patients with HIV-TB co-infection in Liangshan Prefecture from 2019 to 2022. To address potential confounding bias, we used a causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) to select appropriate confounding variables. Further, we controlled for these confounders through multilevel propensity score and inverse probability weighting (IPW).Results The successful rate of ATT for patients with HIV-TB co-infection in Liangshan Prefecture was 91.2%. Total delay (OR = 1.411, 95% CI: 1.015, 1.962), diagnostic delay (OR = 1.778, 95% CI: 1.261, 2.508), treatment delay (OR = 1.749, 95% CI: 1.146, 2.668) and health system delay (OR = 1.480 95% CI: (1.035, 2.118) were identified as risk factors for successful ATT outcome. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of these findings.Conclusions HIV-TB co-infection prevention and control policy in Liangshan Prefecture should prioritize early treatment for diagnosed HIV-TB co-infected patients. It is urgent to improve the health system in Liangshan Prefecture to reduce delays in diagnosis and treatment.

Long-term cost-effectiveness of interventions for obesity: A mendelian randomisation study	PLOS MEDICINE			English	Article							BARIATRIC SURGERY; IDENTIFICATION; ADOLESCENTS; IMPUTATION; OUTCOMES; DESIGN; BIAS	Background The prevalence of obesity has increased in the United Kingdom, and reliably measuring the impact on quality of life and the total healthcare cost from obesity is key to informing the cost-effectiveness of interventions that target obesity, and determining healthcare funding. Current methods for estimating cost-effectiveness of interventions for obesity may be subject to confounding and reverse causation. The aim of this study is to apply a new approach using mendelian randomisation for estimating the cost-effectiveness of interventions that target body mass index (BMI), which may be less affected by confounding and reverse causation than previous approaches. Methods and findings We estimated health-related quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and both primary and secondary healthcare costs for 310,913 men and women of white British ancestry aged between 39 and 72 years in UK Biobank between recruitment (2006 to 2010) and 31 March 2017. We then estimated the causal effect of differences in BMI on QALYs and total healthcare costs using mendelian randomisation. For this, we used instrumental variable regression with a polygenic risk score (PRS) for BMI, derived using a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of BMI, with age, sex, recruitment centre, and 40 genetic principal components as covariables to estimate the effect of a unit increase in BMI on QALYs and total healthcare costs. Finally, we used simulations to estimate the likely effect on BMI of policy relevant interventions for BMI, then used the mendelian randomisation estimates to estimate the cost-effectiveness of these interventions. A unit increase in BMI decreased QALYs by 0.65% of a QALY (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.49% to 0.81%) per year and increased annual total healthcare costs by 42.23 pound (95% CI: 32.95 pound to 51.51) pound per person. When considering only health conditions usually considered in previous cost-effectiveness modelling studies (cancer, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes), we estimated that a unit increase in BMI decreased QALYs by only 0.16% of a QALY (95% CI: 0.10% to 0.22%) per year. We estimated that both laparoscopic bariatric surgery among individuals with BMI greater than 35 kg/m(2), and restricting volume promotions for high fat, salt, and sugar products, would increase QALYs and decrease total healthcare costs, with net monetary benefits (at 20,000 pound per QALY) of 13,936 pound (95% CI: 8,112 pound to 20,658) pound per person over 20 years, and 546 pound million (95% CI: 435 pound million to 671 pound million) in total per year, respectively. The main limitations of this approach are that mendelian randomisation relies on assumptions that cannot be proven, including the absence of directional pleiotropy, and that genotypes are independent of confounders. Conclusions Mendelian randomisation can be used to estimate the impact of interventions on quality of life and healthcare costs. We observed that the effect of increasing BMI on health-related quality of life is much larger when accounting for 240 chronic health conditions, compared with only a limited selection. This means that previous cost-effectiveness studies have likely underestimated the effect of BMI on quality of life and, therefore, the potential cost-effectiveness of interventions to reduce BMI.

Serum bilirubin and the risk of hypertension	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Bilirubin; blood pressure; direct acyclic graphs; antioxidants; reactive oxygen species; multiple imputation; sensitivity analysis; NHANES	CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE RISK; FLOW-MEDIATED VASODILATION; ISCHEMIC-HEART-DISEASE; NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE; C-REACTIVE PROTEIN; URIC-ACID LEVEL; BLOOD-PRESSURE; ENDOTHELIAL DYSFUNCTION; PSYCHOSOCIAL STRESS; GILBERT-SYNDROME	Background: Experimental studies suggest oxidative stress could lead to the development of hypertension. Serum bilirubin is a major contributor to the antioxidant capacity in blood plasma and has been identified as an independent cardiovascular risk factor in cohort studies. However, data on the relationship between bilirubin and blood pressure are scarce and inconclusive. Methods: We analysed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) 1999-2012 (N = 31 069). Fifty multiple imputed data sets were generated and analysed to avoid selection/confounding bias due to excluding individuals/variables with missing values. A minimal sufficient adjustment set of variables (MSAS) needed to estimate the unconfounded effect of bilirubin on blood pressure and hypertension (systolic/diastolic blood pressure >= 140/90mmHg or using antihypertensive medication) was identified using the back-door criterion and included in all regression models. Results: After adjustment for the MSAS variables, systolic blood pressure decreased progressively up to - 2.5mmHg (p< 0.001) and the prevalence of hypertension was up to 25% lower (P< 0.001) in those with bilirubin >= 1.0 mg/dl-the highest two deciles-compared with those with 0.1-0.4mg/dl-the lowest decile. Sensitivity analyses showed these results were unlikely to be explained by residual confounding or selection bias. Conclusions: High serum bilirubin may decrease the risk of hypertension by inactivating and inhibiting the synthesis of reactive oxygen species in vascular cells. Strategies to boost the bioavailability of circulating and tissue bilirubin or to mimic bilirubin's antioxidant properties could have a significant impact on prevention and control of hypertension as well as coronary heart disease.

Intraoperative CT for lumbar fusion is not associated with improved short- or long-term complication profiles	SPINE JOURNAL			English	Article						Complications; Intraoperative CT; Intraoperative Navigation; O -arm; Revisions; Spondylolisthesis	COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; SURGERY; PLACEMENT; ACCURACY	BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The use of intraoperative CT has continued to grow in recent years, as various techniques leverage the promise of improved instrumentation accuracy and the hope for decreased complications. Nonetheless, the literature regarding the short-and long-term complications associated with such techniques remains scant and/or confounded by indication and selection bias.PURPOSE: To use causal inference techniques to determine whether intraoperative CT use is associated with an improved complication profile as compared to conventional radiography for single-level lumbar fusions, an increasingly commonplace application for this technology.STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Inverse probability weighted retrospective cohort study carried out within a large integrated health care network.PATIENT SAMPLE: Adult patients who underwent surgical treatment of spondylolisthesis via lumbar fusion from January 2016 to December 2021.OUTCOME MEASURES: Our primary outcome was the incidence rate of revision surgery. Our secondary outcome was the incidence of composite 90-day complications (deep and superficial sur-gical site infection, venous thromboembolic events, and unplanned readmissions).METHODS: Demographics, intraoperative information, and postoperative complications were abstracted from electronic health records. A propensity score was developed utilizing a parsimoni-ous model to account for covariate interaction with our primary predictor, intraoperative imaging technique. This propensity score was utilized in the creation of inverse probability weights to adjust for indication and selection bias. The rate of revisions within 3 years as well as the rate of revisions at any time-point were compared between cohorts using Cox regression analysis. The incidence of composite 90-day complications were compared using negative binomial regression.RESULTS: Our patient population consisted of 583 patients, with 132 who underwent intraopera-tive CT and 451 who underwent conventional radiographic techniques. There were no significant differences between cohorts following inverse probability weighting. No significant differences were detected in 3-year revision rates (HR, 0.74 [95% CI 0.29, 1.92]; p=.5), overall revision rates (HR, 0.54 [95% CI 0.20, 1.46]; p=.2), or 90-day complications (RC-0.24 [95% CI -1.35, 0.87]; p=.7).CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative CT use was not associated with an improved complication profile in either the short-or long-term for patients undergoing single-level instrumented fusion. This observed clinical equipoise should be weighed against resource and radiation-related costs when considering intraoperative CT for low complexity fusions. (c) 2023 Elsevier Inc.

J	Cologne, J; Langholz, B				Cologne, J; Langholz, B			Selecting controls for assessing interaction in nested case-control studies	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						nested case-control studies; matching; counter matching; models; statistical; atomic-bomb survivor studies	BOMB SURVIVORS; EFFICIENCY; MODELS; CANCER	Background: Two methods for selecting controls in nested case-control studies - matching on X and counter matching on X - are compared when interest is in interaction between a risk factor X measured in the full cohort and another risk factor Z measured only in the case-control sample. This is important because matching provides efficiency gains relative to random sampling when X is uncommon and the interaction is positive (greater than multiplicative), whereas counter matching is generally efficient compared to random sampling. Methods: Matching and counter matching were compared to each other and to random sampling of controls for dichotomous X and Z Comparison was by simulation, using as an example a published study of radiation and other risk factors for breast cancer in the Japanese atomic-bomb survivors, and by asymptotic relative efficiency calculations for a wide range of parameters specifying the prevalence of X and Z as well as the levels of correlation and interaction between them. Focus was on analyses utilizing general models for the joint risk of X and Z Results: Counter-matching performed better than matching or random sampling in terms of efficiency for inference about interaction in the case of a rare risk factor X and uncorrelated risk factor Z Further, more general, efficiency calculations demonstrated that counter-matching is generally efficient relative to matched case-control designs for studying interaction. Conclusions: Because counter-matched designs may be analyzed using standard statistical methods and allow investigation of confounding of the effect of X, whereas matched designs require a non-standard approach when fitting general risk models and do not allow investigating the adjusted risk of X, it is concluded that counter-matching on X can be a superior alternative to matching on X in nested case-control studies of interaction when X is known at the time of case-control sampling.

We aimed at evaluating MSMs, in accounting for confounding when assessing the benefit of intensive care unit (ICU) admission and on its interaction with patient age, as compared with propensity score (PS) matching. Study Design and Setting: PS and inverse-probability-of-treatment weights for MSMs were derived from an observational study designed to evaluate the benefit of ICU admission on in-hospital mortality. Only first ICU triages (time-fixed weights) or whole triage history (time-dependent weights) were considered. Weights were stabilized by either the prevalence of the actual treatment or the probability of the actual treatment given baseline covariates. Risk difference (RD) was the main outcome measure. Results: MSMs with time-dependent weights offered the best reduction in the baseline imbalances as compared with PS matching. No effect of ICU admission on in-hospital mortality was found (RD = 0.010; 95% confidence interval = -0.038, 0.052) with no interaction between age and treatment. Conclusion:: MSMs appear interesting to handle selection bias in observational studies. When confounding evolves over time, the use of time-dependent weights should be stressed out.

Joint estimation of time-dependent and non-linear effects of continuous covariates on survival	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Cox proportional hazards model; time-dependent effects; non-linear effects; regression splines; over-parameterization; hypothesis testing; model selection; residual confounding; bias	CUBIC SPLINE FUNCTIONS; REGRESSION-MODELS; HAZARD REGRESSION; RATIO	in order to yield more flexible models, the Cox regression model, lambda(t;x) = lambda(0)(t) exp(beta x), has been generalized using different non-parametric model estimation techniques. One generalization is the relaxation of log-linearity in x, lambda(t;x)=lambda(0)(t)exp[r(x)]. Another is the relaxation of the proportional hazards assumption, lambda(t;x)=lambda(0)(t)exp[beta(t)x]. These generalizations are typically considered independently of each other. We propose the product model, lambda(t;x)=lambda(0)(t) exp[beta(t)r(x)] which allows for joint estimation of both effects, and investigate its properties. The functions describing the time-dependent 1 (t) and non-linear r(x) effects are modelled simultaneously using regression splines and estimated by maximum partial likelihood. Likelihood ratio tests are proposed to compare alternative models. Simulations indicate that both the recovery of the shapes of the two functions and the size of the tests are reasonably accurate provided they are based on the correct model. By contrast, type I error rates may be highly inflated, and the estimates considerably biased, if the model is misspecified. Applications in cancer epidemiology illustrate how the product model may yield new insights about the role of prognostic factors. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Simpson's paradox: A statistician's case study	EMERGENCY MEDICINE AUSTRALASIA			English	Editorial Material						discrimination; epidemiology; statistics		Gender equality and workforce diversity has recently been in the forefront of College discussions. Reasons for the difference between various groups may not be as they initially appeared. The results of comparing the outcome between two groups can sometimes be confounded and even reversed by an unrecognised third variable. This concept is known as Simpson's Paradox, and is illustrated here using a renowned case study on potential gender bias for acceptance to Graduate School at the University of California, Berkeley. The investigation showed that males were 1.8 times more likely to be admitted to Graduate School than females in 1973. Initially it appeared that women were discriminated against in the selection process. However, when admissions were re-examined at individual Departments of the School, admission tended to be better for women than men in four of six Departments. This contradiction or paradox tells us that the association between admission and gender was dependent upon on Department. The confounding effect of Department was defined by two characteristics. Firstly, a strong association between Department and admission: some Departments admitted much smaller percentages of applicants than others. Secondly, a strong association between Department and gender: females tended to apply to Departments with lower admission rates. The explanation of differences between groups can be multifactorial. A search for possible confounders will assist in this understanding. This could apply whenever two groups initially appear to differ, but on closer analysis this difference is either unfounded, or even reversed by reference to a third, confounding variable.

The "within-pair" estimates acquired through these comparisons are free from confounding from all factors that are shared by the siblings. This has made sibling comparisons popular in studying associations thought likely to suffer confounding from socioeconomic or genetic factors. Despite the wide application of these designs in epidemiology, they have received little scrutiny from a statistical or methodological standpoint. In this paper we show, analytically and through a series of simulations, that the standard interpretation of the models is subject to several limitations that are rarely acknowledged. Although within-pair estimates will not be confounded by factors shared by the siblings, such estimates are more severely biased by non-shared confounders than the unpaired estimate. If siblings are less similar with regard to confounders than to the exposure under study, the within-pair estimate will always be more biased than the ordinary unpaired estimate. Attenuation of associations due to random measurement error in exposure will also be higher in the within-pair estimate, leading within-pair associations to be weaker than corresponding unpaired associations, even in the absence of confounding. Implications for the interpretation of sibling comparison results are discussed.

This systematic review summarises the association between infant (ages 0-12 months) gut microbiota composition measured by genomic sequencing, and childhood (ages 0-18 years) respiratory diseases (ie, respiratory infections, wheezing, or asthma). Overall, there was evidence that low a-diversity and relative abundance of particular gut-commensal bacteria genera (Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus, and Roseburia) are associated with childhood respiratory diseases. However, results were inconsistent and studies had important limitations, including insufficient characterisation of bacterial taxa to species level, heterogeneous outcome definitions, residual confounding, and small sample sizes. Large longitudinal studies with stool sampling during the first month of life and shotgun metagenomic approaches to improve bacterial and fungal taxa resolution are needed. Standardising follow-up times and respiratory disease definitions and optimising causal statistical approaches might identify targets for primary prevention of childhood respiratory diseases.

However, they have not been previously adapted to deal with bias in genetic association studies. We propose an extension of our previous method (Zhao et al., 2009) that uses a multilevel propensity score approach and allows one to estimate the effect of a genotype under an additive model and also simultaneously adjusts for confounders such as genetic ancestry and patient and disease characteristics. Using simulation studies, we demonstrate that this extended genetic propensity score (eGPS) can adequately adjust and consistently correct for bias due to confounding in a variety of circumstances. Under all simulation scenarios, the eGPS method yields estimates with bias close to 0 (mean=0.018, standard error=0.01). Our method also preserves statistical properties such as coverage probability, Type I error, and power. We illustrate this approach in a population-based genetic association study of testicular germ cell tumors and KITLG and SPRY4 susceptibility genes. We conclude that our method provides a novel and broadly applicable analytic strategy for obtaining less biased and more valid estimates of genetic associations.

Adjusting a relative-risk estimate for study imperfections	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article							SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; MODEL FORM; CONGENITAL-MALFORMATIONS; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; OBSERVATIONAL DATA; SYSTEMATIC-ERRORS; RESPONSE BIAS; MISCLASSIFICATION; SIMULATION; SELECTION	A statistical analysis combines data with assumptions to yield a quantitative result that is a function of both. One goal of an epidemiological analysis, then, should be to combine data with good assumptions. Unfortunately, a typical quantitative epidemiological analysis combines data with an assumption for which there is neither theoretical nor empirical justification. The assumption is that study imperfections (eg residual confounding, subject losses, non-random subject sampling, subject non-response, exclusions because of missing data, measurement error, incorrect statistical assumptions) have no important impact on study results. The author explains how a typical epidemiological analysis implicitly makes this assumption. It is then shown how in a quantitative analysis the assumption can be replaced with a better one. A simple, everyday example to illustrate the fundamental concepts is used to begin with. The relationship between an observed relative risk, the true causal relative risk and error terms that describe the impact of study imperfections on study results is described mathematically. This mathematical description can be used to quantitatively adjust a relative-risk estimate for the combined effect of study imperfections.

Accounting for motion in resting-state fMRI: What part of the spectrum are we characterizing in autism spectrum disorder?	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Causal inference; Confounding; Functional connectivity; Missing data; Sampling bias; Super learner; Targeted minimum loss based estimation; Motion quality control; Autism spectrum disorder	GENDERED CITATION PATTERNS; FALSE DISCOVERY RATE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CAUSAL INFERENCE; HEAD MOTION; CONFOUND REGRESSION; SYMPTOM SEVERITY; CHILDREN; ARTIFACT; MRI	The exclusion of high-motion participants can reduce the impact of motion in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data. However, the exclusion of high-motion participants may change the distribution of clinically relevant variables in the study sample, and the resulting sample may not be representative of the population. Our goals are two-fold: 1) to document the biases introduced by common motion exclusion practices in functional connectivity research and 2) to introduce a framework to address these biases by treating excluded scans as a missing data problem. We use a study of autism spectrum disorder in children without an intellectual disability to illustrate the problem and the potential solution. We aggregated data from 545 children (8-13 years old) who participated in resting-state fMRI studies at Kennedy Krieger Institute (173 autistic and 372 typically developing) between 2007 and 2020. We found that autistic children were more likely to be excluded than typically developing children, with 28.5% and 16.1% of autistic and typically developing children excluded, respectively, using a lenient criterion and 81.0% and 60.1% with a stricter criterion. The resulting sample of autistic children with usable data tended to be older, have milder social deficits, better motor control, and higher intellectual ability than the original sample. These measures were also related to functional connectivity strength among children with usable data. This suggests that the generalizability of previous studies reporting naive analyses (i.e., based only on participants with usable data) may be limited by the selection of older children with less severe clinical profiles because these children are better able to remain still during an rs-fMRI scan. We adapt doubly robust targeted minimum loss based estimation with an ensemble of machine learning algorithms to address these data losses and the resulting biases. The proposed approach selects more edges that differ in functional connectivity between autistic and typically developing children than the naive approach, supporting this as a promising solution to improve the study of heterogeneous populations in which motion is common.

Are Early-Life Socioeconomic Conditions Directly Related to Birth Outcomes? Grandmaternal Education, Grandchild Birth Weight, and Associated Bias Analyses	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						bias (epidemiology); birth weight; early life; grandmaternal education; marginal structural models; socioeconomic status	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; SOCIAL EPIDEMIOLOGY; CHILD-DEVELOPMENT; AMERICAN WOMEN; BLOOD-PRESSURE; HEALTH; STRESS; RISK; INTERVENTION	Grandmaternal education may be related to grandchild birth weight (GBW) through maternal early-life development; however, conventional regression models may be endogenously confounded. Alternative models employing explicit structural assumptions may provide incrementally clearer evidence. We used data from the US National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (1995-2009; 1,681 mother-child pairs) to estimate "direct effects" of grandmaternal educational level (less than high school, high school diploma or equivalent, or college degree) at the time of the mother's birth on GBW, adjusted for maternal life-course factors: maltreatment as a child, education and income as an adult, prepregnancy overweight, and prenatal smoking. Using conventional and marginal structural model (MSM) approaches, we estimated 54-g (95% confidence interval: -14.0, 122.1) and 87-g (95% confidence interval: 10.9, 162.5) higher GBWs per increase in educational level, respectively. The MSM allowed simultaneous mediation by and adjustment for prepregnancy overweight. Estimates were insensitive to alternate structural assumptions and mediator parameterizations. Bias analysis suggested that a single unmeasured confounder would have to have a strong influence on GBW (approximately 150 g) or be greatly imbalanced across exposure groups (approximately 25%) to completely explain the findings. Coupling an MSM with sensitivity analyses provides some evidence that maternal early-life socioeconomic environment is directly associated with offspring birth weight.

Bicycle infrastructure and the incidence rate of crashes with cars: A case-control study with Strava data in Atlanta	JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT & HEALTH			English	Article						Bicycle infrastructure; Strava; Case-control studies; Bicycling safety; Atlanta; Georgia; Causal inference	CYCLE-TRACKS; SAFETY ANALYSIS; SIGNALIZED INTERSECTIONS; FATALITY RATES; INJURY RISK; MODE SHARE; TRAVEL; IMPACT; LANE	Introduction: Bicycling has individual and collective health benefits. Safety concerns are a deterrent to bicycling. Incomplete data on bicycling volumes has limited epidemiologic research investigating safety impacts of bicycle infrastructure, such as protected bike lanes. Methods: In this case-control study, set in Atlanta, Georgia, USA between 2016-10-01 and 201808-31, we estimated the incidence rate of police-reported crashes between bicyclists and motor vehicles (n = 124) on several types of infrastructure (off-street paved trails, protected bike lanes, buffered bike lanes, conventional bike lanes, and sharrows) per distance ridden and per intersection entered. To estimate underlying bicycling (the control series), we used a sample of highresolution bicycling data from Strava, an app, combined with data from 15 on-the-ground bicycle counters to adjust for possible selection bias in the Strava data. We used model-based standardization to estimate effects of treatment on the treated. Results: After adjustment for selection bias and confounding, estimated ratio effects on segments (excluding intersections) with protected bike lanes (incidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.5 [95% confidence interval: 0.0, 2.5]) and buffered bike lanes (IRR = 0 [0,0]) were below 1, but were above 1 on conventional bike lanes (IRR = 2.8 [1.2, 6.0]) and near null on sharrows (IRR = 1.1 [0.2, 2.9]). Per intersection entry, estimated ratio effects were above 1 for entries originating from protected bike lanes (incidence proportion ratio [IPR] = 3.0 [0.0, 10.8]), buffered bike lanes (IPR = 16.2 [0.0, 53.1]), and conventional bike lanes (IPR = 3.2 [1.8, 6.0]), and were near 1 and below 1, respectively, for those originating from sharrows (IPR = 0.9 [0.2, 2.1]) and off-street paved trails (IPR = 0.7 [0.0, 2.9]). Conclusions: Protected bike lanes and buffered bike lanes had estimated protective effects on segments between intersections but estimated harmful effects at intersections. Conventional bike lanes had estimated harmful effects along segments and at intersections.	[Garber, Michael D.; Flanders, W.

A Nationwide Swedish Family-Based Study of 2.4 Million Individuals	SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN			English	Article						schizophrenia; urbanization; socioeconomic factors; multilevel models; confounding factors; quasiexperimental designs	URBAN-RURAL DIFFERENCES; CONFOUNDERS; ASSOCIATION; ENVIRONMENT; DISORDERS; PSYCHOSIS	People living in densely populated and socially disorganized areas have higher rates of psychiatric morbidity, but the potential causal status of such factors is uncertain. We used nationwide Swedish longitudinal registry data to identify all children born 1967-1989 (n = 2361585), including separate datasets for all cousins (n = 1715059) and siblings (n = 1667894). The nature of the associations between population density and neighborhood deprivation and individual risk for a schizophrenia diagnosis was investigated while adjusting for unobserved familial risk factors (through cousin and sibling comparisons) and then compared with similar associations for depression. We generated familial pedigree structures using the Multi-Generation Registry and identified study participants with schizophrenia and depression using the National Patient Registry. Fixed-effects logistic regression models were used to study within-family estimates. Population density, measured as ln(population size/km(2)), at age 15 predicted subsequent schizophrenia in the population (OR = 1.10; 95% CI: 1.09; 1.11). Unobserved familial risk factors shared by cousins within extended families attenuated the association (1.06; 1.03; 1.10), and the link disappeared entirely within nuclear families (1.02; 0.97; 1.08). Similar results were found for neighborhood deprivation as predictor and for depression as outcome. Sensitivity tests demonstrated that timing and accumulation effects of the exposures (mean scores across birth, ages 1-5, 6-10, and 11-15 years) did not alter the findings. Excess risks of psychiatric morbidity, particularly schizophrenia, in densely populated and socioeconomically deprived Swedish neighborhoods appear, therefore, to result primarily from unobserved familial selection factors. Previous studies may have overemphasized the etiological importance of these environmental factors.

Assessing the disease severity caused by newly emerging variants is essential to estimate their impact on public health. However, causally inferring the intrinsic severity of infection with variants using observational data is a challenging process on which guidance is still limited. We describe potential limitations and biases that researchers are confronted with and evaluate different methodological approaches to study the severity of infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants. Methods We reviewed the literature to identify limitations and potential biases in methods used to study the severity of infection with a particular variant. The impact of different methodological choices is illustrated by using real-world data of Belgian hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Results We observed different ways of defining coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease severity (e.g., admission to the hospital or intensive care unit versus the occurrence of severe complications or death) and exposure to a variant (e.g., linkage of the sequencing or genotyping result with the patient data through a unique identifier versus categorization of patients based on time periods). Different potential selection biases (e.g., overcontrol bias, endogenous selection bias, sample truncation bias) and factors fluctuating over time (e.g., medical expertise and therapeutic strategies, vaccination coverage and natural immunity, pressure on the healthcare system, affected population groups) according to the successive waves of COVID-19, dominated by different variants, were identified. Using data of Belgian hospitalized COVID-19 patients, we were able to document (i) the robustness of the analyses when using different variant exposure ascertainment methods, (ii) indications of the presence of selection bias and (iii) how important confounding variables are fluctuating over time. Conclusions When estimating the unbiased marginal effect of SARS-CoV-2 variants on the severity of infection, different strategies can be used and different assumptions can be made, potentially leading to different conclusions. We propose four best practices to identify and reduce potential bias introduced by the study design, the data analysis approach, and the features of the underlying surveillance strategies and data infrastructure.

Extensions to nonlinear models have been considered but lack formal justification. By placing mediation analysis within the counterfactual framework of causal inference one can define causal mediation effects in a way that is not tied to a specific statistical model and identify them under certain no unmeasured confounding assumptions. Corresponding estimation procedures using parametric or nonparametric models, based on the so-called mediation formula, have recently been proposed in the psychological literature and made accessible through the R-package mediation. A number of limitations of the latter approach are discussed and a more flexible approach using natural effects models is proposed as an alternative. The latter builds on the same counterfactual framework but enables interpretable and parsimonious modeling of direct and mediated effects and facilitates tests of hypotheses that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to test. We illustrate the approach in a study of individuals who ended a romantic relationship and explore whether the effect of attachment anxiety during the relationship on unwanted pursuit behavior after the breakup is mediated by negative affect during the breakup.

Reevaluating Cumulative HIV-1 Viral Load as a Prognostic Predictor: Predicting Opportunistic Infection Incidence and Mortality in a Ugandan Cohort	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Cox proportional hazards models; HIV; human immunodeficiency virus; Martingale residuals; mortality; opportunistic infections; viral load; viremia copy-years	VIREMIA COPY-YEARS; ACTIVE ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; IMMUNE RECONSTITUTION; TRANSMISSION; ADULTS; DETERMINANTS; INFLAMMATION; INITIATION; HIV/AIDS; CHILDREN	Recent studies have evaluated cumulative human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) viral load (cVL) for predicting disease outcomes, with discrepant results. We reviewed the disparate methodological approaches taken and evaluated the prognostic utility of cVL in a resource-limited setting. Using data on the Infectious Diseases Institute (Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda) cohort, who initiated antiretroviral therapy in 2004-2005 and were followed up for 9 years, we calculated patients' time-updated cVL by summing the area under their viral load curves on either a linear scale (cVL(1)) or a logarithmic scale (cVL(2)). Using Cox proportional hazards models, we evaluated both metrics as predictors of incident opportunistic infections and mortality. Among 489 patients analyzed, neither cVL measure was a statistically significant predictor of opportunistic infection risk. In contrast, cVL(2) (but not cVL(1)) was a statistically significant predictor of mortality, with each log(10) increase corresponding to a 1.63-fold (95% confidence interval: 1.02, 2.60) elevation in mortality risk when cVL(2) was accumulated from baseline. However, whether cVL is predictive or not hinges on difficult choices surrounding the cVL metric and statistical model employed. Previous studies may have suffered from confounding bias due to their focus on cVL(1), which strongly correlates with other variables. Further methodological development is needed to illuminate whether the inconsistent predictive utility of cVL arises from causal relationships or from statistical artifacts.

Dietary Intakes of Vegetable Protein, Folate, and Vitamins B-6 and B-12 Are Partially Correlated with Physical Functioning of Dutch Older Adults Using Copula Graphical Models	JOURNAL OF NUTRITION			English	Article						copula graphical models; nutrient networks; muscle health; physical functioning; older adults; sarcopenta	LOWER-EXTREMITY FUNCTION; RESISTANCE EXERCISE; ELDERLY-PEOPLE; GAIT SPEED; LEAN MASS; NUTRIENT INTAKE; MUSCLE MASS; HOMOCYSTEINE; ASSOCIATION; PERFORMANCE	Background: In nutritional epidemiology, dealing with confounding and complex internutrient relations are major challenges. An often-used approach is dietary pattern analyses, such as principal component analysis, to deal with internutrient correlations, and to more closely resemble the true way nutrients are consumed. However, despite these improvements, these approaches still require subjective decisions in the preselection of food groups. Moreover, they do not make efficient use of multivariate dietary data, because they detect only marginal associations. We propose the use of copula graphical models (CGMs) to model and make statistical inferences regarding complex associations among variables in multivariate data, where associations between all variables can be learned simultaneously. Objective: We aimed to reconstruct nutritional intake and physical functioning networks in Dutch older adults by applying a CGM. Methods: We addressed this issue by uncovering the pairwise associations between variables while correcting for the effect of remaining variables. More specifically, we used a CGM to infer the precision matrix, which contains all the conditional independence relations between nodes in the graph. The nonzero elements of the precision matrix indicate the presence of a direct association. We applied this method to reconstruct nutrient-physical functioning networks from the combined data of 4 studies (Nu-Age, ProMuscle, ProMO, and V-Fit, total n = 662, mean +/- SD age = 75 +/- 7 y). The method was implemented in the R package nutriNetwork which is freely available at https: //cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nutriNetwork. Results: Greater intakes of vegetable protein and vitamin B-6 were partially correlated with higher scores on the total Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and the chair rise test. Greater intakes of vitamin B-12 and folate were partially correlated with higher scores on the chair rise test and the total SPPB, respectively. Conclusions: We determined that vegetable protein, vitamin B-6, folate, and vitamin B-12 intakes are partially correlated with improved functional outcome measurements in Dutch older adults.

Caesarean section and subsequent ectopic pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis	BJOG-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY			English	Review						Caesarean; ectopic pregnancy; meta-analysis; systematic review	RISK-FACTORS; URINARY-INCONTINENCE; MATERNAL DEATH; UNITED-STATES; POPULATION; DELIVERY; TRENDS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MODES; WOMEN	Background Caesarean section rates are increasing worldwide, and the long-term effects are unknown. Objective To evaluate the risk of subsequent ectopic pregnancy in women with a previous caesarean section, compared with vaginal delivery. Search strategy Systematic review of the literature using CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Embase, Medline, PubMed, SCOPUS and Web of Knowledge, published from 1945 until 17 July 2011. Selection criteria Cohort and casecontrol designs reporting on the mode of delivery and subsequent ectopic pregnancy. Two reviewers independently assessed the titles, abstracts, and full articles to identify eligible studies, using a standardised data collection form, and also assessed the study quality. Reference lists of the studies included were also cross-checked. Data collection and analysis Odds ratios (ORs) were combined using a random-effect model to estimate the overall association between caesarean section delivery and the risk of subsequent ectopic pregnancy. Main results Thirteen studies were included, which recruited a total of 61978 women. Five studies reported adjustment for confounding factors, and the pooled OR of subsequent ectopic pregnancy following a caesarean section was 1.05 (95%CI 0.512.15). The removal of one study that reported outlier results yielded a pooled OR of 0.82 (95%CI 0.421.61). The pooled crude OR for all 13 studies was 1.36 (95%CI 0.991.88). Author's conclusions This review found no evidence of an association between prior caesarean section delivery and the occurrence of a subsequent ectopic pregnancy, but the studies included were of poor or variable quality, and only a small number adjusted for potential confounding factors. Further research of a higher methodological quality is required to assess any potential association between mode of delivery and subsequent ectopic pregnancy.	[O'Neill, S. M.; Greene, R.

Most pediatric osteosarcomas of the limbs undergo limb-salvage surgery. We aimed to use propensity score matching (PSM) analysis test the difference in cancer-specific mortality (CSM) between amputation and limb-salvage surgery in pediatric patients with Osteosarcoma of the limbs. PSM is a statistical method used to deal with data from an Observational Study. The PSM method is designed to reduce the influence of biases and confounding variables to make a more reasonable comparison between experimental and control groups. MethodsPatient information was downloaded from the SEER (surveillance, epidemiology, and End Results) database from 2004 to 2018. We included all primary pediatric osteosarcoma patients who underwent limb salvage or amputation. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to explore the factors influencing patient choice of amputation. Differences in CSM and other causes of mortality (OSM) between limb salvage and amputation were analyzed using cumulative incidence plots and competitive risk regression tests after 1:1 proportional propensity score matching. ResultsA total of 1,058 pediatric patients with limbs Osteosarcoma were included. Patients who underwent amputations were more likely to be male (OR 1.4, P = 0.024) and more likely to have distant metastasis (OR 2.1, P < 0.001). Before propensity matching, CSM was 1.4 times higher in patients undergoing amputation than in patients undergoing limb salvage (P = 0.017) and 3.4 times higher in OSM (P = 0.007). After adjustment for propensity matching, CSM was 1.5 times higher in patients undergoing amputation than in patients undergoing limb salvage (P = 0.028), but there was no significant difference in OSM (HR 3.2, P = 0.078). ConclusionsOur results suggested that amputation is associated with a 1.5-fold increase in CSM in pediatric patients with limbs Osteosarcoma. Therefore, in the surgical selection of pediatric patients with Osteosarcoma, limb salvage surgery should be the first choice in the absence of other contraindications.

J	Lee, S; Epstein, MP; Duncan, R; Lin, XH				Lee, Seokho; Epstein, Michael P.; Duncan, Richard; Lin, Xihong			Sparse Principal Component Analysis for Identifying Ancestry-Informative Markers in Genome-Wide Association Studies	GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						ancestry-informative markers; genome-wide association studies; population stratification; principal component analysis; variable selection	POPULATION STRATIFICATION; SEMIPARAMETRIC TEST; ADMIXTURE; PANEL; MAP	Genome-Wide association studies (GWAS) routinely apply principal component analysis (PCA) to infer population structure within a sample to correct for confounding due to ancestry. GWAS implementation of PCA uses tens of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to infer structure, despite the fact that only a small fraction of such SNPs provides useful information on ancestry. The identification of this reduced set of Ancestry-Informative markers (AIMs) from a GWAS has practical value; for example, researchers can genotype the AIM set to correct for potential confounding due to ancestry in follow-up studies that utilize custom SNP or sequencing technology. We propose a novel technique to identify AIMs from Genome-Wide SNP data using sparse PCA. The procedure uses penalized regression methods to identify those SNPs in a Genome-Wide panel that significantly contribute to the principal components while encouraging SNPs that provide negligible loadings to vanish from the analysis. We found that sparse PCA leads to negligible loss of ancestry information compared to traditional PCA analysis of Genome-Wide SNP data. We further demonstrate the value of sparse PCA for AIM selection using real data from the International HapMap Project and a Genome-Wide study of inflammatory bowel disease. We have implemented our approach in open-source R software for public use. Genet. Epidemiol. 36:293-302, 2012. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

However, the reason for this increased level of subclinical vascular disease is unknown. Objective: To identify HIV-related risk factors for increased cIMT. Methods: We evaluated the relationship between HIV-related characteristics (including markers of HIV disease severity and use of antiretroviral therapy) and cIMT measurements in the internal/bulb and common carotid regions among 538 HIV-infected participants from the Study of Fat Redistribution and Metabolic Change in HIV Infection (FRAM). We used Bayesian model averaging to estimate the posterior probability of candidate HIV and non-HIV-related risk factors being true predictors of increased cIMT. Variables with a posterior probability of more than 50% were used to develop a selected regression model for each of the anatomic regions. Results: For common cIMT, the Bayesian model selection process identified age, African-American race, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure with probability more than 95%, HDL cholesterol with probability 85% and Hispanic ethnicity with probability 51%. Among the HIV-related factors included in the analysis, only tenofovir use was selected (51% probability). In the selected model, duration of tenofovir use was associated with lower common cIMT (-0.0094 mm/year of use; 95% confidence interval: -0.0177 to -0.0010). For internal cIMT, no HIV-related risk factors were above the 50% posterior probability threshold. Conclusion: We observed an inverse association between duration of tenofovir use and common carotid cIMT. Whether this association is causal or due to confounding by indication needs further investigation. (C) 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health vertical bar Lippincott Williams & Wilkins	[Delaney, Joseph A.

Recent epidemiological evidence (Teo et al., 2006) suggests a more linear relation. This paper reexamines the empirical relation between self-reported low levels of active smoking and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in public-domain data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Consistent with biological evidence on J-shaped and U-shaped relations between smoking-associated risk factors and CHD risks, we find that low levels of active smoking do not appear to be associated with increased CHD risk. Several methodological challenges in epidemiology may explain how model-derived estimates can predict low-dose linear or concave dose-response estimates, even if the empirical (i.e., data-based) relation does not show a clear increased risk at the lowest doses.

When Can Nonrandomized Studies Support Valid Inference Regarding Effectiveness or Safety of New Medical Treatments?	CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS			English	Review							HEALTH-CARE DATABASE; PROPENSITY SCORE; VARIABLE SELECTION; BIAS; COHORT; REPRODUCIBILITY; ADJUSTMENT; THERAPY; BALANCE; TRIALS	The randomized controlled trial (RCT) is the gold standard for evaluating the causal effects of medications. Limitations of RCTs have led to increasing interest in using real-world evidence (RWE) to augment RCT evidence and inform decision making on medications. Although RWE can be either randomized or nonrandomized, nonrandomized RWE can capitalize on the recent proliferation of large healthcare databases and can often answer questions that cannot be answered in randomized studies due to resource constraints. However, the results of nonrandomized studies are much more likely to be impacted by confounding bias, and the existence of unmeasured confounders can never be completely ruled out. Furthermore, nonrandomized studies require more complex design considerations which can sometimes result in design-related biases. We discuss questions that can help investigators or evidence consumers evaluate the potential impact of confounding or other biases on their findings: Does the design emulate a hypothetical randomized trial design? Is the comparator or control condition appropriate? Does the primary analysis adjust for measured confounders? Do sensitivity analyses quantify the potential impact of residual confounding? Are methods open to inspection and (if possible) replication? Designing a high-quality nonrandomized study of medications remains challenging and requires broad expertise across a range of disciplines, including relevant clinical areas, epidemiology, and biostatistics. The questions posed in this paper provide a guiding framework for assessing the credibility of nonrandomized RWE and could be applied across many clinical questions.

In this article we demonstrate how to construct a TMLE that also satisfies the property that it is at least as efficient as a user supplied asymptotically linear estimator. In particular it is shown that this type of TMLE can incorporate empirical efficiency maximization as in Rubin and van der Laan (2008), Tan (2008, 2010), Rotnitzky et al. (2012). and retain double robustness. For the sake of illustration we focus on estimation of the additive average causal effect of a point treatment on an outcome, adjusting for baseline covariates.

Cross-linked survey analysis is an approach for separating cause and effect in survey research	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Self-matched studies; Epidemiologic research designs; Evaluation studies as topic; Intervention studies; Survey analysis; Outcome and process assessment	LONGITUDINAL DATA-ANALYSIS; TIME	Objectives: We developed a new research approach, called cross-linked survey analysis, to explore how an acute exposure might lead to changes in survey responses. The goal was to identify associations between exposures and outcomes while reducing some ambiguities related to interpreting cause and effect in survey responses from a population-based community questionnaire. Study Design and Setting: Cross-linked survey analysis differs from a cross-sectional, longitudinal, and panel survey analysis by individualizing the timeline to the unique history of each respondent. Cross-linked survey analysis, unlike a repeated-measures self-matching design, does not track changes in a repeated survey question given to the same respondent at multiple time points. Results: Pilot data from three analyses (n = 1,177 respondents) illustrate how a cross-linked survey analysis can control for population shifts, temporal trends, and reverse causality. Accompanying graphs provide an intuitive display to readers, summarize results, and show differences in response distributions. Population-based individual-level linkages also reduce selection bias and increase statistical power compared with a single-center cross-sectional survey. Cross-linked survey analysis has limitations related to unmeasured confounding, pragmatics, survivor bias, statistical models, and the underlying artifacts in survey responses. Conclusion: We suggest that a cross-linked survey analysis may help in epidemiology science using survey data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We used daily measurements for particulate matter less than 10 mum in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) and/or black smoke from 29 European cities. We considered confounding from other pollutants as well as meteorologic and chronologic variables. We investigated several variables describing the cities' pollution, climate, population, and geography as potential effect modifiers. For the individual city analysis, generalized additive models extending Poisson regression, using a smoother to control for seasonal patterns, were applied. To provide quantitative summaries of the results and explain remaining heterogeneity, we applied second-stage regression models. The estimated increase in the daily number of deaths for all ages for a 10 mug/m(3) increase in daily PM10 or black smoke concentrations was 0.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.4-0.8%], whereas for the elderly it was slightly higher. We found important effect modification for several of the variables studied. Thus, in a city with low average NO2, the estimated increase in daily mortality for an increase of 10 mug/m(3) in PM10 was 0.19 (95% CI = 0.00-0.41), whereas in a city with high average NO2 it was 0.80% (95% CI = 0.67-0.93%); in a relatively cold climate the corresponding effect was 0.29% (95% CI = 0.16-0.42), whereas in a warm climate it was 0.82% (95% CI = 0.69-0.96); in a city with low standardized mortality rate it was 0.80% (95% CI = 0.65-0.95%), and in one with a high rate it was 0.43% (95% CI = 0.24-0.62). Our results confirm those previously reported on the effects of ambient particles on mortality. Furthermore, they show that the heterogeneity found in the effect parameters among cities reflects real effect modification, which is explained by specific city characteristics.

Standard (default) MI procedures use simple linear covariate functions in the imputation model. We examine the bias that may be caused by accep-tance of this default option and evaluate methods to identify problematic imputation models, providing practical guidance for researchers. Study Design and Setting: Using simulation and real data analysis, we investigated how imputation model mis-specification affected MI performance, comparing results with complete records analysis (CRA). We considered scenarios in which imputation model mis-specification occurred because (i) the analysis model was mis-specified or (ii) the relationship between exposure and confounder was mis-specified. Results: Mis-specification of the relationship between outcome and exposure, or between exposure and confounder, can cause biased CRA and MI estimates (in addition to any bias in the full-data estimate due to analysis model mis-specification). MI by predictive mean matching can mitigate model mis-specification. Methods for examining model mis-specification were effective in identifying mis-specified relationships. Conclusion: When using MI methods that assume data are MAR, compatibility between the analysis and imputation models is neces-sary, but not sufficient to avoid bias. We propose a step-by-step procedure for identifying and correcting mis-specification of imputation models. & COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

Their joint effects are less well understood. Methods: We explored the role of air pollution in modifying the effects of heat waves on mortality, within the EuroHEAT project. Daily mortality, meteorologic, and air pollution data from nine European cities for the years 1990-2004 were assembled. We defined heat waves by taking both intensity and duration into account. The city-specific effects of heat wave episodes were estimated using generalized estimating equation models, adjusting for potential confounders with and without inclusion of air pollutants (particles, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide). To investigate effect modification, we introduced an interaction term between heat waves and each single pollutant in the models. Random effects meta-analysis was used to summarize the city-specific results. Results: The increase in the number of daily deaths during heat wave episodes was 54% higher on high ozone days compared with low, among people age 75-84 years. The heat wave effect on high PM10 days was increased by 36% and 106% in the 75-84 year and 85+ year age groups, respectively. A similar pattern was observed for effects on cardiovascular mortality. Effect modification was less evident for respiratory mortality, although the heat wave effect itself was greater for this cause of death. The heat wave effect was smaller (15-30%) after adjustment for ozone or PM10. Conclusions: The heat wave effect on mortality was larger during high ozone or high PM10 days. When assessing the effect of heat waves on mortality, lack of adjustment for ozone and especially PM10 overestimates effect parameters. This bias has implications for public health policy.

Study Selection: Published observational studies reporting genotype or allele frequencies of this genetic factor in PTSD cases and in non-PTSD controls were all considered eligible for inclusion in this systematic review. Data Extraction: Two reviewers selected studies for possible inclusion and extracted data independently following a standardized protocol. Statistical analysis: A biallelic and a triallelic meta-analysis, including the total S and S' frequencies, the dominant (S+/LL and S'+/L'L') and the recessive model (SS/L+ and S'S'/L'+), was performed with a random-effect model to calculate the pooled OR and its corresponding 95% CI. Forest plots and Cochran's Q-Statistic and I-2 index were calculated to check for heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were carried out to analyze potential moderators. Publication bias and quality of reporting were also analyzed. Results: 13 studies met our inclusion criteria, providing a total sample of 1874 patients with PTSD and 7785 controls in the biallelic meta-analyses and 627 and 3524, respectively, in the triallelic. None of the meta-analyses showed evidence of an association between 5-HTTLPR and PTSD but several characteristics (exposure to the same principal stressor for PTSD cases and controls, adjustment for potential confounding variables, blind assessment, study design, type of PTSD, ethnic distribution and Total Quality Score) influenced the results in subgroup analyses and meta-regression. There was no evidence of potential publication bias. Conclusions: Current evidence does not support a direct effect of 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms on PTSD. Further analyses of gene-environment interactions, epigenetic modulation and new studies with large samples and/or meta-analyses are required.

The risk of bias is especially high in more complex time-to-event data settings. Methods We explain how the PAF can be defined, identified and estimated in time-to-event settings with competing risks and time-dependent exposures. By using multi-state methodology and inverse probability weighting, we demonstrate how to reduce or completely avoid severe types of biases including competing risks bias, immortal time bias and confounding due to both baseline and time-varying patient characteristics. Results The method is exemplarily applied to a real data set. Moreover, we estimate the number of deaths that were attributable to ventilator-associated pneumonia in France in the year 2016. The example demonstrates how, under certain simplifying assumptions, PAF estimates can be extrapolated to a target population of interest. Conclusions Defining and estimating the PAF in advanced time-to-event settings within a framework that unifies causal and multi-state modelling enables to tackle common sources of bias and allows straightforward implementation with standard software packages.

Universities need to restructure their management methods to succeed in dealing with issues and to be consistent with the higher education system in other successful countries. Objectives: The present study aimed at designing a quantum management model for organizational learning through a systematic grounded theory approach in the Zahedan University of Medical Sciences in 2019. Methods: In this qualitative study, the methods and techniques of interpretation were used to understand the phenomena from the participants' point of view and in their particular institutional and social context. The interview was conducted with 19 people from the statistical population, including faculty members and managers of the Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, who actively participated in research and management. The data collection occurred through snowball sampling until data saturation. The information analysis process was based on three stages: open coding (creating concepts and categories), axial coding (identifying axial category, causal conditions, confounding conditions, contexts, strategies, and outcomes conditions), and selective coding (creating theory), which eventually led to the presentation of the final research model in the form of a central coding paradigm. Results: In this study, data are not expressed as numbers, but are presented as words and sentences to identify and understand people's experiences of events in a particular context. Finally, the final model of research was presented as an axial coding paradigm resulting in six themes, of which causal conditions with six categories. Conclusions: Quantum management can be used in organizational learning at the Zahedan University of Medical Sciences and to achieve the desired goals by implementing the designed and presented model in this study.

A database constructed using data obtained from 12 nursing homes in Japan was used in this study. The study period ranged from January 2014 to December 2015, and elderly individuals with dental and other medical records were included in the analysis. Linear regression models were used to analyze univariate and multivariate correlation between dental conditions, comorbidities, and other sociodemographic/clinical backgrounds. After excluding individuals with missing data, 289 elderly individuals (107 men and 182 women; mean age, 85 years) were included in the analysis. These individuals had an average of 11.6 teeth, and the number decreased with older age (P<. 001). The average number of decayed teeth was 1.4. A total of 116 subjects (40.1%) had dementia. In terms of comorbidities, dementia was not significantly associated with the number of present teeth (P=. 56), but it was associated with the number of decayed teeth (P=. 018). This association was also observed after adjusting for confounding variables in the multivariate regression analysis (P=. 030). The number of decayed teeth was associated with dementia. While causality cannot be inferred from these observational results, the findings indicate that dental health could represent a marker of impending dementia, and probably represent a marker of general health status in the elderly population. Additional longitudinal studies are highly desirable to understand the causal relationships between dental conditions and comorbidities.

Study Design and Setting: We evaluated a random sample of SRs assembled previously, which were indexed in MEDLINE during February 2014, focused on a treatment or prevention question, and reported at least one meta-analysis. The reported statistical methods used in each SR were extracted from articles and online appendices by one author, with a 20% random sample extracted in duplicate. Results: We evaluated 110 SRs; 78/110 (71%) were non-Cochrane SRs and 55/110 (50%) investigated a pharmacological intervention. The SRs presented a median of 13 (interquartile range: 5-27) meta-analytic effects. When considering the index (primary or first reported) meta-analysis of each SR, just over half (62/110 [56%]) used the random-effects model, but few (5/62 [8%]) interpreted the meta-analytic effect correctly (as the average of the intervention effects across all studies). A statistical test for funnel plot asymmetry was reported in 17/110 (15%) SRs; however, in only 4/17 (24%) did the test include the recommended number of at least 10 studies of varying size. Subgroup analyses accompanied 42/110 (38%) index meta-analyses, but findings were not interpreted with respect to a test for interaction in 29/42 (69%) cases, and the issue of potential confounding in the subgroup analyses was not raised in any SR. Conclusions: There is scope for improvement in the application and interpretation of statistical analyses in SRs of therapeutic interventions. The involvement of statisticians on the SR team and establishment of partnerships between researchers with specialist expertise in SR methods and journal editors may help overcome these shortcomings.

The instrumental variable (IV) design plays the role of a quasi-experimental handle because the IV is associated with the treatment and only affects the outcome through the treatment. In this paper, we present a novel framework for identification and inferences, using an IV for the marginal average treatment effect amongst the treated (ETT) in the presence of unmeasured confounding. For inferences, we propose three semiparametric approaches: (i) an inverse probability weighting (IPW); (ii) an outcome regression (OR); and (iii) a doubly robust (DR) estimation, which is consistent if either (i) or (ii) is consistent, but not necessarily both. A closed-form locally semiparametric efficient estimator is obtained in the simple case of a binary IV, and outcome, and the efficiency bound is derived for the more general case.

Adjustment for Disease Severity in the Test-Negative Study Design	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						bias; collapsibility; test-negative design; vaccine effectiveness	ORAL CHOLERA VACCINE; BIAS	The test-negative study design is often used to estimate vaccine effectiveness in influenza studies, but it has also been proposed in the context of other infectious diseases, such as cholera, dengue, or Ebola. It was introduced as a variation of the case-control design, in an attempt to reduce confounding bias due to health-care-seeking behavior, and has quickly gained popularity because of its logistic advantages. However, examination of the directed acyclic graphs that describe the test-negative design reveals that without strong assumptions, the estimated odds ratio derived under this sampling mechanism is not collapsible over the selection variable, such that the results obtained for the sampled individuals cannot be generalized to the whole population. In this paper, we show that adjustment for severity of disease can reduce this bias and, under certain assumptions, makes it possible to unbiasedly estimate a causal odds ratio. We support our findings with extensive simulations and discuss them in the context of recently published cholera test-negative studies of the effectiveness of cholera vaccines.

Generally, the probabilities are estimated using logistic regression models that assume linearity between the logistic link and the predictors, but the linearity might be inaccurate In this article, we proposed MSMs to assess the blood pressure-lowering effects of combination therapy with olmesartan medoxomil (OLM) plus calcium channel blockers (CCB) (OLM+CCB) in in observational study of OLM, and extended estimation methods of the probabilities for the MSMs using generalized additive models (GAMs). The estimation using GAMs was suggested to improve the balance of the distributions of confounder values between the therapy groups in the pseudo-population We obtained estimated changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) for OLM+CCB combination therapy after 12wk compared with OLM monotherapy of -4 3 mmHg (95% confidence interval (CI) -7 7 and -0 9 mmHg) and -2 9 mmHg (95% CI -5 1 and -0 7 mmHg), respectively The estimated target BP (SBP < 140 mmHg and DBP < 90 mmHg) achievement rates for OLM+CCB combination therapy and OLM monotherapy were 62 0 and 46.7%, respectively. The results of the MSMs were closer to those in the randomized controlled trial, such as the combination of OLM and amlodipine besylate in controlling high blood pressure study, (hall those of conventional methods.

To gain further insight into the underlying mechanisms of this effect, researchers may be interested in exploring whether or not it runs through a specific intermediate variable: the mediator. Mediation analysis in crossover designs has received scant attention so far and is mostly confined to the traditional Baron and Kenny approach. We aim to tackle mediation analysis within the counterfactual framework and elucidate the assumptions under which the direct and indirect effects can be identified in AB/BA crossover studies. Notably, we show that both effects are identifiable in certain statistical models, even in the presence of unmeasured time-independent (or upper-level) confounding of the mediator-outcome relation. Employing the mediation formula, we derive expressions for the direct and indirect effects in within-subject designs for continuous outcomes that lend themselves to linear modelling, under a large variety of settings. We discuss an estimation approach based on regressing differences in outcomes on differences in mediators and show how to allow for period effects as well as different types of moderation. The performance of this approach is compared to other existing methods through simulations and is illustrated with data from a neurobehavioural study. Lastly, we demonstrate how a sensitivity analysis can be performed that is able to assess the robustness of both the direct and indirect effect against violation of the "no unmeasured lower-level mediator-outcome confounding" assumption.

Effects of intergenerational exposure interventions on adolescent outcomes: An application of inverse probability weighting to longitudinal pre-birth cohort data	PAEDIATRIC AND PERINATAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						childhood obesity; Inverse probability weighting; marginal structural models; representative interventions; sensitive window; sugar-sweetened beverages	SUGAR-SWEETENED BEVERAGES; MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; CHILDREN; DISEASE; TRIAL; RISK	Background There is great interest in understanding whether interventions on sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption through pregnancy and early childhood affect adolescent body mass index (BMI). Without data from randomised trials, unbiased estimation of such effects might be achieved with observational data given sufficient and appropriate adjustment for both baseline and time-varying confounders. Objectives To illustrate the use of inverse probability (IP) weighting of marginal structural models (MSM) for estimating the effects of SSB consumption through pregnancy and early childhood on the mean early adolescent BMI z-score. Methods Our baseline sample consisted of 1584 pregnant women from a pre-birth cohort. We defined 6 intervention intervals: early pregnancy, late pregnancy, 3, 4, 5, and 6 years. We fitted a MSM via a weighted linear regression with IP exposure and censoring weights to estimate the mean difference in BMI z-score under interventions: "maintain SSB consumption below (vs above) 0.5 servings/day in all intervals." Results The estimated difference in mean BMI z-score under interventions maintaining SSB consumption at or below (vs above) 0.5 servings/day from pregnancy to 6 years was -0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI] -1.52, -0.08). The effect estimate in pregnancy, while fixing the exposure range in childhood, was -0.05 (95% CI -0.34, 0.23), and in early childhood, while fixing the range in pregnancy was -0.89 (95% CI -1.46, -0.11). The effect estimates were largely unchanged under sensitivity analyses to different implementation choices except for the choice of time interval length. Conclusions Under assumptions that include no unmeasured confounding and selection bias, and no model misspecification, results of this IP weighting application are in line with a lower mean BMI z-score in early adolescence under interventions ensuring lower, vs greater, SSB consumption in early life. This application provides a resource for researchers working with longitudinal birth cohort studies and interested in similar causal questions.

Two confounding factors-elevation of inhabited dwellings, and UVB (ultra-violet B) radiation exposure-were considered to be most correlated with the frequency of lung cancer occurrence. MEM was found to be particularly useful in extracting meaningful results from epidemiology data containing such confounding factors. In model testing, MEM proved to be more effective than the least-squares method (even via Bayesian analysis) or multi-parameter analysis, routinely applied in epidemiology. Our analysis of the available residential radon epidemiology data consistently demonstrates that the relative number of lung cancers decreases with increasing radon concentrations up to about 200 Bq/m(3), also decreasing with increasing altitude at which inhabitants live. Correlation between UVB intensity and lung cancer has also been demonstrated.

Activity-friendly communities (AFCs) have been known to provide opportunities for engaging in physical activity (PA) across the life course, which is a key to healthy living and healthy aging. Purpose: Our purpose is to describe the study protocol developed for a research project that examines: (a) the short- and long-term changes in total levels and spatial and temporal patterns of PA after individuals move from non-AFCs to an AFC; and (b) what built and natural environmental factors lead to changes in PA resulting from such a move, either directly or indirectly (e.g., by affecting psychosocial factors related to PA). Methods: This protocol is for a longitudinal, case-comparison study utilizing a unique natural experiment opportunity in Austin, Texas, USA. Case participants were those adults who moved from non-AFCs to an AFC. Matching comparison participants were residents from similar non-AFCs who did not move during the study period. Recruitment venues included local businesses, social and print media, community events, and individual referrals. Objectively measured moderate-to-vigorous PA and associated spatial and temporal patterns served as the key outcomes of interest. Independent (e.g., physical environments), confounding (e.g., demographic factors), and mediating variables (e.g., psychosocial factors) were captured using a combination of objective (e.g., GIS, GPS, Tanita scale) and subjective measures (e.g., survey, travel diary). Statistical analyses will be conducted using multiple methods, including difference-in-differences models, repeated-measures linear mixed models, hierarchical marked space-time Poisson point pattern analysis, and hierarchical linear mixed models. Conclusion: Natural experiment studies help investigate causal relationships between health and place. However, multiple challenges associated with participant recruitment, extensive and extended data collection activities, and unpredictable intervention schedules have discouraged many researchers from implementing such studies in community-based populations. This detailed study protocol will inform the execution of future studies to explore how AFCs impact population health across the life course.

Using longitudinal register data on 2,720,431 residents aged 30-60 years, we assessed how current unemployment and unemployment history predict visits to specialized care due to psychiatric conditions and self-harm in Finland in 2008-2018. We used linear ordinary-least-squares and fixed-effects models. Prior to adjusting for time-invariant characteristics, current unemployment was associated with poor mental health, and the risk increased with longer unemployment histories. Accounting for all time-invariant characteristics with the fixed-effects models, these associations attenuated by approximately 70%, yet current unemployment was still associated with a 0.51 (95% confidence interval: 0.48, 0.53) percentage-point increase in the probability of poor mental health among men and women. Longer unemployment histories increased the probability among men in their 30s but not among older men or among women. The results indicate that selection by stable characteristics may explain a major part of the worse mental health among the unemployed and especially the long-term unemployed. However, even when controlling for this selection, current unemployment remains associated with mental health.

The method is based on regression calibration. In cases in which the diet-disease association is mediated by the biomarker, the association needs to be estimated as the total dietary effect in a mediation model. However, the hypothesis of no association is best tested through a marginal model that includes as the exposure the regression calibration-estimated intake but not the biomarker. The authors illustrate the method with data from the Carotenoids and Age-Related Eye Disease Study (2001-2004) and show that inclusion of the biomarker in the regression calibration-estimated intake increases the statistical power. This development sheds light on previous analyses of diet-disease associations reported in the literature.

J	Greenland, S				Greenland, Sander			Invited Commentary: The Need for Cognitive Science in Methodology	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Editorial Material						behavioral economics; bias analysis; cognitive bias; motivated reasoning; nullism; overconfidence; sensitivity analysis; significance testing	P-VALUES; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; MISINTERPRETATION; INFERENCE; CAUSAL	There is no complete solution for the problem of abuse of statistics, but methodological training needs to cover cognitive biases and other psychosocial factors affecting inferences. The present paper discusses 3 common cognitive distortions: 1) dichotomania, the compulsion to perceive quantities as dichotomous even when dichotomization is unnecessary and misleading, as in inferences based on whether a P value is "statistically significant"; 2) nullism, the tendency to privilege the hypothesis of no difference or no effect when there is no scientific basis for doing so, as when testing only the null hypothesis; and 3) statistical reification, treating hypothetical data distributions and statistical models as if they reflect known physical laws rather than speculative assumptions for thought experiments. As commonly misused, null-hypothesis significance testing combines these cognitive problems to produce highly distorted interpretation and reporting of study results. Interval estimation has so far proven to be an inadequate solution because it involves dichotomization, an avenue for nullism. Sensitivity and bias analyses have been proposed to address reproducibility problems (Am J Epidemiol. 2017;186(6):646-647); these methods can indeed address reification, but they can also introduce new distortions via misleading specifications for bias parameters. P values can be reframed to lessen distortions by presenting them without reference to a cutoff, providing them for relevant alternatives to the null, and recognizing their dependence on all assumptions used in their computation; they nonetheless require rescaling for measuring evidence. I conclude that methodological development and training should go beyond coverage of mechanistic biases (e.g., confounding, selection bias, measurement error) to cover distortions of conclusions produced by statistical methods and psychosocial forces.

International cohort study indicates no association between alpha-1 blockers and susceptibility to COVID-19 in benign prostatic hyperplasia patients	FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY			English	Article						treatment for SARS CoV-2; observational study; electronic health records; federated data model; causal inference; open science	ELECTRONIC MEDICAL-RECORDS; DATABASE; BIAS	Purpose: Alpha-1 blockers, often used to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), have been hypothesized to prevent COVID-19 complications by minimising cytokine storm release. The proposed treatment based on this hypothesis currently lacks support from reliable real-world evidence, however. We leverage an international network of large-scale healthcare databases to generate comprehensive evidence in a transparent and reproducible manner. Methods: In this international cohort study, we deployed electronic health records from Spain (SIDIAP) and the United States (Department of Veterans Affairs, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, IQVIA OpenClaims, Optum DOD, Optum EHR). We assessed association between alpha-1 blocker use and risks of three COVID-19 outcomes-diagnosis, hospitalization, and hospitalization requiring intensive services-using a prevalent-user active-comparator design. We estimated hazard ratios using state-of-the-art techniques to minimize potential confounding, including large-scale propensity score matching/stratification and negative control calibration. We pooled database-specific estimates through random effects meta-analysis. Results: Our study overall included 2.6 and 0.46 million users of alpha-1 blockers and of alternative BPH medications. We observed no significant difference in their risks for any of the COVID-19 outcomes, with our meta-analytic HR estimates being 1.02 (95% CI: 0.92-1.13) for diagnosis, 1.00 (95% CI: 0.89-1.13) for hospitalization, and 1.15 (95% CI: 0.71-1.88) for hospitalization requiring intensive services. Conclusion: We found no evidence of the hypothesized reduction in risks of the COVID-19 outcomes from the prevalent-use of alpha-1 blockers-further research is needed to identify effective therapies for this novel disease.

J	Siadaty, MS; Philbrick, JT; Heim, SW; Schectman, JM				Siadaty, MS; Philbrick, JT; Heim, SW; Schectman, JM			Repeated-measures modeling improved comparison of diagnostic tests in meta-analysis of dependent studies	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						meta-analysis; diagnostic test; repeated measurement; marginal model; DOR	CURVE	Objective: Current methods for meta-analysis of diagnostic tests do not allow utilizing all the information from papers in which several tests have been studied on the same patient sample. We demonstrate how to combine several studies of diagnostic tests, where each study reports on more than one test and some tests (but not necessarily all of them) are shared with other papers selected for the meta-analysis. We adopt statistical methodology for repeated measurements for the purpose of meta-analysis of diagnostic tests. Study Design and Setting: The method allows for missing values of some tests for some papers, takes into account different sample sizes of papers, adjusts for background and confounding factors including test-specific covariates and paper-specific covariates, and accounts for correlations of the repeated measurements within each paper. It does not need individual-level data, although it can be modified to use them, and uses the two-by-two table of test results vs. gold standard. Results: The results are translated from diagnostic odds ratios (DOR) to more clinically useful measures such as predictive values, post-test probabilities, and likelihood ratios. Models to capture between-study variation are introduced. The fit and influence of specific studies on the regression can be evaluated. Furthermore, model-based tests for homogeneity of DORs across papers are presented. Conclusion: The use of this new method is illustrated using a recent meta-analysis of the D-dimer test for the diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Some of the problems, such as the random, skewed, or no X-inactivation model uncertainty, have been investigated. Other considerations have received little to no attention, such as the value in considering nonadditive and gene-sex interaction effects, and the inferential consequence of choosing different baseline alleles (i.e., the reference vs. the alternative allele). Here we propose a unified and flexible regression-based association test for X-chromosomal variants. We provide theoretical justifications for its robustness in the presence of various model uncertainties, as well as for its improved power when compared with the existing approaches under certain scenarios. For completeness, we also revisit the autosomes and show that the proposed framework leads to a more robust approach than the standard method. Finally, we provide supporting evidence by revisiting several published association studies. Supporting Information for this article are available online.

A comprehensive assessment of potential confounding influences is important in these studies because inadequate assessment of confounders can threaten the validity of causal inferences drawn from the data. Potential confounders typically include demographic background variables, alcohol and smoking during pregnancy, the quality of parental stimulation, the child's age at test, and the examiner. Exposure to other substances is assessed where significant exposure is expected in the target population. in most studies, control variables even weakly related to outcome are included in all multivariate statistical analyses, and a toxic effect is inferred only if the effect of exposure is significant after controlling for the potential confounders. Once a neurotoxic effect has been identified, suspected mediating variables may be added to the analysis to examine underlying processes or mechanisms through which the exposure may impact on developmental outcome. Individual differences in vulnerability may be examined in terms of either an additive compensatory model or a synergistic ''risk and resilience'' approach. Failure to detect real effects (Type II error) is of particular concern in these studies because public policy considerations make it likely that negative findings will be interpreted to mean that the exposure is safe. Important sources of Type II error include inadequate representation of highly exposed individuals, overcontrol for confounders, and inappropriate correction for multiple comparisons. Given the high cost and complexity of prospective, longitudinal investigations, cross-sectional pilot studies focusing on highly exposed individuals can be valuable for the initial identification of salient domains of impairment.

Herein, a predictive model was developed to test the hypothesis that only certain metastatic patients would gain a survival benefit from primary tumor surgery. Methods: Clinical data for patients with mEC were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database [2004-2016] and then divided into surgery and no-surgery groups according to whether surgery was performed on the primary tumor. Propensity-score-matching (PSM) was performed to balance the confounding factors. We hypothesized that the patients who had undergone surgery and lived longer than the median cancer-specific-survival (CSS) of the no-surgery group could benefit from surgery. We constructed a nomogram to predict surgery benefit potential based on multivariable logistic-regression analysis using preoperative factors. The predictive performance of the nomogram was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) and calibration curves. The clinical application value of the nomogram was estimated with decision curve analysis (DCA). Results: A total of 5,250 eligible patients with mEC were identified, and 9.4% [492] received primary tumor surgery. After PSM, CSS for the surgery group was significantly longer [median: 19 vs. 9 months; hazard ratio (HR) 0.52, P 0.001] compared with the no-surgery group. Among the surgery group, 69.3% [327] survived 9 months (surgery-beneficial group). The prediction nomogram showed good discrimination both in training and validation sets (AUC: 0.72 and 0.70, respectively), and the calibration curves indicated a good consistency. DCA demonstrated that the nomogram was clinically useful. According to this nomogram, surgery patients were classified into two groups: no-benefit-candidate and benefit-candidate. The benefit candidate group was associated with longer survival than the no-benefit-candidate group (median CSS: 19 vs. 6.5 months, P<0.001). Additionally, there was no difference in survival between the no-benefit-candidate and no-surgery groups (median CSS: 6.5 vs. 9 months, P=0.070). Conclusions: A predictive model was created for the selection of candidates for surgical treatment among mEC patients. This predictive model might be used to select patients who may benefit from primary tumor surgery.

J	Clarke, PS				Clarke, PS			Analysing change based on two measures taken under different conditions	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						bootstrap; change; growth curve models; simultaneous equation models; value-added model	CAUSAL-ANALYSIS; WHITEHALL-II; HEALTH; GROWTH; MODELS	Consider an analysis of change using two measurements on each individual taken from two periods of a longitudinal study, where the measurement conditions were different at each study period. In such Situations, 'conditions effects' will necessarily be confounded with change between periods. An example of a conditions effect is a practice or learning effect, where a participant is tested at each period but learns to complete the test more effectively on the second occasion. If the conditions effect mechanism is associated with change and other factors in the analysis then biased model estimates will result. Unfortunately, as with classical age-period-cohort problems, estimating the conditions effect is impossible without modelling assumptions. In this paper, we show that the conditions effect is identifiable given empirically unverifiable assumptions about: (1) the sources of confounding bias in the study; (2) the functional form of age-related change; and (3) factors related to the conditions-effect. We develop the conditions-effect adjustment model (CEAM) for estimating change effects under different sets of assumptions. While none of these assumptions can be verified using the data alone, it is argued that assumptions I and 2 are always required when analysing change-even in the absence of conditions effects-and that robustness to all these assumptions can be assessed via sensitivity analysis. The CEAM is illustrated in an application to cognitive test data from the Whitehall II study of British civil servants. Copyright (C) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

History-adjusted marginal structural analysis of the association between hemoglobin variability and mortality among chronic hemodialysis patients	CLINICAL JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEPHROLOGY			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	39th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-of-Nephrology/Annual Renal Week	NOV 14-19, 2006	San Diego, CA	Amer Soc Nephrol			CAUSAL INFERENCE; SURVIVAL; HOSPITALIZATION; MODELS; IRON	Background and objectives: Hemoglobin variability is common among dialysis patients, and has been associated with increased mortality. The causal nature of this association has been difficult to ascertain because of potential time-dependent confounding, for which traditional statistical methods do not control. Design, settings, participants, & measurements: A retrospective cohort of 34,963 Fresenius Medical care dialysis patients from 1996 was assembled. Hemoglobin variability, absolute hemoglobin level, and temporal hemoglobin trend were measured over rolling 6-mo exposure windows. Their association with mortality was estimated using history-adjusted marginal structural analysis that adjusts for time-dependent confounding by applying weights to observations inversely related to the predictability of observed levels of hemoglobin. Results: In the primary analysis, each g/dl increase in hemoglobin variability was associated with an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] for all-cause mortality of 1.93 (1.20 to 3.10). Neither higher absolute hemoglobin level nor increasing hemoglobin trend were significantly associated with mortality; adjusted HR (95% CI) 0.85 (0.64 to 1.11) and 0.60 (0.25 to 1.45), respectively. Conclusions: Marginal structural analysis demonstrates that hemoglobin variability is associated with increased mortality among chronic hemodialysis patients, and that this effect is more pronounced than appreciated using standard statistical techniques that do not take time-dependent confounding into account.

J	Suarez, D; Borràs, R; Basagaña, X				Suarez, David; Borras, Roger; Basagana, Xavier			Differences Between Marginal Structural Models and Conventional Models in Their Exposure Effect Estimates <i>A Systematic Review</i>	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Review							PROPENSITY SCORE METHODS; REGRESSION	Background: Marginal structural models were developed to address time-varying confounding in nonrandomized exposure effect studies. It is unclear how estimates from marginal structural models and conventional models might differ in real settings. Methods: We systematically reviewed the literature on marginal structural models since 2000. Results: Data to compare marginal structural models and conventional models were obtained from 65 papers reporting 164 exposure-outcome associations. In 58 (40%), estimates differed by at least 20%, and in 18 (11%), the 2 techniques resulted in estimates with opposite interpretations. In 88 papers, marginal structural models were used to analyze real data; only 53 (60%) papers reported the use of stabilized inverse-probability weights and only 28 (32%) reported that they verified that the mean of the stabilized inverse-probability weights was close to 1.0. Conclusions: We found important differences in results from marginal structural models and from conventional models in real studies. Furthermore, reporting of marginal structural models can be improved.

Despite the comprehensive literature on TND, the use of TND in COVID-19 studies is relatively new and calls for robust design and analysis to adapt to a rapidly changing and dynamically evolving pandemic and to account for changes in testing and reporting practices. In this commentary, we aim to draw the attention of researchers to COVID-specific challenges in using TND as we are analyzing data amassed over more than two years of the pandemic. We first review when and why TND works and general challenges in TND studies presented in the literature. We then discuss COVID-specific challenges which have not received adequate acknowledgment but may add to the risk of invalid conclusions in TND studies of COVID-19.

J	Mittinty, MN; Vansteelandt, S				Mittinty, Murthy N.; Vansteelandt, Stijn			Longitudinal Mediation Analysis Using Natural Effect Models	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						counterfactual; decomposition; longitudinal mediation; mediation	TIME-VARYING EXPOSURES	Mediation analysis is concerned with the decomposition of the total effect of an exposure on an outcome into the indirect effect, through a given mediator, and the remaining direct effect. This is ideally done using longitudinal measurements of the mediator, which capture the mediator process more finely. However, longitudinal measurements pose challenges for mediation analysis, because the mediators and outcomes measured at a given time point can act as confounders for the association between mediators and outcomes at a later time point; these confounders are themselves affected by the prior exposure and outcome. Such posttreatment confounding cannot be dealt with using standard methods (e.g., generalized estimating equations). Analysis is further complicated by the need for so-called cross-world counterfactuals to decompose the total effect. This work addresses these challenges. In particular, we introduce so-called natural effect models, which parameterize the direct and indirect effect of a baseline exposure with respect to a longitudinal mediator and outcome. These can be viewed as a generalization of marginal structural mean models to enable effect decomposition. We introduce inverse probability weighting techniques for fitting these models, adjusting for (measured) time-varying confounding of the mediator-outcome association. Application of this methodology uses data from the Millennium Cohort Study, a longitudinal study of children born in the United Kingdom between September 2000 and January 2002.

Variations in prostate biopsy recommendation and acceptance confound evaluation of risk factors for prostate cancer: Examining race and BMI	CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Risk factor; Prevention; Prostate cancer; Differential misclassification	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; VITAMIN-E; TRIAL; SELENIUM; MEN; FINASTERIDE	Background: Prostate cancer is ubiquitous in older men; differential screening patterns and variations in biopsy recommendations and acceptance will affect which man is diagnosed and, therefore, evaluation of cancer risk factors. We describe a statistical method to reduce prostate cancer detection bias among African American (n = 3398) and Non-Hispanic White men (n = 22,673) who participated in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention trial (SELECT) and revisit a previously reported association between race, obesity and prostate cancer risk. Methods: For men with screening values suggesting prostate cancer but in whom biopsy was not performed, the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator was used to estimate probability of prostate cancer. Associations of body mass index (BMI) and race with incident prostate cancer were compared for observed versus imputation-enhanced outcomes using incident density ratios. Results: Accounting for differential biopsy assessment, the previously reported positive linear trend between BMI and prostate cancer in African American men was not observed; no BMI association was found among Non-Hispanic White men. Conclusions: Differential disease classification among men who may be recommended to undergo and then consider whether to accept a prostate biopsy leads to inaccurate identification of prostate cancer risk factors. Imputing a man's prostate cancer status reduces detection bias. Covariate adjustment does not address the problem of outcome misclassification. Cohorts evaluating incident prostate cancer should collect longitudinal screening and biopsy data to adjust for this potential bias.

Design: A prospective cohort study with multistage random sampling. Logistic regression analysis evaluated the significance of the longitudinal associations of intake frequencies of the major food categories with future (4 years later) risk of new depression, controlled for possible confounding factors with or without adjustment for cognitive status. Setting: Population-based free-living elderly. Subjects: Men and women (n 1609) >= 65 years of age. Results: In a regression model that controlled for demographic, socio-economic, lifestyle and disease/health-related variables but not cognitive status, both fruits (OR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.45, 0.98, P = 0.038) and vegetables (OR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.17, 0.86, P = 0.021) were protective against depressive symptoms 4 years later. However, when the same regression model was also adjusted for cognitive status, only vegetables (OR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.17, 0.95, P = 0.039) were protective against depressive symptoms. Higher consumption of eggs was close to being significant in both regression models (P = 0.087 and 0.069, respectively). Other food categories including meat/poultry, fish, seafood, dairy, legumes, grains and tea showed no significant associations. Conclusions: Results suggest that although confounding factors cannot be totally ruled out, more frequent consumption of vegetables seems to be protective against depressive symptoms in the elderly. Further studies are needed to elucidate the causal role and the mechanism of the association.

The aim of this study was to investigate child and caregiver characteristics which may predict childhood burn injuries among Iranian children and to examine whether confounding exists among these predictors. Methods A hospital based case-control study was conducted using 281 burn victims and 273 hospital-based controls, which were matched by age, gender and place of residence (rural/urban). The characteristics of the children and their caregivers were analyzed using crude and adjusted models to test whether these were predictors of childhood burn injuries. Results The age of the caregiver was significantly lower for burn victims than for the controls (P<0.05). Further, the amount of time the caregiver spent outdoors with the child and their economic status had a significant positive association with the odds of a burn injury (P<0.05). A multivariate logistic regression found that Type A behaviour among caregivers was independently associated with the child's odds of suffering a burn injury (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.04-1.21). The research also found that children with ADHD (Inattentive subscale: Crude OR = 2.14, 95% CI: 1.16-3.95, Adjusted OR = 5.65, 95% CI: 2.53-12.61; Hyperactive subscale: Crude OR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.23-2.41, Adjusted OR = 2.53, 95% CI: 1.65-3.87) also had increased odds of suffering a burn injury. However, several variables were identified as possible negative confounder variables, as the associations were stronger in the multivariate model than in the crude models. Conclusion The caregiver's characteristics which were predictors of burn injuries among Iranian children were: being younger, high socio-economic status, Type A behavioural pattern and spending more time outdoors. In addition, the relationship between a child's ADHD scores and the odds of a burn injury may be negatively confounded by the caregivers predictor variables.

Accommodating Measurements Below a Limit of Detection: A Novel Application of Cox Regression	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						2; 3; 7; 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; 2; 4; 4-trichlorobiphenyl; hazard identification; limit of detection; National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; nondetects; proportional hazards	POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS; SUBJECT; MODELS; SERUM	In environmental epidemiology, measurements of exposure biomarkers often fall below the assays limit of detection. Existing methods for handling this problem, including deletion, substitution, parametric regression, and multiple imputation, can perform poorly if the proportion of nondetects is high or parametric models are misspecified. We propose an approach that treats the measured analyte as the modeled outcome, implying a role reversal when the analyte is a putative cause of a health outcome. Following a scale reversal as well, our approach uses Cox regression to model the analyte, with confounder adjustment. The method makes full use of quantifiable analyte measures, while appropriately treating nondetects as censored. Under the proportional hazards assumption, the hazard ratio for a binary health outcome is interpretable as an adjusted odds ratio: the odds for the outcome at any particular analyte concentration divided by the odds given a lower concentration. Our approach is broadly applicable to cohort studies, case-control studies (frequency matched or not), and cross-sectional studies conducted to identify determinants of exposure. We illustrate the method with cross-sectional survey data to assess sex as a determinant of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin concentration and with prospective cohort data to assess the association between 2,4,4-trichlorobiphenyl exposure and psychomotor development.

Comparative Effectiveness of Initial Surgery vs Initial Systemic Therapy for Metastatic Kidney Cancer in the Targeted Therapy Era: Analysis of a Population-based Cohort	UROLOGY			English	Article							RENAL-CELL CARCINOMA; CYTOREDUCTIVE NEPHRECTOMY; PROPENSITY SCORE; INTERFERON-ALPHA; SURVIVAL; MODELS	OBJECTIVE To use econometric methods to assess comparative overall survival of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) managed with initial cytoreductive nephrectomy (CN) vs initial systemic therapy. Randomized data demonstrate improved survival for CN preceding cytokinebased therapy in mRCC. This benefit may be attenuated in the contemporary mRCC era given more effective systemic therapies. METHODS Patients over age 65 with mRCC from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries linked with Medicare claims from 2006 to 2011 were categorized by initial treatment. We applied sequential survival analysis methods to assess the association between initial CN and overall survival (OS) including Cox proportional hazards models, propensity scoring, and instrumental variable analysis to account for measured and unmeasured selection bias. RESULTS Of 537 patients analyzed, 190 had initial CN followed by targeted therapy and 347 had initial targeted therapy. Median OS in the initial CN group was 17.4 months (interquartile range 9.832.0), compared with 9.2 months (interquartile range 4.3-18.0) for initial targeted therapy. Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed initial CN was associated with improved OS (hazard ratio 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38-0.65). Propensity matching demonstrated a survival advantage for initial CN of 5.8 months (95% CI 1.9-9.7). Accounting for unmeasured confounding with instrumental variable analysis demonstrated a trend toward improved survival with initial CN (hazard ratio 0.29 [95% CI 0.08-1.00]). CONCLUSION Initial CN is associated with improved survival compared with initial systemic therapy in a contemporary population-based mRCC cohort. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We propose a new statistical method to test the relationship between exposure and time to death in the presence of the: healthy worker effect. The basic idea of the proposed method reflects length bias sampling caused by job changes According to simulation studies, both the proposed test and a test based on the Cox model including job changes as a time-dependent covariate seem to be satisfactory at the upper 5% significance level. However, the Cox models involving job changes as a time-independent covariate are unsatisfactory. The proposed test is superior in power to the test based on the Cox model with time-dependent employment status. Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.

IPTW involves two main steps. First, the probability-or propensity-of being exposed to the risk factor or intervention of interest is calculated, given an individual's characteristics (i.e. propensity score). Second, weights are calculated as the inverse of the propensity score. The application of these weights to the study population creates a pseudopopulation in which confounders are equally distributed across exposed and unexposed groups. We also elaborate on how weighting can be applied in longitudinal studies to deal with informative censoring and time-dependent confounding in the setting of treatment-confounder feedback.

However, recent systematic reviews have demonstrated that propensity score methods are inconsistently used and frequently poorly applied in the medical literature. In this study, we compared the following propensity score methods for estimating the reduction in all-cause mortality due to statin therapy for patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction: propensity-score matching, stratification using the propensity score, covariate adjustment using the propensity score, and weighting using the propensity score. We used propensity score methods to estimate both adjusted treated effects and the absolute and relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality. We also examined the use of statistical hypothesis testing, standardized differences, box plots, non-parametric density estimates, and quantile-quantile plots to assess residual confounding that remained after stratification or matching on the propensity score. Estimates of the absolute reduction in 3-year mortality ranged from 2.1 to 4.5 per cent, while estimates of the relative risk reduction ranged from 13.3 to 17.0 per cent. Adjusted estimates of the reduction in the odds of 3-year death varied from 15 to 24 per cent across the different propensity score methods. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

One of the major confounding factors comes from the presence of population structure among sampled individuals, namely population stratification. When exists, it will lead to biased quantitative phenotype prediction, therefore hampering the unambiguous conclusions about prediction and limiting the downstream usage like disease evaluation or epidemiology survey. Population stratification is an implicit bias that can not be easily removed by data preprocessing. With the purpose of training a phenotype prediction model, we propose an adversarial training framework that ensures the genomics encoder is agnostic to sample populations. For better generalization, our adversarial training framework is orthogonal to the genomics encoder and phenotype prediction model. We experimentally ascertain our debiasing framework by testing on a real-world yield (phenotype) prediction dataset with soybean genomics. The developed framework is designed for general genomic data (e.g., human, livestock, and crops) while the phenotype can be either continuous or categorical variables.

They show that if misclassification is nondifferential and the predictive value matrices are independent of other predictor variables it is possible to recover the true relative risks as a function of the biased estimates and the misclassification matrices alone. If the covariable is a confounder, the true relative risks may be recovered from the apparent relative risks derived from misclassified data and the misclassification matrix for the exposure variable with respect to its surrogate. If the covariable is an effect modifier, the true relative risk matrix may be recovered from the apparent relative risk matrix and misclassification matrices for both the exposure variable with respect to its surrogate and the covariable with respect to its surrogate. By varying the misclassification matrices, the sensitivity of published relative risk estimates to different patterns of misclassification can be analyzed. If it is not possible to design a study protocol that is free of misclassification, choosing surrogate variables whose predictive value is constant with respect to other predictors appears to be a desirable design objective.

J	Blakely, TA; Woodward, AJ				Blakely, TA; Woodward, AJ			Ecological effects in multi-level studies	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article							HEALTH-RELATED BEHAVIOR; UNITED-STATES; PUBLIC-HEALTH; EPIDEMIOLOGY; CONTEXT; MORTALITY; INCOME; MISCLASSIFICATION; INEQUALITY; BIASES	Multi-level research that attempts to describe ecological effects in themselves (for example, the effect on individual health from living in deprived communities), while also including individual level effects (for example, the effect of personal socioeconomic disadvantage), is now prominent in research on the socioeconomic determinants of health and disease. Such research often involves the application of advanced statistical multi-level methods. It is hypothesised that such research is at risk of reaching beyond an epidemiological understanding of what constitutes an ecological effect, and what sources of error may be influencing any observed ecological effect. This paper aims to present such an epidemiological understanding. Three basic types of ecological effect are described: a direct cross level effect (for example, living in a deprived community directly affects individual personal health), cross level effect modification (for example, living in a deprived community modifies the effect of individual socioeconomic status on individual health), and an indirect cross level effect (for example, living in a deprived community increases the risk of smoking, which in turn affects individual health). Sources of error and weaknesses in study design that may affect estimates of ecological effects include: a lack of variation in the ecological exposure (and health outcome) in the available data; not allowing for intraclass correlation; selection bias; confounding at both the ecological and individual level; misclassification of variables; misclassification of units of analysis and assignment of individuals to those units; model mis-specification; and multicollinearity. Identification of ecological effects requires the minimisation of these sources of error, and a study design that captures sufficient variation in the ecological exposure of interest.

Studies have reported that Se could play an important role in adverse outcomes such as miscarriages, neural tube defects, diaphragmatic hernia, premature birth, low birth weight, pre-eclampsia, glucose intolerance and gestational diabetes. Also, low Se status has been associated with adverse outcomes among HIV-infected pregnant women and their offspring. Nevertheless, the function of Se in the aetiology of pregnancy complications is yet to be elucidated. Available evidence presents the following limitations: most study designs do not allow conclusions about causal relationships; study populations, selection of subjects, research setting, procedures for defining sample size and analytical methods are often poorly described; many studies fail to adjust for important confounding variables. In addition, population studies assessing the relationship between Se intake during pregnancy and health outcomes are scarce. Further research is still needed to clarify the role of Se status in adverse pregnancy outcomes, especially those related to augmented oxidative stress.

A Genetically Informed Longitudinal Study of Loneliness and Dementia Risk in Older Adults	FRONTIERS IN GENETICS			English	Article						loneliness; dementia; aging; behavior genetics; longitudinal analysis		Although several studies have shown small longitudinal associations between baseline loneliness and subsequent dementia risk, studies rarely test whether change in loneliness predicts dementia risk. Furthermore, as both increase with advancing age, genetic and environmental selection processes may confound the putative causal association between loneliness and dementia risk. We used a sample of 2,476 individual twins from three longitudinal twin studies of aging in the Swedish Twin Registry to test the hypothesis that greater positive change in loneliness predicts greater dementia risk. We then used a sample of 1,632 pairs of twins to evaluate the hypothesis that effects of change in loneliness on dementia risk would remain after adjusting for effects of genetic and environmental variance. Phenotypic model results suggest that mild levels of baseline loneliness predict greater dementia risk. Contrary to our hypothesis, change in loneliness did not correlate with dementia risk, regardless of whether genetic and environmental selection confounds were taken into account. Worsening loneliness with age may not confer greater dementia risk.	[Kim, Alice J.; Gold, Alaina I.; Fenton, Laura; Pilgrim, Matthew J.

Associations between these ambient concentrations and health outcomes such as lung function, hospital admissions, and mortality have been examined in short- and long-term cohort studies as well as in time-series and case-crossover studies. The issues related to interpreting the observed associations of ambient air pollutants with health outcomes were discussed at the US EPA sponsored workshop on December 13 and 14, 2006 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA. The second session of this workshop focused on the following topics: ( 1) statistical methodology and study designs that may improve understanding of multipollutant health effects; ( 2) ambient concentrations as surrogate measures of pollutant mixtures; and ( 3) source-focused epidemiologic research. New methodology and approaches to better distinguish the effects of individual pollutants include multicity hierarchical modeling and the use of case-crossover analysis to control for copollutants. An alternative approach is to examine the mixture as a whole using principal component analysis. Another important consideration is to what extent the observed health associations are attributable to individual pollutants, which are often from common sources and are correlated, versus the pollutant mixtures that the pollutants are representing. For example, several ambient air concentrations, such as particulate matter mass, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide, may be serving as surrogate measures of motor vehicle exhaust. Source apportionment analysis is one method that may allow further advancement in understanding the source components that contribute to multipollutant health effects.

A stratified generalized additive model and permutation test for temporal heterogeneity of smoothed bivariate spatial effects	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						GAMs; GLMs; LOESS; permutation tests; spatiotemporal data	WEIGHTED REGRESSION; PARAMETER	Generalized additive models (GAMs) with bivariate smoothers are frequently used to map geographic disease risks in epidemiology studies. A challenge in identifying health disparities has been the lack of intuitive and computationally feasible methods to assess whether the pattern of spatial effects varies over time. In this research, we accommodate time-stratified smoothers into the GAM framework to estimate time-specific spatial risk patterns while borrowing information from confounding effects across time. A backfitting algorithm for model estimation is proposed along with a permutation testing framework for assessing temporal heterogeneity of geospatial risk patterns across two or more time points. Simulation studies show that our proposed permuted mean squared difference (PMSD) test performs well with respect to type I error and power in various settings when compared with existing methods. The proposed model and PMSD test are used geospatial risk patterns of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in the state of Massachusetts over 2003-2009. We show that there is variation over time in spatial patterns of PDA risk, adjusting for other known risk factors, suggesting the presence of potential time-varying and space-related risk factors other than the adjusted ones.

Analysis of Observational Self-matched Data to Examine Acute Triggers of Outcome Events with Abrupt Onset	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Review						Patient Centered Outcomes Research; Epidemiological Methods; study design; Case-Only Designs; Self-Controlled Designs; triggers	CASE-CROSSOVER DESIGN; CASE SERIES ANALYSIS; MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; BIAS; SELECTION; RISK; SAFETY	Several self-matched approaches have been proposed, including case-crossover, case-time control, fixed-effects case-time control, and self-controlled case series. Rather than comparing treatment effects between different individuals, studies use these approaches to evaluate the acute effects of transient exposures, often called triggers, by comparing outcome risk among the same individual at different times. This eliminates confounding by between-person characteristics that remain stable over time, allowing for valid analyses even in situations where information on some health behaviors is not available, such as long-term smoking history. However, to attain valid results, differences in the probability of exposure and outcome that change over time must be addressed in the design and analysis of the study. In this article, we describe the setting, assumptions and analytic options for conducting studies using self-matched data. Approaches that involve matching or a group of noncases to address time-varying confounding may have less statistical flexibility but they are powerful tools that overcome the need to assume a particular form of any time trends in potential confounders. If data are available for all of the person-time under study, there is a gain in statistical efficiency and the ability to address time-varying confounding using flexible regression models, under the strong assumption of no mis-specification of the model.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; FUNCTION DECLINE; INACTIVITY; MODELS; RISK	Concerns exist that the positive association of physical activity with better lung function, which has been suggested in previous longitudinal studies in smokers, is due to reverse causation. To investigate this, we applied structural equation modeling (SEM), an exploratory approach, and marginal structural modeling (MSM), an approach from the causal inference framework that corrects for reverse causation and time-dependent confounding and estimates causal effects, on data from participants in the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS, a multicentre European cohort study initiated in 1991-1993 with ECRHS I, and with two follow-ups: ECRHS II in 1999-2003, and ECRHS III in 2010-2014). 753 subjects who reported current smoking at ECRHS II, with repeated data on lung function at ECRHS I, II and III, physical activity at ECRHS II and III, and potential confounders at ECRHS I and II, were included in the analyses. SEM showed positive associations between physical activity and lung function in both directions. MSM suggested a protectivecausaleffect of physical activity on lung function (overall difference in mean beta (95% CI), comparing active versus non-active individuals: 58 mL (21-95) for forced expiratory volume in one second and 83 mL (36-130) for forced vital capacity). Our results suggest bi-directional causation and support a true protective effect of physical activity on lung function in smokers, after accounting for reverse causation and time-dependent confounding.

Research appears to suggest that this improvement is temporary but the findings have been obscured by the use of inappropriate measures of distress, failure to control for Type II and tin ubiquitous use of repeated pair-wise testing) Type I statistical error, poor measures of dental functioning, inadequate descriptions of sampling, failure to include moderating variables such as the impact of dentures on daily living and failure to allow for causal effects of distress. Individual variation has been overlooked: only some patients may be significantly distressed by their dentures. It has been difficult to find control groups of patients to exclude the effect of confounding influences. The crucial assumption, that psychological distress reduces as dental functioning improves, has not been examined. Statistical modelling, using suitable measures of chronic distress, controlling for the effects of moderating variables and examining causal relationships, would help to clarify this, Psychological distress, according to statistical analysis designed to avoid Type I and Type II error, should be less, long after the fitting of implants than before.

Risk of congenital anomalies near municipal waste incinerators in England and Scotland: Retrospective population-based cohort study	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Environment; Congenital anomalies; Municipal waste incinerator; Epidemiology	ADVERSE PREGNANCY OUTCOMES; AIR-POLLUTION; EXPOSURE; EMISSIONS; HYPOSPADIAS; MULTISITE; DENSITY; BIRTH	Background: Few studies have investigated congenital anomalies in relation to municipal waste incinerators (MWIs) and results are inconclusive. Objectives: To conduct a national investigation into the risk of congenital anomalies in babies born to mothers living within 10 km of an MWI associated with: i) modelled concentrations of PM10 as a proxy for MWI emissions more generally and; ii) proximity of residential postcode to nearest MWI, in areas in England and Scotland that are covered by a congenital anomaly register. Methods: Retrospective population-based cohort study within 10 km of 10 MWIs in England and Scotland operating between 2003 and 2010. Exposure was proximity to MWI and log of daily mean modelled ground-level particulate matter <= 10 mu m diameter (PM10) concentrations. Results: Analysis included 219,486 births, stillbirths and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly of which 5154 were cases of congenital anomalies. Fully adjusted odds ratio (OR) per doubling in PM10 was: 1.00 (95% CI 0.98-1.02) for all congenital anomalies; 0.99 (0.97-1.01) for all congenital anomalies excluding chromosomal anomalies. For every 1 km closer to an MWI adjusted OR was: 1.02 (1.00-1.04) for all congenital anomalies combined; 1.02 (1.00-1.04) for all congenital anomalies excluding chromosomal anomalies; and, for specific anomaly groups, 1.04 (1.01-1.08) for congenital heart defect sand 1.07 (1.02-1.12) for genital anomalies. Discussion: We found no increased risk of congenital anomalies in relation to modelled PM10 emissions, but there were small excess risks associated with congenital heart defects and genital anomalies in proximity to MWIs. These latter findings may well reflect incomplete control for confounding, but a possible causal effect cannot be excluded.

Inference of Naturally Acquired Immunity Using a Self-matched Negative-Control Design	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						natural immunity; frailty; negative control; hazard; self-matched; Mantel-Haenszel		Host adaptive immune responses may protect against infection or disease when a pathogen is repeatedly encountered. The hazard ratio of infection or disease, given previous infection, is typically sought to estimate the strength of protective immunity. However, variation in individual exposure or susceptibility to infection may introduce frailty bias, whereby a tendency for infections to recur among individuals with greater risk confounds the causal association between previous infection and susceptibility. We introduce a self-matched "case-only" inference method to control for unmeasured individual heterogeneity, making use of negative-control endpoints not attributable to the pathogen of interest. To control for confounding, this method compares event times for endpoints due to the pathogen of interest and negative-control endpoints during counterfactual risk periods, defined according to individuals' infection history. We derive a standard Mantel-Haenszel (matched) odds ratio conveying the effect of prior infection on time to recurrence. We compare performance of this approach to several proportional hazards modeling frameworks and estimate statistical power of the proposed strategy under various conditions. In an example application, we use the proposed method to reestimate naturally acquired protection against rotavirus gastroenteritis using data from previously published cohort studies. This self-matched negative-control design may present a flexible alternative to existing approaches for analyzing naturally acquired immunity, as well as other exposures affecting the distribution of recurrent event times.

Colorectal cancer after start of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE			English	Article						colorectal neoplasms; anti-inflammatory agents, nonsteroidal; selection bias; confounding factors (epidemiology); pharmacoepidemiology; epidemiology; chemoprevention	BASE-LINE CHARACTERISTICS; LOW-DOSE ASPIRIN; COLON-CANCER; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; CYCLOOXYGENASE-2 INHIBITOR; BETA-CAROTENE; RISK; PREVENTION; PHYSICIANS; DISEASE	PURPOSE: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs), including aspirin, have been consistently shown to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in non-experimental studies, but little is known of the factors associated with starting and continuing regular NSAID use and their effect on the NSAID and CRC association. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of 22,071 healthy male physicians aged 40 to 84 years without indications or contraindications to regular NSAID use at baseline. Annual questionnaires assessed quantity of NSAID use, occurrence of cancer, and risk factors for CRC. Propensity for regular NSAID use (> 60 days/year) was estimated using generalized estimating equations. We used a time-varying Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the association between duration since initiation of regular NSAID use and risk for CRC. RESULTS: Regular non-aspirin and any NSAID use increased from 0% to 12% and 1% to 56% over time, respectively and was predicted by age, body mass index, alcohol consumption, medication use, coronary artery disease, gastrointestinal diseases, arthritis, hypertension, and headaches. Over a median follow-up of 18 years, 495 physicians were diagnosed with CRC. There was no trend of CRC risk with increased duration of regular NSAID use. Five or more years of regular use of any NSAID were associated with a relative risk for CRC of 1.0 (95% confidence interval: 0.7-1.5), after adjustment for predictors of regular NSAID use. CONCLUSION: Regular NSAID use was not associated with a substantial risk reduction of CRC after controlling for time-varying predictors of both NSAID use and CRC. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Masticatory deficiency thus may be detrimental to health. This article reviews evidence of the effects of masticatory deficiency on nutrition. The selection of relevant literature was based on Medline queries using the following key words: mastication, nutrition, digestion, diet, and disease risk. Earlier work not listed in Medline but related to the subject also was reviewed. Only publications available in English were selected for inclusion. It is difficult to draw conclusions from many of the reviewed studies due to issues related to study design, confounding variables, and the subjective nature of the measurements. In particular, data supporting a link between masticatory function and deficient dietary intake often are based on relatively weak correlations and cannot confer a causal relationship.

Statistical tests are commonly performed one SNP at a time with an assumed mode of inheritance such as recessive, additive, or dominant genetic model. Such analysis can result in inadequate power when the employed model deviates from the underlying true genetic model. We propose an integrative association test procedure under a generalized linear model framework to flexibly model the data from the above three common genetic models and beyond. A computationally efficient resampling procedure is adopted to estimate the null distribution of the proposed test statistic. Simulation results show that our methods maintain the Type I error rate irrespective of the existence of confounding covariates and achieve adequate power compared to the methods with the true genetic model. The new methods are applied to two genetic studies on the resistance of severe malaria and sarcoidosis.

We then turn attention to observational-data situations which are "messy," where modeling that acknowledges the limitations of study design and data collection leads to nonidentifiability. We argue, via a series of examples, that Bayesian interval estimation is an attractive way to proceed in this context even for frequentists, because it can be supplied with a diagnostic in the form of a calibration-sensitivity simulation analysis. We illustrate the basis for this approach in a series of theoretical considerations, simulations and an application to a study of silica exposure and lung cancer.

J	Hoover, DR; Shi, QH; Burstyn, I; Anastos, K				Hoover, Donald R.; Shi, Qiuhu; Burstyn, Igor; Anastos, Kathryn			Repeated Measures Regression in Laboratory, Clinical and Environmental Research: Common Misconceptions in the Matter of Different Within- and Between-Subject Slopes	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						within-; between-subject associations; repeated measures; cross-sectional regression; generalized estimating equations; mixed models; working correlation structure	LONGITUDINAL DATA-ANALYSIS; AIR-POLLUTION; INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL; EXPOSURE; EQUATIONS; CITIES; MODEL; BIAS; GEE	When using repeated measures linear regression models to make causal inference in laboratory, clinical and environmental research, it is typically assumed that the within-subject association of differences (or changes) in predictor variable values across replicates is the same as the between-subject association of differences in those predictor variable values. However, this is often false. For example, with body weight as the predictor variable and blood cholesterol (which increases with higher body fat) as the outcome: (i) a 10-lb. weight increase in the same adult affects more greatly an increase in cholesterol in that adult than does (ii) one adult weighing 10 lbs. more than a second indicate higher cholesterol in the heavier adult. A 10-lb. weight gain in the first adult more likely reflects a build-up of body fat in that person, while a second person being 10 lbs. heavier than the first could be influenced by other factors, such as the second person being taller. Hence, to make causal inferences, different within- and between-subject slopes should be separately modeled. A related misconception commonly made using generalized estimation equations (GEE) and mixed models on repeated measures (i.e., for fitting cross-sectional regression) is that the working correlation structure only influences variance of the parameter estimates. However, only independence working correlation guarantees that the modeled parameters have interpretability. We illustrate this with an example where changing the working correlation from independence to equicorrelation qualitatively biases parameters of GEE models and show that this happens because within- and between-subject slopes for the outcomes regressed on the predictor variables differ. We then systematically describe several common mechanisms that cause within- and between-subject slopes to differ: change effects, lag/reverse-lag and spillover causality, shared within-subject measurement bias or confounding, and predictor variable measurement error.

Repeated measures analyses should compare within- and between-subject slopes of predictors and when they do differ, investigate the causal reasons for this.

J	Gilbert, ES				Gilbert, Ethel S.			THE IMPACT OF DOSIMETRY UNCERTAINTIES ON DOSE-RESPONSE ANALYSES	HEALTH PHYSICS			English	Article						analysis, statistical; dosimetry; epidemiology; National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements	EXPOSURE MEASUREMENT ERROR; LUNG-CANCER; RESIDENTIAL RADON; RADIATION WORKERS; NUCLEAR INDUSTRY; RISK; REANALYSIS; MODEL	Radiation dose estimates. used in epidemiological studies are subject to many sources of uncertainty, and the error structure may be a complicated mixture of different types of error. Increasingly, efforts are being made to evaluate dosimetry uncertainties and to take account of them in statistical analyses. The impact of these uncertainties on dose-response analyses depends on the magnitude and type of error. Errors that are independent from subject to subject (random errors) reduce statistical power for detecting a dose-response relationship, increase uncertainties in estimated risk coefficients, and may lead to underestimation of risk coefficients. The specific effects of random errors depend on whether the errors are "classical" or "Berkson." Classical error can be thought of as error that arises from an imprecise measuring device, whereas Berkson error occurs when a single dose is used to represent a group of subjects (with varying true doses). Uncertainties in quantities that are common to some or all subjects are "shared" uncertainties. Such uncertainties increase the possibility of bias, and accounting for this possibility increases the length of confidence intervals. In studies that provide a direct evaluation of risk at low doses and dose rates, dosimetry errors are more likely to mask a true effect than to create a spurious one. In addition, classical errors and shared dosimetry uncertainties increase the potential for bias in estimated risks coefficients, but this potential may already be large due to the extreme vulnerability to confounding in studies involving very small relative risk.

However, case-control studies may suffer from bias due to population stratification. In this paper, the authors present simple formulas that can set a limit to the havoc population stratification bias can wreak (the lower and upper bounds of the confounding rate ratio and the upper bound of the type I error rate). The authors demonstrate applications of these formulas using two examples. The formulas can help researchers make more prudent interpretations of their (potentially biased) results.

Effects of prenatal bacterial infection on cognitive performance in early childhood	PAEDIATRIC AND PERINATAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						bacterial infection; causal inference; child cognition; inverse probability weighting; neurodevelopment; prenatal infection	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; URINARY-TRACT-INFECTION; CAUSAL INFERENCE; G-COMPUTATION; RISK-FACTORS; FOLLOW-UP; AGE 7; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PREGNANCY; EXPOSURE	Background Previous epidemiologic studies have reported adverse neurodevelopmental sequelae following prenatal infectious exposure, yet long-term effects estimated from these observational studies are often subject to biases due to confounding and loss to follow-up. Objectives We demonstrate the joint use of inverse probability (IP) treatment and censoring weights when evaluating neurotoxic effects of prenatal bacterial infection. Methods We applied IP weighting for both treatment and censoring to estimate the effects of maternal bacterial infection during pregnancy on mean intelligence quotient (IQ) scores measured at age 7 using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. Participants were members of a population-based pregnancy cohort recruited in the Boston and Providence sites of the Collaborative Perinatal Project between 1959 and 1966 (n = 11 984). We calculated average treatment effects (ATE) and average treatment effects on the treated (ATT) using IP weights estimated via generalized boosted models. Results ATE- and ATT-weighted mean IQ scores were lowest among offspring exposed to multi-systemic bacterial infection during pregnancy and highest for those unexposed. The effects of prenatal bacterial infection were greater among male offspring, particularly on performance IQ scores. Offspring who were exposed to multi-systemic bacterial infection in the third trimester displayed the largest reduction in mean full-scale, verbal, and performance IQ scores at age 7 compared to those unexposed or exposed in earlier trimesters. Conclusions We find that prenatal bacterial infection is associated with cognitive impairments at age 7. Associations are strongest for more severe infections, that occur in the third trimester, and among males. Public health intervention targeting bacterial infection in pregnant women may help enhance the cognitive development of offspring.

We used multiple methods to control for confounding and selection bias to estimate the effect of PTR on survival for late-stage PDA. Methods: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 registry database for 2004 through 2014 was retrieved for the present study. A total of 4322 patients with stage III (AJCC, 6th) PDA were included in this study. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to eliminate possible bias. In addition, instrumental variable (IV) analysis was utilized to adjust for both measured and unmeasured confounders. Results: A total of 4322 patients with stage III PDA including 552 (12.8%) who underwent PTR, 3770 (87.2%) without PTR, were identified. In the multivariable cohort, a clear prognostic advantage of PTR was observed in overall survival (OS) (P < 0.001) and disease-specific survival (DSS) (P < 0.001) compared to patients after non-surgery therapy. In the PSM cohort, patients in PTR group showed a better OS and DSS (both P values < 0.001) compared to patients in non-surgery group. The survival benefit of PTR for stage III PDA was not observed in the two-stage residual inclusion (2SRI) model. Estimates based on this instrument indicated that patients treated with PTR had similar OS (P = 0.448) and DSS (P = 0.719). In IV analyses stratified by chemotherapy and tumor location, patients undergoing PTR had similar OS and DSS compared to patients in non-surgery group across all subgroups. Conclusions: Survival with PTR did not differ significantly from palliative treatment in marginal patients with stage III pancreatic adenocarcinoma. High-quality randomized trials are needed to validate these results.

We focus on the potential impact of DDI use, as this drug has not been as studied intensively as ABC. We propose a flexible marginal structural Cox model with weighted cumulative exposure modeling (Cox WCE MSM) to address two key challenges encountered when using observational longitudinal data to assess the adverse effects of medication: (1) the need to model the cumulative effect of a time-dependent treatment and (2) the need to control for time-dependent confounders that also act as mediators of the effect of past treatment. Simulations confirm that the Cox WCE MSM yields accurate estimates of the causal treatment effect given complex exposure effects and time-dependent confounding. We then use the new flexible Cox WCE MSM to assess the association between DDI use and CVD risk in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study. In contrast to the nonsignificant results obtained with conventional parametric Cox MSMs, our new Cox WCE MSM identifies a significant short-term risk increase due to DDI use in the previous year.

We carried out a small-area study in which expected rates of congenital anomalies in births to mothers living within 2 kin of the sites, before and after opening of the sites, were estimated from a logistic regression model fitted to A births in residents living at least 4 km away from these sites and hence not likely to be subject to contamination from a landfill, adjusting for hospital catchment area, year of birth, sex, maternal age, and socioeconomic deprivation score. We investigated all births from 1983 through 1997 with at least one recorded congenital anomaly [International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9), codes 7400-7599; International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), codes QOOO-Q999]. The ratio of the observed to expected rates of congenital anomalies before landfills opened was 0.87 [95% confidence interval (Cl), 0.75-1.00], and this increased to 1.21 (95% CL 1.04-1.40) after opening, giving a standardized risk ratio of 1.39 (95% Cl, 1.12-1.72). Enhanced congenital malformation surveillance data collected from 1998 through 2000 showed a standardized risk ratio of 1.04 (95% CI, 0.88-1.21). Causal inferences are difficult because of possible biases from incomplete case ascertainment, lack of data on individual-level exposures, and other socioeconomic and lifestyle factors that may confound a relationship with area of residence. However, the increase in risk after the sites opened requires continued enhanced surveillance of congenital anomalies, and site-specific chemical exposure studies.

CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW			English	Article						Child protection; Child maltreatment; Service use; Service effect	RISK-FACTORS; INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES; MALTREATMENT RECURRENCE; HISTORY; RECIDIVISM; FAMILY; ABUSE	A number of studies have concluded that there is little observable connection between CPS involvement and improved outcomes for children and families. Evidence of CPS effectiveness is complicated by the presence of selection bias and difficulty controlling for confounding. To understand outcomes by group and intervention effects, comparable groups are necessary and difficult to ascertain using CPS administrative case record data. This study examines the causal effect of CPS involvement on the likelihood of future maltreatment using administrative case management records from July 1, 2010 and June 30, 2011. The current study accounts for differences in pre-existing condition between groups to establish sound estimates of CPS involvement effects. Logistic regression models were used to examine the difference in subsequent substantiated investigation between families with comparable risk and differing service recommendation (p = 0.83), recurrence among families with comparable risk, the same service recommendation that did or did not receive services (p = 0.83). Hazard models were used to explore risk of substantiated investigation among families with comparable risk and differing service recommendation (p = 0.77). Results indicate receipt of CPS services had no observable effect on recurrence of maltreatment overall and among families with similar levels of risk of recurrence. Further inquiry into worker attributes, decision-making, types of and quality of services offered to families could help explain the effective, or ineffectiveness, or services.
