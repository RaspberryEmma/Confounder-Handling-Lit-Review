J	Schnitzer, ME; Lok, JJ; Gruber, S				Schnitzer, Mireille E.; Lok, Judith J.; Gruber, Susan			Variable Selection for Confounder Control, Flexible Modeling and Collaborative Targeted Minimum Loss-Based Estimation in Causal Inference	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOSTATISTICS			English	Article						C-TMLE; IPTW; variable reduction	PROPENSITY SCORE ESTIMATION; SEMIPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION; ADJUSTMENT; CRITERION	This paper investigates the appropriateness of the integration of flexible propensity score modeling (nonparametric or machine learning approaches) in semiparametric models for the estimation of a causal quantity, such as the mean outcome under treatment. We begin with an overview of some of the issues involved in knowledge-based and statistical variable selection in causal inference and the potential pitfalls of automated selection based on the fit of the propensity score. Using a simple example, we directly show the consequences of adjusting for pure causes of the exposure when using inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW). Such variables are likely to be selected when using a naive approach to model selection for the propensity score. We describe how the method of Collaborative Targeted minimum loss-based estimation (C-TMLE; van der Laan and Gruber, 2010 [27]) capitalizes on the collaborative double robustness property of semiparametric efficient estimators to select covariates for the propensity score based on the error in the conditional outcome model. Finally, we compare several approaches to automated variable selection in low-and high-dimensional settings through a simulation study. From this simulation study, we conclude that using IPTW with flexible prediction for the propensity score can result in inferior estimation, while Targeted minimum loss-based estimation and C-TMLE may benefit from flexible prediction and remain robust to the presence of variables that are highly correlated with treatment. However, in our study, standard influence function-based methods for the variance underestimated the standard errors, resulting in poor coverage under certain data-generating scenarios.

Introduction to causal diagrams for confounder selection	RESPIROLOGY			English	Review						causal inference; confounding; directed acyclic graph; observational study	DIRECTED ACYCLIC GRAPHS; BIAS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; MODELS	In respiratory health research, interest often lies in estimating the effect of an exposure on a health outcome. If randomization of the exposure of interest is not possible, estimating its effect is typically complicated by confounding bias. This can often be dealt with by controlling for the variables causing the confounding, if measured, in the statistical analysis. Common statistical methods used to achieve this include multivariable regression models adjusting for selected confounding variables or stratification on those variables. Therefore, a key question is which measured variables need to be controlled for in order to remove confounding. An approach to confounder-selection based on the use of causal diagrams (often called directed acyclic graphs) is discussed. A causal diagram is a visual representation of the causal relationships believed to exist between the variables of interest, including the exposure, outcome and potential confounding variables. After creating a causal diagram for the research question, an intuitive and easy-to-use set of rules can be applied, based on a foundation of rigorous mathematics, to decide which measured variables must be controlled for in the statistical analysis in order to remove confounding, to the extent that is possible using the available data. This approach is illustrated by constructing a causal diagram for the research question: Does personal smoking affect the risk of subsequent asthma?'. Using data taken from the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study, the statistical analysis suggested by the causal diagram approach was performed.

One possible reason is that many research programs involve themes in which there is a certain degree of uncertainty as to mechanisms in the processes that generate the data. In this study, the relationship between occupational stress and obesity is used as an example of the application of causal diagrams to questions related to confounding. The article presents the selection stages for variables in statistical adjustment and the derivation of a causal diagram's statistical implications. The main advantage of causal diagrams is that they explicitly reveal the respective model's underlying hypotheses, allowing critical analysis of the implications and thereby facilitating identification of sources of bias and uncertainty in the epidemiological study's results.

It is then tempting to use statistical variable-selection methods to reduce the number used for adjustment. Nonetheless, there is no agreement on how selection should be conducted, and it is well known that conventional selection methods lead to confidence intervals that are too narrow and p values that are too small. Furthermore, theory and simulation evidence have found no selection method to be uniformly superior to adjusting for all well-measured confounders. Nonetheless, control of all measured confounders can lead to problems for conventional model-fitting methods. When these problems occur, one can apply modern techniques such as shrinkage estimation, exposure modeling, or hybrids that combine outcome and exposure modeling. No selection or special software is needed for most of these techniques. It thus appears that statistical confounder selection may be an unnecessary complication in most regression analyses of effects.

This has led to an interest in developing microbial interventions for treatment of disease and optimization of crop yields which requires identification of microbiome features that impact the outcome in the population of interest. That task is challenging because of the high dimensionality of microbiome data and the confounding that results from the complex and dynamic interactions among host, environment, and microbiome. In the presence of such confounding, variable selection and estimation procedures may have unsatisfactory performance in identifying microbial features with an effect on the outcome. Results In this manuscript, we aim to estimate population-level effects of individual microbiome features while controlling for confounding by a categorical variable. Due to the high dimensionality and confounding-induced correlation between features, we propose feature screening, selection, and estimation conditional on each stratum of the confounder followed by a standardization approach to estimation of population-level effects of individual features. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate the advantages of our approach in recovering relevant features. Utilizing a potential-outcomes framework, we outline assumptions required to ascribe causal, rather than associational, interpretations to the identified microbiome effects. We conducted an agricultural study of the rhizosphere microbiome of sorghum in which nitrogen fertilizer application is a confounding variable. In this study, the proposed approach identified microbial taxa that are consistent with biological understanding of potential plant-microbe interactions. Conclusions Standardization enables more accurate identification of individual microbiome features with an effect on the outcome of interest compared to other variable selection and estimation procedures when there is confounding by a categorical variable.

On the selection of variables in criminology: Adjusting for the descendants of unobserved confounders	JOURNAL OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE			English	Article						Variable selection; Descendants; Causal inference	ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES; ROUTINE ACTIVITIES; VICTIMIZATION; DEPRESSION; CRIME; YOUTH; RATES; RISK	Objectives: The inclusion of variables that: (1) are descendants of unobserved confounders and (2) do not theoretically or empirically cause variation in the constructs of interest in a multivariable regression model can potentially adjust for the bias generated from unobserved confounders. Nevertheless, the validity and utility of descendants for criminological research has yet to be evaluated. Methods: Two studies were developed to address the gap in the literature. First, a randomly specified directed equation simulation analysis was performed. Second, using data from the Pathways to Desistance study, the technique was implemented to observe if the association between gang involvement and criminal involvement was attenuated after adjusting for exposure to violence (a potential descendant of an unobserved confounder).Results: The simulation analysis demonstrated that adjusting for the descendants of unobserved confounders can reduce bias in key estimates. The magnitude of the association between gang involvement and criminal involvement was approximately half of the bivariate association after introducing exposure to violence into the model.Conclusions: The findings suggest that adjusting statistical models for variables that are a descendant of an unobserved confounder and do not cause variation in the association of interest can reduce the bias generated by an unobserved confounder.

J	DeMaris, A				DeMaris, Alfred			Combating Unmeasured Confounding in Cross-Sectional Studies: Evaluating Instrumental-Variable and Heckman Selection Models	PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS			English	Article						instrumental-variables regression; Heckman selection model; Monte Carlo study; causal inference; nonexperimental design	MARITAL-STATUS; MENTAL-HEALTH; COHABITATION; DEPRESSION; MARRIAGE; GENDER; BIAS; BENEFITS; PROBIT	Unmeasured confounding is the principal threat to unbiased estimation of treatment "effects" (i.e., regression parameters for binary regressors) in nonexperimental research. It refers to unmeasured characteristics of individuals that lead them both to be in a particular "treatment" category and to register higher or lower values than others on a response variable. In this article, I introduce readers to 2 econometric techniques designed to control the problem, with a particular emphasis on the Heckman selection model (HSM). Both techniques can be used with only cross-sectional data. Using a Monte Carlo experiment, I compare the performance of instrumental-variable regression (IVR) and HSM to that of ordinary least squares (OLS) under conditions with treatment and unmeasured confounding both present and absent. I find HSM generally to outperform IVR with respect to mean-square-error of treatment estimates, as well as power for detecting either a treatment effect or unobserved confounding. However, both HSM and IVR require a large sample to be fully effective. The use of HSM and IVR in tandem with OLS to untangle unobserved confounding bias in cross-sectional data is further demonstrated with an empirical application. Using data from the 2006 - 2010 General Social Survey (National Opinion Research Center, 2014), I examine the association between being married and subjective well-being.

We illustrated that the covariate selection in the causal inference is different from the variable selection in the ANCOVA model. We then investigated the three criteria of covariate selection for controlling confounding bias, which can be used when we have inadequate information to draw a complete causal graph. VanderWeele and Shpitser (2011) proposed one of them and claimed it was better than the other two. We show by example that their criterion also has limitations and some disadvantages. There is no clear winner; however, their criterion is better (if some correction is made on its condition) than the other two because it can remove the confounding bias.

Building upon work by Wang et al. (2012, Biometrics 68, 661-671) and Lefebvre et al. (2014, Statistics in Medicine 33, 2797-2813), we propose and evaluate a Bayesian method to estimate average causal effects in studies with a large number of potential confounders, relatively few observations, likely interactions between confounders and the exposure of interest, and uncertainty on which confounders and interaction terms should be included. Our method is applicable across all exposures and outcomes that can be handled through generalized linear models. In this general setting, estimation of the average causal effect is different from estimation of the exposure coefficient in the outcome model due to noncollapsibility. We implement a Bayesian bootstrap procedure to integrate over the distribution of potential confounders and to estimate the causal effect. Our method permits estimation of both the overall population causal effect and effects in specified subpopulations, providing clear characterization of heterogeneous exposure effects that may vary considerably across different covariate profiles. Simulation studies demonstrate that the proposed method performs well in small sample size situations with 100-150 observations and 50 covariates. The method is applied to data on 15,060 US Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with a malignant brain tumor between 2000 and 2009 to evaluate whether surgery reduces hospital readmissions within 30 days of diagnosis.

J	Zhang, JJ				Zhang, Jiji			On the completeness of orientation rules for causal discovery in the presence of latent confounders and selection bias	ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						Ancestral graphs; Automated causal discovery; Bayesian networks; Causal models; Markov equivalence; Latent variables	MARKOV EQUIVALENCE; INDEPENDENCE	Causal discovery becomes especially challenging when the possibility of latent confounding and/or selection bias is not assumed away. For this task, ancestral graph models are particularly useful in that they can represent the presence of latent confounding and selection effect, without explicitly invoking unobserved variables. Based on the machinery of ancestral graphs, there is a provably sound causal discovery algorithm, known as the FCI algorithm, that allows the possibility of latent confounders and selection bias. However, the orientation rules used in the algorithm are not complete. In this paper, we provide additional orientation rules, augmented by which the FCI algorithm is shown to be complete, in the sense that it can, under standard assumptions, discover all aspects of the causal structure that are uniquely determined by facts of probabilistic dependence and independence. The result is useful for developing any causal discovery and reasoning system based on ancestral graph models. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Dealing with latent common causes and selection bias for constructing causal models in real data is often necessary because observing all relevant variables is difficult. Ancestral graph models are effective and useful for representing causal models with some information of such latent variables. The causal faithfulness condition, which is usually assumed for determining the models, is known to often be weakly violated in statistical view points for finite data. One of the authors developed a constraint-based causal learning algorithm that is robust against the weak violations while assuming no latent variables. In this study, we applied and extended the thoughts of the algorithm to the inference of ancestral graph models. The practical validity and effectiveness of the algorithm are also confirmed by using some standard datasets in comparison with FCI and RFCI algorithms.

We assume all covariates being considered are pretreatment variables and that for each covariate it is known (i) whether the covariate is a cause of treatment, and (ii) whether the covariate is a cause of the outcome. The causal relationships the covariates have with one another is assumed unknown. We propose that control be made for any covariate that is either a cause of treatment or of the outcome or both. We show that irrespective of the actual underlying causal structure, if any subset of the observed covariates suffices to control for confounding then the set of covariates chosen by our criterion will also suffice. We show that other, commonly used, criteria for confounding control do not have this property. We use formal theory concerning causal diagrams to prove our result but the application of the result does not rely on familiarity with causal diagrams. An investigator simply need ask, Is the covariate a cause of the treatment? and Is the covariate a cause of the outcome? If the answer to either question is yes then the covariate is included for confounder control. We discuss some additional covariate selection results that preserve unconfoundedness and that may be of interest when used with our criterion.

J	Loh, WW; Vansteelandt, S				Loh, Wen Wei; Vansteelandt, Stijn			Confounder selection strategies targeting stable treatment effect estimators	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						covariate selection; double selection; full matching; observational studies; randomization inference	VALID POST-SELECTION; VARIABLE SELECTION; PROPENSITY SCORE; CAUSAL; INFERENCE; UNCERTAINTY; DESIGN	Inferring the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome in an observational study requires adjusting for observed baseline confounders to avoid bias. However, adjusting for all observed baseline covariates, when only a subset are confounders of the effect of interest, is known to yield potentially inefficient and unstable estimators of the treatment effect. Furthermore, it raises the risk of finite-sample bias and bias due to model misspecification. For these stated reasons, confounder (or covariate) selection is commonly used to determine a subset of the available covariates that is sufficient for confounding adjustment. In this article, we propose a confounder selection strategy that focuses on stable estimation of the treatment effect. In particular, when the propensity score (PS) model already includes covariates that are sufficient to adjust for confounding, then the addition of covariates that are associated with either treatment or outcome alone, but not both, should not systematically change the effect estimator. The proposal, therefore, entails first prioritizing covariates for inclusion in the PS model, then using a change-in-estimate approach to select the smallest adjustment set that yields a stable effect estimate. The ability of the proposal to correctly select confounders, and to ensure valid inference of the treatment effect following data-driven covariate selection, is assessed empirically and compared with existing methods using simulation studies. We demonstrate the procedure using three different publicly available datasets commonly used for causal inference.

Nevertheless, backward elimination remains regularly applied. We investigated if and under which conditions causal effect estimation in observational studies can improve by using backward elimination on a prespecified set of potential confounders. An expression was derived that quantifies how variable omission relates to bias and variance of effect estimators. Additionally, 3960 scenarios were defined and investigated by simulations comparing bias and mean squared error (MSE) of the conditional log odds ratio, log(cOR), and the marginal log risk ratio, log(mRR), between full models including all prespecified covariates and backward elimination of these covariates. Applying backward elimination resulted in a mean bias of 0.03 for log(cOR) and 0.02 for log(mRR), compared to 0.56 and 0.52 for log(cOR) and log(mRR), respectively, for a model without any covariate adjustment, and no bias for the full model. In less than 3% of the scenarios considered, the MSE of the log(cOR) or log(mRR) was slightly lower (max 3%) when backward elimination was used compared to the full model. When an initial set of potential confounders can be specified based on background knowledge, there is minimal added value of backward elimination. We advise not to use it and otherwise to provide ample arguments supporting its use.	[Luijken, Kim; Groenwold, Rolf H.

Such methods, however, are challenged by the presence of irrelevant pre-treatment variables and measurement error. Ignoring these features and naively applying the usual inverse probability weighting estimation procedures may typically yield biased inference results. In this article, we develop an inference method for estimating the average treatment effect with those features taken into account. We establish theoretical properties for the resulting estimator and carry out numerical studies to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed estimator.

More recently it has been shown that stratifying on a variable that precedes exposure and disease can induce confounding, even if there is no confounding in the unstratified (crude) estimate. This paper examines the relative magnitudes of these biases under some simple causal models in which the stratification variable is graphically depicted as a collider (a variable directly affected by two or more other variables in the graph). The results suggest that bias from stratifying on variables affected by exposure and disease may often be comparable in size with bias from classical confounding (bias from failing to stratify on a common cause of exposure and disease), whereas other biases from collider stratification may tend to be much smaller.

These phenomena are particularly dangerous in internet-based public health surveillance, where traditional mitigation and adjustment methods are inapplicable, unavailable, or out of date. Recent theoretical advances in causal modeling can mitigate these threats, but these innovations have not been widely deployed in the epidemiological community.Objective: The purpose of our paper is to demonstrate the practical utility of causal modeling to both detect unmeasured confounding and selection bias and guide model selection to minimize bias. We implemented this approach in an applied epidemiological study of the COVID-19 cumulative infection rate in the New York City (NYC) spring 2020 epidemic.Methods: We collected primary data from Qualtrics surveys of Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) crowd workers residing in New Jersey and New York State across 2 sampling periods: April 11-14 and May 8-11, 2020. The surveys queried the subjects on household health status and demographic characteristics. We constructed a set of possible causal models of household infection and survey selection mechanisms and ranked them by compatibility with the collected survey data. The most compatible causal model was then used to estimate the cumulative infection rate in each survey period.Results: There were 527 and 513 responses collected for the 2 periods, respectively. Response demographics were highly skewed toward a younger age in both survey periods. Despite the extremely strong relationship between age and COVID-19 symptoms, we recovered minimally biased estimates of the cumulative infection rate using only primary data and the most compatible causal model, with a relative bias of +3.8% and -1.9% from the reported cumulative infection rate for the first andConclusions: We successfully recovered accurate estimates of the cumulative infection rate from an internet-based crowdsourced sample despite considerable selection bias and unmeasured confounding in the primary data. This implementation demonstrates how simple applications of structural causal modeling can be effectively used to determine falsifiable model conditions, detect selection bias and confounding factors, and minimize estimate bias through model selection in a novel epidemiological context. As the disease and social dynamics of COVID-19 continue to evolve, public health surveillance protocols must continue to adapt; the emergence of Omicron variants and shift to at-home testing as recent challenges. Rigorous and transparent methods to develop, deploy, and diagnosis adapted surveillance protocols will be critical to their success.

Selection of confounding variables should not be based on observed associations with exposure	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Bias; Confounder selection; Confounding; Pharmacoepidemiology	CLINICAL-TRIALS; MODELS; BIAS	In observational studies, selection of confounding variables for adjustment is often based on observed baseline incomparability. The aim of this study was to evaluate this selection strategy. We used clinical data on the effects of inhaled long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) use on the risk of mortality among patients with obstructive pulmonary disease to illustrate the impact of selection of confounding variables for adjustment based on baseline comparisons. Among 2,394 asthma and COPD patients included in the analyses, the LABA ever-users were considerably older than never-users, but cardiovascular co-morbidity was equally prevalent (19.9% vs. 19.9%). Adjustment for cardiovascular co-morbidity status did not affect the crude risk ratio (RR) for mortality: crude RR 1.19 (95% CI 0.93-1.51) versus RR 1.19 (95% CI 0.94-1.50) after adjustment for cardiovascular co-morbidity. However, after adjustment for age (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76-1.19), additional adjustment for cardiovascular co-morbidity status did affect the association between LABA use and mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.80-1.26). Confounding variables should not be discarded based on balanced distributions among exposure groups, because residual confounding due to the omission of confounding variables from the adjustment model can be relevant.

J	Loh, WW; Ren, DN				Loh, Wen Wei; Ren, Dongning			Data-Driven Covariate Selection for Confounding Adjustment by Focusing on the Stability of the Effect Estimator	PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS			English	Article; Early Access						causal inference; double selection; observational studies; propensity scores; strong ignorability	DOUBLY ROBUST ESTIMATION; PROPENSITY SCORE; CAUSAL INFERENCE; VARIABLE SELECTION; MODEL-SELECTION; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; BIAS REDUCTION; REGRESSION; LASSO; MISSPECIFICATION	Valid inference of cause-and-effect relations in observational studies necessitates adjusting for common causes of the focal predictor (i.e., treatment) and the outcome. When such common causes, henceforth termed confounders, remain unadjusted for, they generate spurious correlations that lead to biased causal effect estimates. But routine adjustment for all available covariates, when only a subset are truly confounders, is known to yield potentially inefficient and unstable estimators. In this article, we introduce a data-driven confounder selection strategy that focuses on stable estimation of the treatment effect. The approach exploits the causal knowledge that after adjusting for confounders to eliminate all confounding biases, adding any remaining non-confounding covariates associated with only treatment or outcome, but not both, should not systematically change the effect estimator. The strategy proceeds in two steps. First, we prioritize covariates for adjustment by probing how strongly each covariate is associated with treatment and outcome. Next, we gauge the stability of the effect estimator by evaluating its trajectory adjusting for different covariate subsets. The smallest subset that yields a stable effect estimate is then selected. Thus, the strategy offers direct insight into the (in)sensitivity of the effect estimator to the chosen covariates for adjustment. The ability to correctly select confounders and yield valid causal inferences following data-driven covariate selection is evaluated empirically using extensive simulation studies. Furthermore, we compare the introduced method empirically with routine variable selection methods. Finally, we demonstrate the procedure using two publicly available real-world datasets. A step-by-step practical guide with user-friendly R functions is included.

Even though the ability to deal with a large number of potential covariates can render selection-on-observables assumptions more plausible, there is at the same time a growing risk that endogenous variables are included, which would lead to the violation of conditional independence. This article demonstrates that DML is very sensitive to the inclusion of only a few "bad controls" in the covariate space. The resulting bias varies with the nature of the theoretical causal model, which raises concerns about the feasibility of selecting control variables in a data-driven way.

The modelling approach typically involves selecting both a lag at which the effect of particulates should be evaluated and a level of filtering to remove long-term associations confounded with seasonal variations and secular trend. In this paper we investigate the bias introduced by model selection and residual confounding using simulations based on a previous analysis of data from King County, Washington. In comparison with the original analyses we find that the bias is small in absolute terms but of the same order as the estimated health impacts. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Marginal structural models are a flexible new set of causal models. The estimation methods used to estimate model parameters use weighting to control for confounding; this allows more flexibility in choosing covariates for inclusion in the structural model and allows the model to more precisely reflect the scientific questions of interest. An important example of this is in multicenter observational studies where there is confounding by cluster. We illustrate these points with data from a study of surgery to provide vascular access for hemodialysis and a study comparing different timings for coronary angioplasty.

The authors compared the performance of several such strategies for fitting multiplicative Poisson regression models to cohort data: 1)the ''change-in-estimate'' strategy, in which a variable is controlled if the adjusted and unadjusted estimates differ by some important amount; 2) the ''significance-test-of-the-covariate'' strategy, in which a variable is controlled if its coefficient is significantly different from zero at some predetermined significance level; 3) the ''significance-test-of-the-difference'' strategy, wh ich tests the difference between the adjusted and unadjusted exposure coefficients; 4) the ''equivalence-test-of-the-difference'' strategy, which significance-tests the equivalence of the adjusted and unadjusted exposure coefficients; and 5) a hybrid strategy that takes a weighted average of adjusted and unadjusted estimates. Data were generated from 8,100 population structures at each of several sample sizes. The performance of the different strategies was evaluated by computing bias, mean squared error, and coverage rates of confidence intervals. At least one variation of each strategy that was examined performed acceptably. The change-in-estimate and equivalence-test-of-the-difference strategies performed best when the cut-point for deciding whether crude and adjusted estimates differed by an important amount was set to a low value (10%). The significance test strategies performed best when the alpha level was set to much higher than conventional levels (0.20).

We illustrate these limitations in the case of random confounding and designs that prevent such confounding. In many experimental designs individual treatment allocations are dependent, and explicit population models are needed to show this dependency. In particular, certain designs impose unfaithful covariate-treatment distributions to prevent random confounding, yet ordinary causal graphs cannot discriminate between these unconfounded designs and confounded studies. Causal models for populations are better suited for displaying these phenomena than are individual-level models, because they allow representation of allocation dependencies as well as outcome dependencies across individuals. Nonetheless, even with this extension, ordinary graphical models still fail to capture distinctions between hypothetical superpopulations (sampling distributions) and observed populations (actual distributions), although potential-outcome models can be adapted to show these distinctions and their consequences.

First, we derive model identifiability under the sublinear growth assumption. Then, we propose a novel method, named the Deconfounded Functional Structure Estimation (DeFuSE), consisting of a deconfounding adjustment to remove the confounding effects and a sequential procedure to estimate the causal order of variables. We implement DeFuSE via feedforward neural networks for scalable computation. Moreover, we establish the consistency of DeFuSE under an assumption called the strong causal minimality. In simulations, DeFuSE compares favorably against state-of-the-art competitors that ignore confounding or nonlinearity. Finally, we demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of the proposed approach with an application to gene regulatory network analysis.

METHODS: Confounders were selected by using backward elimination (BE), change in estimate (CIE) method, Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and an empirical approach using a priori information. A modified ridge regression estimator, which shrinks effects of confounders toward zero, also was considered. For each criterion, uncertainty in the estimated exposure effect was assessed by using bootstrap simulations for which confounders were selected in each sample. These methods were illustrated by using data for mercury neurotoxicity in Faroe Islands children. Point estimates and standard errors of mercury effects on confounder-sensitive neurobehavioral outcomes were calculated for each selection procedure. RESULTS: The full model and the empirical a priori model showed approximately the same precision, and these methods were (slightly) inferior to only modified ridge regression. Lower precisions were obtained by using BE with a low cutoff level, BIC, and CIE. CONCLUSIONS: Standard analysis ignores model selection uncertainty and is likely to yield overoptimistic inferences. Thus, the traditional BE procedure with p = 5% should be avoided. If data-dependent procedures are required for confounder identification, we recommend that inferences be based on bootstrap statistics to describe the selection process.

The authors present findings from the Slone Epidemiology Unit Birth Defects Study, 1992-1997, a case-control study on folic acid supplementation and risk of neural tube defects. When statistical strategies for confounding evaluation are used, the adjusted odds ratio is 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.62, 1.21). However, the consideration of a priori causal knowledge suggests that the crude odds ratio of 0.65 (95% confidence interval: 0.46, 0.94) should be used because the adjusted odds ratio is invalid. Causal diagrams are used to encode qualitative a priori subject matter knowledge.

Time-Dependent Confounding in the Estimation of Treatment Effects in Randomised Trials with Multimodal Therapies - An Illustration of the Problem of Time-Dependent Confounding by Causal Graphs	GESUNDHEITSWESEN			German	Article						time-dependent confounding; selection bias; randomised trials; causal inference; directed acyclic graphs	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; INTENT-TO-TREAT	Biased effect estimates induced by unconsidered confounding variables are a known problem in observational studies. Selection bias, resulting from non-random sampling of study participants, is widely recognised as a problem in case-control and cross-sectional studies. In contrast, possible bias in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is mostly ignored. This paper illustrates, by applying directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), possible bias in the effect estimates of first-line therapy, caused by subsequent changes in therapy (time-dependent confounding). Possible selection bias, induced by not only random loss to follow-up, will be explained as well using DAGs. Underlying assumptions of standard methods usually used to analyse RCTs (like intention-to-treat, per-protocol) are shown and it is explained why effect estimates may be biased in RCTs, if only these conventional methods are used. Adequate statistical methods (causal inference models as marginal structural models and structural nested models) exist. Higher documentary efforts, however, are necessary, because any changes in medication, loss to follow-up as well as reasons for such changes need to be documented in detail as required by these advanced statistical methods. Nevertheless, causal inference models should become standard along side the currently applied standard methods, especially in studies with high non-compliance due to changes in therapy and substantial loss to follow-up. Possible bias cannot be excluded if similar results are obtained from both methods. However, study results should be interpreted with caution if they differ between both approaches.	[Zietemann, V.

Recent theoretical and methodological developments have helped clarify a number of principles of confounder selection. When complete knowledge of a causal diagram relating all covariates to each other is available, graphical rules can be used to make decisions about covariate control. Unfortunately, such complete knowledge is often unavailable. This paper puts forward a practical approach to confounder selection decisions when thesomewhat less stringent assumption is made that knowledge is available for each covariate whether it is a cause of the exposure, and whether it is a cause of the outcome. Based on recent theoretically justified developments in the causal inference literature, the following proposal is made for covariate control decisions: control for each covariate that is a cause of the exposure, or of the outcome, or of both; exclude from this set any variable known to be an instrumental variable; and include as a covariate any proxy for an unmeasured variable that is a common cause of both the exposure and the outcome. Various principles of confounder selection are then further related to statistical covariate selection methods.

We allow the missingness of the confounders to be nonignorable; that is, the missingness may depend on the missing confounders, conditional on the observed data. The identification has been discussed in the literature; however, few studies have focused on semiparametric causal inference with nonignorably missing confounders. To address this, we propose three semiparametric estimators: the inverse probability weighting (IPW), regression, and doubly robust (DR) estimators. The IPW and regression estimators require a correct specification of the propensity scores and the regression models for the confounders and outcome, respectively. Assuming the selection bias odds ratio function is always correctly specified, the DR estimator uses both sets of models and is consistent if either set of models, but not necessarily both, is correctly specified. We investigate the finite-sample performance of our proposed semiparametric estimators using simulation studies and apply our estimators to SO2 emissions data.

Alzheimer's Dis Neuroimaging	Frameworks for estimating causal effects in observational settings: comparing confounder adjustment and instrumental variables	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Review						Causal inference; Observational studies; Instrumental variables; Adjustment; Propensity scores	PROPENSITY SCORE; BIAS; INFERENCE; MODELS; REGRESSION; DONEPEZIL; POSITIVITY; SELECTION; TESTS	To estimate causal effects, analysts performing observational studies in health settings utilize several strategies to mitigate bias due to confounding by indication. There are two broad classes of approaches for these purposes: use of confounders and instrumental variables (IVs). Because such approaches are largely characterized by untestable assumptions, analysts must operate under an indefinite paradigm that these methods will work imperfectly. In this tutorial, we formalize a set of general principles and heuristics for estimating causal effects in the two approaches when the assumptions are potentially violated. This crucially requires reframing the process of observational studies as hypothesizing potential scenarios where the estimates from one approach are less inconsistent than the other. While most of our discussion of methodology centers around the linear setting, we touch upon complexities in non-linear settings and flexible procedures such as target minimum loss-based estimation and double machine learning. To demonstrate the application of our principles, we investigate the use of donepezil off-label for mild cognitive impairment. We compare and contrast results from confounder and IV methods, traditional and flexible, within our analysis and to a similar observational study and clinical trial.	[Zawadzki, Roy S.

Alan			Bias testing, bias correction, and confounder selection using an instrumental variable model	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						bias correction; bias equivalence; confounding bias; instrumental variable; ordinary least squares	REGRESSION	Instrumental variable (IV) analysis can be used to address bias due to unobserved confounding when estimating the causal effect of a treatment on an outcome of interest. However, if a proposed IV is correlated with unmeasured confounders and/or weakly correlated with the treatment, the standard IV estimator may be more biased than an ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator. Several methods have been proposed that compare the bias of the IV and OLS estimators relying on the belief that measured covariates can be used as proxies for the unmeasured confounder. Despite these developments, there is lack of discussion about approaches that can be used to formally test whether the IV estimator may be less biased than the OLS estimator. Thus, we have developed a testing framework to compare the bias and a criterion to select informative measured covariates for bias comparison and regression adjustment. We also have developed a bias-correction method, which allows one to use an invalid IV to correct the bias of the OLS or IV estimator. Numerical studies demonstrate that the proposed methods perform well with realistic sample sizes.

A comparison of confounder selection and adjustment methods for estimating causal effects using large healthcare databases	PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY			English	Article						algorithms; biostatistics; confounding factors; machine learning; pharmacoepidemiology; propensity score	DIMENSIONAL PROPENSITY SCORE; COVARIATE SELECTION; VARIABLE SELECTION; MODEL-SELECTION; SUPER LEARNER; INFERENCE; PREDICTION; LASSO; BIAS	Purpose Confounding adjustment is required to estimate the effect of an exposure on an outcome in observational studies. However, variable selection and unmeasured confounding are particularly challenging when analyzing large healthcare data. Machine learning methods may help address these challenges. The objective was to evaluate the capacity of such methods to select confounders and reduce unmeasured confounding bias. Methods A simulation study with known true effects was conducted. Completely synthetic and partially synthetic data incorporating real large healthcare data were generated. We compared Bayesian adjustment for confounding (BAC), generalized Bayesian causal effect estimation (GBCEE), Group Lasso and Doubly robust estimation, high-dimensional propensity score (hdPS), and scalable collaborative targeted maximum likelihood algorithms. For the hdPS, two adjustment approaches targeting the effect in the whole population were considered: Full matching and inverse probability weighting. Results In scenarios without hidden confounders, most methods were essentially unbiased. The bias and variance of the hdPS varied considerably according to the number of variables selected by the algorithm. In scenarios with hidden confounders, substantial bias reduction was achieved by using machine-learning methods to identify proxies as compared to adjusting only by observed confounders. hdPS and Group Lasso performed poorly in the partially synthetic simulation. BAC, GBCEE, and scalable collaborative-targeted maximum likelihood algorithms performed particularly well. Conclusions Machine learning can help to identify measured confounders in large healthcare databases. They can also capitalize on proxies of unmeasured confounders to substantially reduce residual confounding bias.

J	Kim, C; Tec, M; Zigler, C				Kim, Chanmin; Tec, Mauricio; Zigler, Corwin			Bayesian nonparametric adjustment of confounding	BIOMETRICS			English	Article						air pollution; BART; Bayesian nonparametrics; causal inference; confounder selection	VARIABLE SELECTION; PROPENSITY SCORE; UNCERTAINTY	Analysis of observational studies increasingly confronts the challenge of determining which of a possibly high-dimensional set of available covariates are required to satisfy the assumption of ignorable treatment assignment for estimation of causal effects. We propose a Bayesian nonparametric approach that simultaneously (1) prioritizes inclusion of adjustment variables in accordance with existing principles of confounder selection; (2) estimates causal effects in a manner that permits complex relationships among confounders, exposures, and outcomes; and (3) provides causal estimates that account for uncertainty in the nature of confounding. The proposal relies on specification of multiple Bayesian additive regression trees models, linked together with a common prior distribution that accrues posterior selection probability to covariates on the basis of association with both the exposure and the outcome of interest. A set of extensive simulation studies demonstrates that the proposed method performs well relative to similarly-motivated methodologies in a variety of scenarios. We deploy the method to investigate the causal effect of emissions from coal-fired power plants on ambient air pollution concentrations, where the prospect of confounding due to local and regional meteorological factors introduces uncertainty around the confounding role of a high-dimensional set of measured variables. Ultimately, we show that the proposed method produces more efficient and more consistent results across adjacent years than alternative methods, lending strength to the evidence of the causal relationship between SO2 emissions and ambient particulate pollution.

Furthermore, some population characteristics (e.g., age, race, and socioeconomic status) might play a crucial role in understanding vulnerability to air pollution. To inform policy, it is necessary to identify groups of the population that are more or less vulnerable to air pollution. In causal inference literature, the group average treatment effect (GATE) is a distinctive facet of the conditional average treatment effect. This widely employed metric serves to characterize the heterogeneity of a treatment effect based on some population characteristics. In this paper, we introduce a novel Confounder-Dependent Bayesian Mixture Model (CDBMM) to characterize causal effect heterogeneity. More specifically, our method leverages the flexibility of the dependent Dirichlet process to model the distribution of the potential outcomes conditionally to the covariates and the treatment levels, thus enabling us to: (i) identify heterogeneous and mutually exclusive population groups defined by similar GATEs in a data-driven way, and (ii) estimate and characterize the causal effects within each of the identified groups. Through simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in uncovering key insights about treatment effects heterogeneity. We apply our method to claims data from Medicare enrollees in Texas. We found six mutually exclusive groups where the causal effects of pm 2.5 on mortality rate are heterogeneous.

Consistent causal effect estimation under dual misspecification and implications for confounder selection procedures	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						collaborative double robustness; TMLE; collaborative targeted maximum likelihood estimation; propensity score; confounder selection; causal effect; causal inference; dual misspecification	INFERENCE	In a previously published article in this journal, Vansteeland et al. [Stat Methods Med Res. Epub ahead of print 12 November 2010. DOI: 10.1177/0962280210387717] address confounder selection in the context of causal effect estimation in observational studies. They discuss several selection strategies and propose a procedure whose performance is guided by the quality of the exposure effect estimator. The authors note that when a particular linearity condition is met, consistent estimation of the target parameter can be achieved even under dual misspecification of models for the association of confounders with exposure and outcome and demonstrate the performance of their procedure relative to other estimators when this condition holds. Our earlier published work on collaborative targeted minimum loss based learning provides a general theoretical framework for effective confounder selection that explains the findings of Vansteelandt etal. and underscores the appropriateness of their suggestions that a confounder selection procedure should be concerned with directly targeting the quality of the estimate and that desirable estimators produce valid confidence intervals and are robust to dual misspecification.

It is done by including them in propensity score model in so-called potential outcome framework for causal inference whereas in causal graphical modeling framework usual conditioning on them is done. However in the former framework, it is confusing when modeler finds a variable that is non-causally associated with both the treatment and the outcome. Some argue that such variables should also be included in the analysis for removing bias. But others argue that they introduce no bias so they should be excluded and conditioning on them introduces spurious dependence between the treatment and the outcome, thus resulting extra bias in the estimation. We show that there may be errors in both the arguments in different contexts. When such a variable is found neither of the actions may give the correct causal effect estimate. Selecting one action over the other is needed in order to be less wrong. We discuss how to select the better action.

Previous studies have extended mediation models with a single mediator to high-dimensional mediators selection. It is often assumed that there are no confounders that influence the relations among the exposure, mediator, and outcome. This is not realistic for the observational studies. To accommodate the potential confounders, we propose a concise and efficient high-dimensional mediation analysis procedure using the propensity score for adjustment. Results from simulation studies demonstrate the proposed procedure has good performance in mediator selection and effect estimation compared with methods that ignore all confounders. Of note, as the sample size increases, the performance of variable selection and mediation effect estimation is as well as the results shown in the method which include all confounders as covariates in the mediation model. By applying this procedure to a TCGA lung cancer data set, we find that lung cancer patients who had serious smoking history have increased the risk of death via the methylation markers cg21926276 and cg20707991 with significant hazard ratios of 1.2093 (95% CI: 1.2019-1.2167) and 1.1388 (95% CI: 1.1339-1.1438), respectively.

Variable Selection for Confounding Adjustment in High-dimensional Covariate Spaces When Analyzing Healthcare Databases	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							PROPENSITY-SCORE; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; SIMULATION; SHRINKAGE; EVENTS; NUMBER; SAFETY; BIAS	Background: Data-adaptive approaches to confounding adjustment may improve performance beyond expert knowledge when analyzing electronic healthcare databases and have additional practical advantages for analyzing multiple databases in rapid cycles. Improvements seemed possible if outcome predictors were reliably identified empirically and adjusted. Methods: In five cohort studies from diverse healthcare databases, we implemented a base-case high-dimensional propensity score algorithm with propensity score decile-adjusted outcome models to estimate treatment effects among prescription drug initiators. The original variable selection procedure based on the estimated bias of each variable using unadjusted associations between confounders and exposure (RRCE) and disease outcome (RRCD) was augmented by alternative strategies. These included using increasingly adjusted RRCD estimates, including models considering > 1,500 variables jointly (Lasso, Bayesian logistic regression); using prediction statistics or likelihood-ratio statistics for covariate prioritization; directly estimating the propensity score with > 1,500 variables (Lasso, Bayesian regression); or directly fitting an outcome model using all covariates jointly (Lasso, Ridge). Results: In five example studies, most tested augmentations of the base-case hdPS did not meaningfully change estimates in light of wide confidence intervals except for Bayesian regression and Lasso to estimate RRCD, which moved estimates minimally closer to the expectation in three of five examples. The direct outcome estimation with Lasso performed worst. Conclusion: Overall, the basic heuristic of variable reduction in highdimensional propensity score adjustment performed, as well as alternative approaches in diverse settings. Minor improvements in variable selection may be possible using Bayesian outcome regression to prioritize variables for propensity score estimation when outcomes are rare.

This problem is exacerbated in high-dimensional settings, where variable selection becomes unavoidable. This has prompted a flurry of activity in developing uniformly valid hypothesis tests for a low-dimensional regression parameter (eg, the causal effect of an exposure A on an outcome Y) in high-dimensional models. So far there has been limited focus on model misspecification, although this is inevitable in high-dimensional settings. We propose tests of the null that are uniformly valid under sparsity conditions weaker than those typically invoked in the literature, assuming working models for the exposure and outcome are both correctly specified. When one of the models is misspecified, by amending the procedure for estimating the nuisance parameters, our tests continue to be valid; hence, they are doubly robust.

We present a two-step approach for exposure selection with subsequent confounder adjustment for statistical inference. Methods: We measured cognitive ability in 338 children using the Woodcock-Mun similar to oz General Intellectual Ability (GIA) score, and potential associated features across several environmental domains. Initially, 111 variables theoretically associated with GIA score were introduced into a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) in a 50% feature selection subsample. Effect estimates for selected features were subsequently modeled in linear regressions in a 50% inference (hold out) subsample, first adjusting for sex and age and later for covariates selected via directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). All models were adjusted for clustering by school. Results: Of the 15 LASSO selected variables, eleven were not associated with GIA score following our inference modeling approach. Four variables were associated with GIA scores, including: serum ferritin adjusted for inflammation (inversely), mother's IQ (positively), father's education (positively), and hours per day the child works on homework (positively). Serum ferritin was not in the expected direction. Conclusions: Our two-step approach moves high-dimensional feature selection a step further by incorporating DAG-based confounder adjustment for statistical inference.

If there is sufficient knowledge on the underlying causal structure then existing confounder selection criteria can be used to select subsets of the observed pretreatment covariates, X, sufficient for unconfoundedness, if such subsets exist. Here, estimation of these target subsets is considered when the underlying causal structure is unknown. The proposed method is to model the causal structure by a probabilistic graphical model, for example, a Markov or Bayesian network, estimate this graph from observed data and select the target subsets given the estimated graph. The approach is evaluated by simulation both in a high-dimensional setting where unconfoundedness holds given X and in a setting where unconfoundedness only holds given subsets of X. Several common target subsets are investigated and the selected subsets are compared with respect to accuracy in estimating the average causal effect. The proposed method is implemented with existing software that can easily handle high-dimensional data, in terms of large samples and large number of covariates. The results from the simulation study show that, if unconfoundedness holds given X, this approach is very successful in selecting the target subsets, outperforming alternative approaches based on random forests and LASSO, and that the subset estimating the target subset containing all causes of outcome yields smallest MSE in the average causal effect estimation.

If the number of the potential confounders (p) is larger than the number of observations (n), then direct control for all potential confounders is infeasible. Existing approaches for dimension reduction and penalization are generally aimed at predicting the outcome, and are less suited for estimation of causal effects. Under standard penalization approaches (e.g. Lasso), if a variable X-j is strongly associated with the treatment T but weakly with the outcome Y, the coefficient beta(j) will be shrunk towards zero thus leading to confounding bias. Under the assumption of a linear model for the outcome and sparsity, we propose continuous spike and slab priors on the regression coefficients beta(j) corresponding to the potential confounders X-j. Specifically, we introduce a prior distribution that does not heavily shrink to zero the coefficients (beta(j)s) of the X(j)s that are strongly associated with T but weakly associated with Y. We compare our proposed approach to several state of the art methods proposed in the literature. Our proposed approach has the following features: 1) it reduces confounding bias in high dimensional settings; 2) it shrinks towards zero coefficients of instrumental variables; and 3) it achieves good coverages even in small sample sizes. We apply our approach to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data to estimate the causal effects of persistent pesticide exposure on triglyceride levels.

Confounding, causality, and confusion: the role of intermediate variables in interpreting observational studies in obstetrics	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY			English	Article						causal pathway; collider stratification bias; confounder; descending proxy; inappropriate adjustment; intermediate variable; overadjustment; perinatal paradox; selection bias; unmeasured confounding	BIRTH-WEIGHT; PERINATAL-MORTALITY; GESTATIONAL-AGE; CEREBRAL-PALSY; PRETERM BIRTH; BIAS; PREECLAMPSIA; DIAGRAMS; RISK; FETAL	Prospective and retrospective cohorts and case-control studies are some of the most important study designs in epidemiology because, under certain assumptions, they can mimic a randomized trial when done well. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, properly accounting for 2 important sources of bias: confounding and selection bias. While not adjusting the causal association for an intermediate variable will yield an unbiased estimate of the exposure-outcome's total causal effect, it is often that obstetricians will want to adjust for an intermediate variable to assess if the intermediate is the underlying driver of the association. Such a practice must be weighed in light of the underlying research question and whether such an adjustment is necessary should be carefully considered. Gestational age is, by far, the most commonly encountered variable in obstetrics that is often mislabeled as a confounder when, in fact, it may be an intermediate. If, indeed, gestational age is an intermediate but if mistakenly labeled as a confounding variable and consequently adjusted in an analysis, the conclusions can be unexpected. The implications of this overadjustment of an intermediate as though it were a confounder can render an otherwise persuasive study downright meaningless. This commentary provides an exposition of confounding bias, collider stratification, and selection biases, with applications in obstetrics and perinatal epidemiology.

Adjustment for time-invariant and time-varying confounders in 'unexplained residuals' models for longitudinal data within a causal framework and associated challenges	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Unexplained residuals model; conditional regression model; conditional analysis; conditional growth; conditional weight; conditional size; directed acyclic graph; causal inference; lifecourse epidemiology	CATCH-UP GROWTH; BLOOD-PRESSURE; WEIGHT-GAIN; FETAL ORIGINS; BIRTH-WEIGHT; INFANT GROWTH; BODY-COMPOSITION; EARLY-LIFE; CHILDHOOD; OUTCOMES	'Unexplained residuals' models have been used within lifecourse epidemiology to model an exposure measured longitudinally at several time points in relation to a distal outcome. It has been claimed that these models have several advantages, including: the ability to estimate multiple total causal effects in a single model, and additional insight into the effect on the outcome of greater-than-expected increases in the exposure compared to traditional regression methods. We evaluate these properties and prove mathematically how adjustment for confounding variables must be made within this modelling framework. Importantly, we explicitly place unexplained residual models in a causal framework using directed acyclic graphs. This allows for theoretical justification of appropriate confounder adjustment and provides a framework for extending our results to more complex scenarios than those examined in this paper. We also discuss several interpretational issues relating to unexplained residual models within a causal framework. We argue that unexplained residual models offer no additional insights compared to traditional regression methods, and, in fact, are more challenging to implement; moreover, they artificially reduce estimated standard errors. Consequently, we conclude that unexplained residual models, if used, must be implemented with great care.	[Arnold, K. F.; Ellison, G. T. H.; Tennant, P. W. G.; Heppenstall, A.; Gilthorpe, M.

J	Hoffman, TD; Kedron, P				Hoffman, Tyler D.; Kedron, Peter			Controlling for spatial confounding and spatial interference in causal inference: modelling insights from a computational experiment	ANNALS OF GIS			English	Article						Spatial causal inference; spatial confounding; spatial interference; modelling guidance	ISSUES	Causal inference is a rapidly growing field of statistics that applies logical reasoning to statistical inference to estimate causal relationships. Spatial data poses several problems in causal inference namely, spatial confounding and interference - that require different strategies when designing causal models. In order to obtain valid inferences, existing nonspatial causal models must adjust for such spatial problems. Given the blossoming literature on spatial causal inference, this research analyzes the usage of spatial causal models under a priori knowledge and a priori ignorance of the spatial structure of data. We synthesize existing research directions in noncausal spatial modelling and causal nonspatial modelling by assessing the performance of 28 spatial causal models across 16 spatial data scenarios. We used ordinary least squares (OLS) models, conditional auto-regressive (CAR) models, and jointly CAR models for outcome and treatment variables as the basis for the tested models, equipping them with a variety of spatial causal adjustments. We compare our results to principles of noncausal spatial modelling and investigate their implications for spatial causal modelling. Specifically, we show that noncausal spatial modelling guidance holds in causal spatial modelling workflows and demonstrate how researchers can leverage noncausal theory to great effect. In parallel, we introduce the spycause Python package of spatial causal models and data simulators to facilitate the widespread use of these models and to enable reproduction and extension of our work.

J	Wiedermann, W; Sebastian, J				Wiedermann, Wolfgang; Sebastian, James			Direction Dependence Analysis in the Presence of Confounders: Applications to Linear Mediation Models Using Observational Data	MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Direction of dependence; confounder; mediation; non-normality	CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION; SELECTION BIAS; CAUSAL-MODELS; REGRESSION; KURTOSIS; SKEWNESS; SCORE; STATISTICS; LEADERSHIP; PATHWAYS	Statistical methods to identify mis-specifications of linear regression models with respect to the direction of dependence (i.e. whether or better approximates the data-generating mechanism) have received considerable attention. Direction dependence analysis (DDA) constitutes such a statistical tool and makes use of higher-moment information of variables to derive statements concerning directional model mis-specifications in observational data. Previous studies on direction of dependence mainly focused on statistical inference and guidelines for the selection from the two directionally competing candidate models ( versus ) while assuming the absence of unobserved common causes. The present study describes properties of DDA when confounders are present and extends existing DDA methodology by incorporating the confounder model as a possible explanation. We show that all three explanatory models can be uniquely identified under standard DDA assumptions. Further, we discuss the proposed approach in the context of testing competing mediation models and evaluate an organizational model proposing a mediational relation between school leadership and student achievement via school safety using observational data from an urban school district. Overall, DDA provides strong empirical support that school safety has indeed a causal effect on student achievement but suggests that important confounders are present in the school leadership-safety relation.

We consider estimating the effect of a multivariate exposure that includes several continuous agents and their interactionson an outcome, when the true confounding variables are an unknown subset of a potentially large (relative to sample size) set of measured covariates. Our approach is rooted in the ideas of Bayesian model averaging: the exposure effect is estimated as a weighted average of the estimated exposure effects obtained under several linear regression models that include different sets of the potential confounders. We introduce a data-driven prior that assigns to the likely confounders a higher probability of being included into the regression model. We show that our approach can also be formulated as a penalized likelihood formulation with an interpretable tuning parameter. Through a simulation study, we demonstrate that the proposed approach identifies parsimonious models that are fully adjusted for observed confounding and estimates the multivariate exposure effect with smaller mean squared error compared to several alternatives. We apply the method to an Environmental Wide Association Study using National Heath and Nutrition Examination Survey to estimate the effect of mixtures of nutrients and pesticides on lipid levels.

Although the principles behind confounder selection are now well established, variable selection for confounder adjustment remains a difficult problem in practice, particularly in secondary analyses of databases. We present a simulation study that compares the high-dimensional propensity score algorithm for variable selection with approaches that utilize direct adjustment for all potential confounders via regularized regression, including ridge regression and lasso regression. Simulations were based on 2 previously published pharmacoepidemiologic cohorts and used the plasmode simulation framework to create realistic simulated data sets with thousands of potential confounders. Performance of methods was evaluated with respect to bias and mean squared error of the estimated effects of a binary treatment. Simulation scenarios varied the true underlying outcome model, treatment effect, prevalence of exposure and outcome, and presence of unmeasured confounding. Across scenarios, high-dimensional propensity score approaches generally performed better than regularized regression approaches. However, including the variables selected by lasso regression in a regular propensity score model also performed well and may provide a promising alternative variable selection method.

Confounding bias threatens the reliability of studies using such data. The successful control of confounding requires knowledge of variables called confounders affecting both the exposure and outcome of interest. However, causal knowledge of dynamic biological systems is complex and challenging. Fortunately, computable knowledge mined from the literature may hold clues about confounders. In this paper, we tested the hypothesis that incorporating literaturederived confounders can improve causal inference from observational data. Methods: We introduce two methods (semantic vector-based and string-based confounder search) that query literature-derived information for confounder candidates to control, using SemMedDB, a database of computable knowledge mined from the biomedical literature. These methods search SemMedDB for confounders by applying semantic constraint search for indications treated by the drug (exposure) and that are also known to cause the adverse event (outcome). We then include the literature-derived confounder candidates in statistical and causal models derived from free-text clinical notes. For evaluation, we use a reference dataset widely used in drug safety containing labeled pairwise relationships between drugs and adverse events and attempt to rediscover these relationships from a corpus of 2.2 M NLP-processed free-text clinical notes. We employ standard adjustment and causal inference procedures to predict and estimate causal effects by informing the models with varying numbers of literature-derived confounders and instantiating the exposure, outcome, and confounder variables in the models with dichotomous EHR-derived data. Finally, we compare the results from applying these procedures with naive measures of association (chi 2 and reporting odds ratio) and with each other. Results and Conclusions: We found semantic vector-based search to be superior to string-based search at reducing confounding bias. However, the effect of including more rather than fewer literature-derived confounders was inconclusive. We recommend using targeted learning estimation methods that can address treatment-confounder feedback, where confounders also behave as intermediate variables, and engaging subject-matter experts to adjudicate the handling of problematic covariates.

However, most estimation methods rely on the strong assumption that all confounders are observed, which is impractical and untestable in the real world. We develop a mediation analysis framework inferring the latent confounder for debiasing both direct and indirect causal effects. Specifically, we introduce generalized structural equation modeling that incorporates structured latent factors to improve the goodness-of-fit of the model to observed data, and deconfound the mediators and outcome simultaneously. One major advantage of the proposed framework is that it uses the causal pathway structure from cause to outcome via multiple mediators to debias the causal effect without requiring external information on latent confounders. In addition, the proposed framework is flexible in terms of integrating powerful nonparametric prediction algorithms while retaining interpretable mediation effects. In theory, we establish the identification of both causal and mediation effects based on the proposed deconfounding method. Numerical experiments on both simulation settings and a normative aging study indicate that the proposed approach reduces the estimation bias of both causal and mediation effects.

For instance, in causal fairness, the total effect of being a male employee (i.e., treatment) constitutes its direct effect on annual income (i.e., outcome) and the indirect effect via the employee's occupation (i.e., mediator). Causal mediation analysis (CMA) is a formal statistical framework commonly used to reveal such underlying causal mechanisms. One major challenge of CMA in observational studies is handling confounders, variables that cause spurious causal relationships among treatment, mediator, and outcome. Conventional methods assume sequential ignorability that implies all confounders can be measured, which is often unverifiable in practice. This work aims to circumvent the stringent sequential ignorability assumptions and consider hidden confounders. Drawing upon proxy strategies and recent advances in deep learning, we propose to simultaneously uncover the latent variables that characterize hidden confounders and estimate the causal effects. Empirical evaluations using both synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We further show the potentials of our approach for causal fairness analysis.

Simultaneous adjustment of uncontrolled confounding, selection bias and misclassification in multiple-bias modelling	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Multi-bias modelling; confounding; information bias; selection bias; parameters; imputed; regression weight; mis-specification; simulation	REAL-WORLD EVIDENCE; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; CAUSAL DIAGRAMS; FORMULAS	Background Adjusting for multiple biases usually involves adjusting for one bias at a time, with careful attention to the order in which these biases are adjusted. A novel, alternative approach to multiple-bias adjustment involves the simultaneous adjustment of all biases via imputation and/or regression weighting. The imputed value or weight corresponds to the probability of the missing data and serves to 'reconstruct' the unbiased data that would be observed based on the provided assumptions of the degree of bias. Methods We motivate and describe the steps necessary to implement this method. We also demonstrate the validity of this method through a simulation study with an exposure-outcome relationship that is biased by uncontrolled confounding, exposure misclassification, and selection bias. Results The study revealed that a non-biased effect estimate can be obtained when correct bias parameters are applied. It also found that incorrect specification of every bias parameter by +/-25% still produced an effect estimate with less bias than the observed, biased effect. Conclusions Simultaneous multi-bias analysis is a useful way of investigating and understanding how multiple sources of bias may affect naive effect estimates. This new method can be used to enhance the validity and transparency of real-world evidence obtained from observational, longitudinal studies.

It is recommended in epidemiologic textbooks and articles over significance test of coefficients, but concerns have been raised concerning its validity. Few simulation studies have been conducted to investigate its performance. Methods An extensive simulation study was realized to compare different implementations of the change in estimate method. The implementations were also compared when estimating the association of body mass index with diastolic blood pressure in the PROspective Quebec Study on Work and Health. Results All methods were susceptible to introduce important bias and to produce confidence intervals that included the true effect much less often than expected in at least some scenarios. Overall mixed results were obtained regarding the accuracy of estimators, as measured by the mean squared error. No implementation adequately differentiated confounders from non-confounders. In the real data analysis, none of the implementation decreased the estimated standard error. Conclusion Based on these results, it is questionable whether change in estimate methods are beneficial in general, considering their low ability to improve the precision of estimates without introducing bias and inability to yield valid confidence intervals or to identify true confounders.

Causal Calculus in the Presence of Cycles, Latent Confounders and Selection Bias	35TH UNCERTAINTY IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE CONFERENCE (UAI 2019)	Proceedings of Machine Learning Research		English	Proceedings Paper	35th Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI) Conference	JUL 22-25, 2019	Tel Aviv, ISRAEL	Final, Playtika, Baidu, Bosch, GE, Googke, Intel, Microsoft, Oracle, Artificial Intelligence, Tel Aviv Univ, K Health			CONDITIONAL-INDEPENDENCE	We prove the main rules of causal calculus (also called do-calculus) for i/o structural causal models (ioSCMs), a generalization of a recently proposed general class of non-/linear structural causal models that allow for cycles, latent confounders and arbitrary probability distributions. We also generalize adjustment criteria and formulas from the acyclic setting to the general one (i.e. ioSCMs). Such criteria then allow to estimate (conditional) causal effects from observational data that was (partially) gathered under selection bias and cycles. This generalizes the backdoor criterion, the selection-backdoor criterion and extensions of these to arbitrary ioSCMs. Together, our results thus enable causal reasoning in the presence of cycles, latent confounders and selection bias. Finally, we extend the ID algorithm for the identification of causal effects to ioSCMs.	[Forre, Patrick; Mooij, Joris M.] Univ Amsterdam, Informat Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands	University of Amsterdam	Forré, P (corresponding author), Univ Amsterdam, Informat Inst, Amsterdam, Netherlands.	p.d.forre@uva.nl; j.m.mooij@uva.nl			European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union [639466]; European Research Council (ERC) [639466] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC)	European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)Spanish Government)	This work was supported by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement 639466).		38	3	4	1	2	JMLR-JOURNAL MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH	SAN DIEGO	1269 LAW ST, SAN DIEGO, CA, UNITED STATES	2640-3498			PR MACH LEARN RES			2020	115						71	80						10	Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Theory & Methods; Mathematics, Applied; Statistics & Probability	Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S)	Computer Science; Mathematics	BS4ST					2024-05-09	WOS:000722423500006

We propose a new approach to variational estimation of causal inference based on a representer theorem with a random input space. We estimate causal effects involving latent confounders that may be interdependent and time-varying from sequential, repeated measurements in an observational study. Our approach extends current work that assumes independent, non-temporal latent confounders with potentially biased estimators. We introduce a simple yet elegant algorithm without parametric specification on model components. Our method avoids the need for expensive and careful parameterization in deploying complex models, such as deep neural networks in existing approaches, for causal inference and analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various benchmark temporal datasets.

Shimizu et al. (2006) showed that acyclic, linear, non-Gaussian (LiNGAM) causal models are identified from observational data, so long as no latent confounders are present. That holds even when faithfulness fails. Genin and Mayo-Wilson (2020) refine that result: not only are causal relationships identified, but causal orientation is statistically decidable. That means that for every epsilon > 0, there is a method that converges in probability to the correct orientation and, at every sample size, outputs an incorrect orientation with probability less than epsilon. These results naturally raise questions about what happens in the presence of latent confounders. Hoyer et al. (2008) and Salehkaleybar et al. (2020) show that, although the causal model is not uniquely identified, causal orientation among observed variables is identified in the presence of latent confounders, so long as faithfulness is satisfied. This paper refines these results: although it is possible to converge to the right orientation in the limit, causal orientation is no longer statistically decidable-it is not possible to converge to the correct orientation with finite-sample bounds on the probability of orientation errors, even if faithfulness is satisfied. However, that limiting result suggests several adjustments to the LiNGAM model that may recover decidability.

We assume the data arise from a linear structural equation model (SEM) in which the idiosyncratic errors are allowed to be dependent in order to capture possible latent confounding. Each SEM can be represented by a graph where vertices represent observed variables, directed edges represent direct causal effects, and bidirected edges represent dependence among error terms. Specifically, we assume that the true model corresponds to a bow-free acyclic path diagram; i.e., a graph that has at most one edge between any pair of nodes and is acyclic in the directed part. We show that when the errors are non-Gaussian, the exact causal structure encoded by such a graph, and not merely an equivalence class, can be recovered from observational data. The method we propose for this purpose uses estimates of suitable moments, but, in contrast to previous results, does not require specifying the number of latent variables a priori. We also characterize the output of our procedure when the assumptions are violated and the true graph is acyclic, but not bow-free. We illustrate the effectiveness of our procedure in simulations and an application to an ecology data set.	[Wang, Y.

This study aimed to explain (dis)advantages of these techniques in estimating the effect of breast-conserving therapy (BCT) and mastectomy on 10-year distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS).MethodsAll women diagnosed in 2005 with primary T1-2N0-1 breast cancer treated with BCT or mastectomy were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. We used multivariable Cox regression to correct for confounding. Propensity trimming was used to create a more homogeneous population for which the treatment choice was not self-evident. Hospital of surgery was used as hierarchical level to handle hospital-related variation, and as IV to deal with unmeasured confounding.ResultsMultivariable Cox regression showed higher 10-year DMFS for BCT than mastectomy [HR 0.70 (95% CI 0.60-82)]. Propensity trimming on the 10-90th and the 20-80th percentile of the propensity score distribution and hierarchical modelling showed similar HRs. IV analysis showed no significant difference between BCT and mastectomy.ConclusionUnmeasured confounding is very difficult to eliminate in observational research. We cannot conclude that BCT or mastectomy has a causal relationship with 10-year DMFS. It is crucial to critically evaluate all model's assumptions, and to be careful in drawing firm conclusions.

J	Papadogeorgou, G; Dominici, F				Papadogeorgou, Georgia; Dominici, Francesca			A CAUSAL EXPOSURE RESPONSE FUNCTION WITH LOCAL ADJUSTMENT FOR CONFOUNDING: ESTIMATING HEALTH EFFECTS OF EXPOSURE TO LOW LEVELS OF AMBIENT FINE PARTICULATE MATTER	ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Air pollution; cardiovascular hospitalizations; causal inference; exposure response function; local confounding; low-exposure levels; particulate matter	AIR-POLLUTION EXPOSURE; CANADIAN CENSUS HEALTH; TERM PM2.5 EXPOSURE; MORTALITY; ASSOCIATION; SELECTION; CURVE; RISK; POPULATION; COHORT	In the last two decades ambient levels of air pollution have declined substantially. At the same time the Clean Air Act mandates that the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) must be routinely assessed to protect populations based on the latest science. Therefore, researchers should continue to address the following question: is exposure to levels of air pollution below the NAAQS harmful to human health? Furthermore, the contentious nature surrounding environmental regulations urges us to cast this question within a causal inference framework. Several parametric and semiparametric regression approaches have been used to estimate the exposure-response (ER) curve between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution concentrations and health outcomes. However, most of the existing approaches are not formulated within a formal framework for causal inference, adjust for the same set of potential confounders across all levels of exposure and do not account for model uncertainty regarding covariate selection and the shape of the ER. In this paper we introduce a Bayesian framework for the estimation of a causal ER curve called LERCA (Local Exposure Response Confounding Adjustment), which: (a) allows for different confounders and different strength of confounding at the different exposure levels, and (b) propagates model uncertainty regarding confounders' selection and the shape of the ER. Importantly, LERCA provides a principled way of assessing the observed covariates' confounding importance at different exposure levels, providing researchers with important information regarding the set of variables to measure and adjust for in regression models. Using simulation studies, we show that state-of-the-art approaches perform poorly in estimating the ER curve in the presence of local confounding. LERCA is used to evaluate the relationship between long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5, a key regulated pollutant, and cardiovascular hospitalizations for 5,362 zip codes in the continental U.S. and located near a pollution monitoring site, while adjusting for a potentially varying set of confounders across the exposure range. Our data set includes rich health, weather, demographic and pollution information for the years of 2011-2013. The estimated exposure-response curve is increasingly indicating that higher ambient concentrations lead to higher cardiovascular hospitalization rates, and ambient PM2.5 was estimated to lead to an increase in cardiovascular hospitalization rates when focusing at the low-exposure range. Our results indicate that there is no threshold for the effect of PM2.5 on cardiovascular hospitalizations.

Confounding in Statistical Mediation Analysis: What It Is and How to Address It	JOURNAL OF COUNSELING PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						mediation; causal inference; confounder adjustment	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; PREVENTION PROGRAM; CAUSAL INFERENCE; BIAS FORMULAS; SELF-EFFICACY; IDENTIFICATION; INTERVENTION; CHILDREN; DESIGN	Psychology researchers are often interested in mechanisms underlying how randomized interventions affect outcomes such as substance use and mental health. Mediation analysis is a common statistical method for investigating psychological mechanisms that has benefited from exciting new methodological improvements over the last 2 decades. One of the most important new developments is methodology for estimating causal mediated effects using the potential outcomes framework for causal inference. Potential outcomes-based methods developed in epidemiology and statistics have important implications for understanding psychological mechanisms. We aim to provide a concise introduction to and illustration of these new methods and emphasize the importance of confounder adjustment. First, we review the traditional regression approach for estimating mediated effects. Second, we describe the potential outcomes framework. Third, we define what a confounder is and how the presence of a confounder can provide misleading evidence regarding mechanisms of interventions. Fourth, we describe experimental designs that can help rule out confounder bias. Fifth, we describe new statistical approaches to adjust for measured confounders of the mediator-outcome relation and sensitivity analyses to probe effects of unmeasured confounders on the mediated effect. All approaches are illustrated with application to a real counseling intervention dataset. Counseling psychologists interested in understanding the causal mechanisms of their interventions can benefit from incorporating the most up-to-date techniques into their mediation analyses.

Estimation of Causal Effect Measures in the Presence of Measurement Error in Confounders	STATISTICS IN BIOSCIENCES			English	Article						Causal effect measures; Causal inference; Comparative effectiveness; Confounding; Measurement error	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; PROPENSITY SCORE; BIAS; MISCLASSIFICATION; SENSITIVITY; REGRESSION; INFERENCE; VARIABLES	The odds ratio, risk ratio, and the risk difference are important measures for assessing comparative effectiveness of available treatment plans in epidemiological studies. Estimation of these measures, however, is often challenged by the presence of error-contaminated confounders. In this article, by adapting two correction methods for measurement error effects applicable to the noncausal context, we propose valid methods which consistently estimate the causal odds ratio, causal risk ratio, and the causal risk difference for settings with error-prone confounders. Furthermore, we develop a bootstrap-based procedure to construct estimatorswith improved asymptotic efficiency. Numerical studies are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed methods.

J	Bagmar, MSH; Shen, H				Bagmar, Md Shaddam Hossain; Shen, Hua			Causal inference with missingness in confounder	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION			English	Article						Causal inference; confounders; missing at random; double robustness; EM algorithm; estimation efficiency	DOUBLY ROBUST ESTIMATION; MULTIPLE IMPUTATION; PROPENSITY SCORE	Causal inference is a process of uncovering causal relationship between effect variable and disease outcome in epidemiologic research. When estimating causal effect in observational studies, confounders that influence both the effect variable and the outcome need to be adjusted for in the estimation process. In addition, missing data often arise in data collection procedure; working with complete cases often results in biased parameter estimates. We consider the causal effect estimation in the presence of missingness in the confounders under the missing at random assumption. We investigate how the double robust estimators perform when applying complete-case analysis or multiple imputations. Given the uncertainty of appropriate imputation model and computational challenge for many imputations, we propose an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the expected values of the missing confounder and utilize a weighting approach in the estimation of the average treatment effect. Simulation studies are conducted to see whether there is any gain in estimation efficiency using the proposed method, instead of the complete case analysis and multiple imputations. The results identified EM as the most efficient and accurate method for dealing with missingness in confounder. Our study result is applied in a B-aware trial, which is a multi-centre clinical trial, to estimate the effect of total intravenous anaesthetic on post-operative anxiety.

J	Díaz, I				Diaz, Ivan			Non-agency interventions for causal mediation in the presence of intermediate confounding	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						causal inference; intermediate confounding; interventional causality; mediation analysis	INFERENCE; SEX; IDENTIFICATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; COEFFICIENTS; RACE	Recent approaches to causal inference have focused on causal effects defined as contrasts between the distribution of counterfactual outcomes under hypothetical interventions on the nodes of a graphical model. In this article, we develop theory for causal effects defined with respect to a different type of intervention, one which alters the information propagated through the edges of the graph. These information transfer interventions may be more useful than node interventions in settings in which causes are non-manipulable, for example when considering race or genetics as a causes. Furthermore, information transfer interventions allow us to define path-specific decompositions which are identified in the presence of treatment-induced mediator-outcome confounding, a practical problem whose general solution remains elusive. We prove that the proposed effects provide valid statistical tests of mechanisms, unlike popular methods based on randomised interventions on the mediator. We propose efficient non-parametric estimators for a covariance version of the proposed effects, using data-adaptive regression coupled with semi-parametric efficiency theory to address model misspecification bias while retaining n-consistency and asymptotic normality. We illustrate the use of our methods in two examples using publicly available data.

GrIVET consists of an order-based causal discovery method and a likelihood-based inferential procedure. For causal discovery, we generalize the existing peeling algorithm to estimate the ancestral relations and candidate instruments in the presence of hidden confounders. Based on this, we propose a new procedure for instrumental variable estimation of each direct effect by separating it from any mediation effects. For inference, we develop a new likelihood ratio test of multiple causal effects that is able to account for the unmeasured confounders. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed method has desirable guarantees, including robustness to invalid instruments and uncertain interventions, estimation consistency, low-order polynomial time complexity, and validity of asymptotic inference. Numerically, GrIVET performs well and compares favorably against state-of-the-art competitors. Furthermore, we demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of the proposed method through an application inferring regulatory pathways from Alzheimer's disease gene expression data.

It identified uncontrolled confounding, measurement error and other potential causal factors as common weaknesses. This paper supports those findings with evidence of uncontrolled confounding by parental education, intelligence or household management from several papers. It suggests that inappropriate statistical tests and aggregation of data representing different exposure routes partly explain why confounding has been overlooked. Inadequate correction of confounding has contributed to incorrect conclusions regarding causality at low levels of lead. Linear or log-linear regression models have tended to mask any threshold. While the effects of higher levels of lead exposure are not disputed, overestimation of health effects at low lead exposures has significant implications for policy-makers endeavouring to protect public health through cost-effective regulations.

Causal modelling of heavy-tailed variables and confounders with application to river flow	EXTREMES			English	Article						Causation; Causal tail coefficient; Confounder; Extreme value statistics; Generalized Pareto distribution		Confounding variables are a recurrent challenge for causal discovery and inference. In many situations, complex causal mechanisms only manifest themselves in extreme events, or take simpler forms in the extremes. Stimulated by data on extreme river flows and precipitation, we introduce a new causal discovery methodology for heavy-tailed variables that allows the effect of a known potential confounder to be almost entirely removed when the variables have comparable tails, and also decreases it sufficiently to enable correct causal inference when the confounder has a heavier tail. We also introduce a new parametric estimator for the existing causal tail coefficient and a permutation test. Simulations show that the methods work well and the ideas are applied to the motivating dataset.

Appropriate adjustment for confounding in such studies is challenging because exposure is determined by a complex interaction of patient, physician, and healthcare system factors. The challenges of confounding control are particularly acute in studies using healthcare utilization databases where information on many potential confounding factors is lacking and the meaning of variables is often unclear. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of different approaches to confounder control in healthcare databases. In settings where considerable uncertainty surrounds the data or the causal mechanisms underlying the treatment assignment and outcome process, we suggest that researchers report a panel of results under various specifications of statistical models. Such reporting allows the reader to assess the sensitivity of the results to model assumptions that are often not supported by strong subject-matter knowledge.	[Brookhart, M.

The first school is linked to path analysis and structural equation models (SEMs), while the second is related mostly to methods developed within the potential outcomes approach to causal inference. By giving model-free definitions of direct and indirect effects and clear assumptions for their identification, the latter school has formalized notions intuitively developed in the former and has greatly increased the flexibility of the models involved. However, through its predominant focus on nonparametric identification, the causal inference approach to effect decomposition via natural effects is limited to settings that exclude intermediate confounders. Such confounders are naturally dealt with (albeit with the caveats of informality and modeling inflexibility) in the SEM framework. Therefore, it seems pertinent to revisit SEMs with intermediate confounders, armed with the formal definitions and (parametric) identification assumptions from causal inference. Here we investigate: 1) how identification assumptions affect the specification of SEMs, 2) whether the more restrictive SEM assumptions can be relaxed, and 3) whether existing sensitivity analyses can be extended to this setting. Data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (1990-2005) are used for illustration.

Inverse-probability-of-treatment weighted estimation of causal parameters in the presence of error-contaminated and time-dependent confounders	BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						causal inference; inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting; logistic regression model; marginal structural model; measurement error; time-dependent confounding	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; SIMULATION-EXTRAPOLATION; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; MULTIPLE-IMPUTATION; PROPENSITY SCORE; REGRESSION; BIAS; INFERENCE; MISCLASSIFICATION	Inverse-probability-of-treatment weighted (IPTW) estimation has been widely used to consistently estimate the causal parameters in marginal structural models, with time-dependent confounding effects adjusted for. Just like other causal inference methods, the validity of IPTW estimation typically requires the crucial condition that all variables are precisely measured. However, this condition, is often violated in practice due to various reasons. It has been well documented that ignoring measurement error often leads to biased inference results. In this paper, we consider the IPTW estimation of the causal parameters in marginal structural models in the presence of error-contaminated and time-dependent confounders. We explore several methods to correct for the effects of measurement error on the estimation of causal parameters. Numerical studies are reported to assess the finite sample performance of the proposed methods.

A Proxy Variable View of Shared Confounding	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING, VOL 139	Proceedings of Machine Learning Research		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)	JUL 18-24, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK				BLESSINGS; IDENTIFICATION	Causal inference from observational data can be biased by unobserved confounders. Confounders-the variables that affect both the treatments and the outcome-induce spurious non-causal correlations between the two. Without additional conditions, unobserved confounders generally make causal quantities hard to identify. In this paper, we focus on the setting where there are many treatments with shared confounding, and we study under what conditions is causal identification possible. The key observation is that we can view subsets of treatments as proxies of the unobserved confounder and identify the intervention distributions of the rest. Moreover, while existing identification formulas for proxy variables involve solving integral equations, we show that one can circumvent the need for such solutions by directly modeling the data. Finally, we extend these results to an expanded class of causal graphs, those with other confounders and selection variables.

J	Tong, SL; Lu, Y				Tong, SL; Lu, Y			Identification of confounders in the assessment of the relationship between lead exposure and child development	ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						bias (epidemiology); confounding factors (epidemiology); selection criteria; epidemiologic research	PORT-PIRIE; NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE; AGE; INTELLIGENCE; COHORT	PURPOSE: To explore the best approach to identify and adjust for confounders in epidemiologic practice METHODS: In the Port Pirie cohort study, the selection of covariates was based on both a priori and an empirical consideration. In an assessment of the relationship between exposure to environmental lead and child development, change-in estimate (CE) and significance testing (ST) criteria were compared in identifying potential confounders. The Pearson correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the potential for collinearity between pairs of major quantitative covariates. In multivariate analyses, the effects of confounding factors were assessed with multiple linear regression models. RESULTS: The nature and number of covariates selected varied with different confounder selection criteria and different cutoffs. Four covariates (i.e., quality of home environment, socioeconomic status (SES), maternal intelligence, and parental smoking behaviour) met the conventional CE criterion (greater than or equal to 10%), whereas 14 variables met the ST criterion (p less than or equal to 0.25). However, the magnitude of the relationship between blood lead concentration and children's IQ differed slightly after adjustment fur confounding, using either the CE (partial regression coefficient: -4.4; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.5 to -8.3) or ST criterion (-4.3; 95% CI: -0.2 to -8.4). CONCLUSIONS: Identification and selection of confounding factors need to be viewed cautiously in epidemiologic studies. Either the CE (e.g., greater than or equal to 10%) or ST (e.g., P less than or equal to 0.25) criterion may be implemented in identification of a potential confounder if a study sample is sufficiently large, and both the methods are subject to arbitrariness of selecting a cut-off point. In this study, the CE criterion (i.e., greater than or equal to 10%) appears to be more stringent than the ST method (i.e., P less than or equal to 0.25) in the identification of confounders. However, the ST rule cannot be used to determine the trueness of confounding because it cannot reflect the causal relationship between the confounder and outcome. This study shows the complexities one can expect to encounter in the identification of and adjustment for confounders. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.

A common practice to address MNAR is to treat missing entries from the so-called "exposure" perspective, i.e., modeling how an item is exposed (provided) to a user. Most of the existing approaches use heuristic models or re-weighting strategy on observed ratings to mimic the missing-at-random setting. However, little research has been done to reveal how the ratings are missing from a causal perspective. To bridge the gap, we propose an unbiased and robust method called DENC (De-Bias Network Confounding in Recommendation), inspired by confounder analysis in causal inference. In general, DENC provides a causal analysis on MNAR from both the inherent factors (e.g., latent user or item factors) and auxiliary network's perspective. Particularly, the proposed exposure model in DENC can control the social network confounder meanwhile preserve the observed exposure information. We also develop a deconfounding model through the balanced representation learning to retain the primary user and item features, which enables DENC generalize well on the rating prediction. Extensive experiments on three datasets validate that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.

Multiply robust causal inference with double-negative control adjustment for categorical unmeasured confounding	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Causal inference; Negative control; Semiparametric inference; Unmeasured confounding	CONTROL EXPOSURES; TIME-SERIES; BIAS	Unmeasured confounding is a threat to causal inference in observational studies. In recent years, the use of negative controls to mitigate unmeasured confounding has gained increasing recognition and popularity. Negative controls have a long-standing tradition in laboratory sciences and epidemiology to rule out non-causal explanations, although they have been used primarily for bias detection. Recently, Miao and colleagues have described sufficient conditions under which a pair of negative control exposure and outcome variables can be used to identify non-parametrically the average treatment effect (ATE) from observational data subject to uncontrolled confounding. We establish non-parametric identification of the ATE under weaker conditions in the case of categorical unmeasured confounding and negative control variables. We also provide a general semiparametric framework for obtaining inferences about the ATE while leveraging information about a possibly large number of measured covariates. In particular, we derive the semiparametric efficiency bound in the non-parametric model, and we propose multiply robust and locally efficient estimators when non-parametric estimation may not be feasible. We assess the finite sample performance of our methods in extensive simulation studies. Finally, we illustrate our methods with an application to the post-licensure surveillance of vaccine safety among children.

However, almost all the machine learning methods for causal inference have been studied under the assumption of no unmeasured confounding and there is little work on handling omitted/unmeasured variable bias. This paper focuses on a machine learning method based on random forests known as Causal Forests and presents five simple modifications for tuning Causal Forests so that they are robust to cluster-level unmeasured confounding. Our simulation study finds that adjusting the default tuning procedure with the propensity score from fixed effects logistic regression or using variables that are centered to their cluster means produces estimates that are more robust to cluster-level unmeasured confounding. Also, when these parametric propensity score models are mis-specified, our modified machine learning methods remain robust to bias from cluster-level unmeasured confounders compared to existing parametric approaches based on propensity score weighting. We conclude by demonstrating our proposals in a real data study concerning the effect of taking an eighth-grade algebra course on math achievement scores from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study.

The methods are applied to the selection of covariates in a study of the effect of lead in the blood on children's ability and are evaluated by a simulation study on multivariate normal data.

There is, however, seldom clear subject-matter or empirical evidence for such an assumption. We therefore develop uncertainty intervals for average causal effects based on outcome regression estimators and doubly robust estimators, which provide inference taking into account both sampling variability and uncertainty due to unobserved confounders. In contrast with sampling variation, uncertainty due to unobserved confounding does not decrease with increasing sample size. The intervals introduced are obtained by modeling the treatment assignment mechanism and its correlation with the outcome given the observed confounders, allowing us to derive the bias of the estimators due to unobserved confounders. We are thus also able to contrast the size of the bias due to violation of the unconfoundedness assumption, with bias due to misspecification of the models used to explain potential outcomes. This is illustrated through numerical experiments where bias due to moderate unobserved confounding dominates misspecification bias for typical situations in terms of sample size and modeling assumptions. We also study the empirical coverage of the uncertainty intervals introduced and apply the results to a study of the effect of regular food intake on health. An R-package implementing the inference proposed is available.

Miettinen and Cook (1981) derived two criteria for detecting confounders. Using a model, Wickramaratne and Holford (1987) proved that the two criteria are necessary but not sufficient conditions for confounders. We take uniform nonconfounding to mean there is no confounding at a coarse-subpopulation-level obtained by pooling any number of subpopulations. We discuss the necessity and sufficiency of the two criteria for uniform nonconfounding. The concepts of homogeneity and collapsibility for causal effects are also defined, and the relation among confounding, homogeneity and collapsibility is discussed. We show that the common causal effect over all fine subpopulations is just the causal effect of the whole population.

Mediation, confounding, and colliding are three key third-variable effects that yield different theoretical and methodological implications for drawing causal conclusions. Commonly used covariance-based statistical methods, such as linear regression and structural equation modeling, cannot distinguish these effects in practice, however. In this study, we introduce a statistical approach for distinguishing mediators, confounders, colliders, and potential M-bias structures that uses higher-order moment information from the data. We propose a two-step procedure that uses the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion within the direction dependence analysis framework. Results from Monte Carlo simulations show that our proposed approach accurately recovers the true data-generating process of the third variable. We provide an empirical example to demonstrate the application of our proposed approach in psychological research. Finally, we discuss implications and future directions of our work.

J	Liu, YJ; Sun, J; Sun, HY; Chang, Y				Liu, Yijun; Sun, Ji; Sun, Huiyan; Chang, Yi			Identification of key somatic oncogenic mutation based on a confounder-free causal inference model	PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY			English	Article							OXIDATIVE STRESS; CELL-CYCLE; CANCER; P53; SELECTION	Abnormal cell proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are the essential events that induce cancer initiation and progression. A fundamental goal in cancer research is to develop an efficient method to detect mutational genes capable of driving cancer. Although several computational methods have been proposed to identify these key mutations, many of them focus on the association between genetic mutations and functional changes in relevant biological processes, but not their real causality. Causal effect inference provides a way to estimate the real induce effect of a certain mutation on vital biological processes of cancer initiation and progression, through addressing the confounder bias due to neutral mutations and unobserved latent variables. In this study, integrating genomic and transcriptomic data, we construct a novel causal inference model based on a deep variational autoencoder to identify key oncogenic somatic mutations. Applied to 10 cancer types, our method quantifies the causal effect of genetic mutations on cell proliferation and EMT by reducing both observed and unobserved confounding biases. The experimental results indicate that genes with higher mutation frequency do not necessarily mean they are more potent in inducing cancer and promoting cancer development. Moreover, our study fills a gap in the use of machine learning for causal inference to identify oncogenic mutations.

Unifying instrumental variable and inverse probability weighting approaches for inference of causal treatment effect and unmeasured confounding in observational studies	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Causal treatment effect; identification bounds; instrumental variable; inverse probability weighting; unmeasured confounding	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; PRINCIPAL STRATIFICATION; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; PROPENSITY SCORE; BOUNDS; IDENTIFICATION; REGRESSION; DESIGN; TRIALS; COHORT	Confounding is a major concern when using data from observational studies to infer the causal effect of a treatment. Instrumental variables, when available, have been used to construct bound estimates on population average treatment effects when outcomes are binary and unmeasured confounding exists. With continuous outcomes, meaningful bounds are more challenging to obtain because the domain of the outcome is unrestricted. In this paper, we propose to unify the instrumental variable and inverse probability weighting methods, together with suitable assumptions in the context of an observational study, to construct meaningful bounds on causal treatment effects. The contextual assumptions are imposed in terms of the potential outcomes that are partially identified by data. The inverse probability weighting component incorporates a sensitivity parameter to encode the effect of unmeasured confounding. The instrumental variable and inverse probability weighting methods are unified using the principal stratification. By solving the resulting system of estimating equations, we are able to quantify both the causal treatment effect and the sensitivity parameter (i.e. the degree of the unmeasured confounding). We demonstrate our method by analyzing data from the HIV Epidemiology Research Study.

Double Bias: Estimation of Causal Effects from Length-Biased Samples in the Presence of Confounding	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOSTATISTICS			English	Article						Causal Inference; Length-biased Sampling; Propensity Score; Cox Proportional Hazard model; Accelerated Failure Time model	PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS REGRESSION; NONPARAMETRIC-ESTIMATION; PREVALENT COHORT; PROPENSITY SCORE; SURVIVAL CURVES; LIKELIHOOD; MODELS; STATIONARITY; STATISTICS	Length bias in survival data occurs in observational studies when, for example, subjects with shorter lifetimes are less likely to be present in the recorded data. In this paper, we consider estimating the causal exposure (treatment) effect on survival time from observational data when, in addition to the lack of randomization and consequent potential for confounding, the data constitute a length-biased sample; we hence term this a double-bias problem. We develop estimating equations that can be used to estimate the causal effect indexing the structural Cox proportional hazard and accelerated failure time models for point exposures in double-bias settings. The approaches rely on propensity score-based adjustments, and we demonstrate that estimation of the propensity score must be adjusted to acknowledge the length-biased sampling. Large sample properties of the estimators are established and their small sample behavior is studied using simulations. We apply the proposed methods to a set of, partly synthesized, length-biased survival data collected as part of the Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA) to compare survival of subjects with dementia among institutionalized patients versus those recruited from the community and depict their adjusted survival curves.

These range from ultrasensitive molecular switches in signaling pathways, to assembly and activation of inflammasomes, to rupture of lysosomes and pyroptosis of cells. Realistic dose-response modeling and risk analysis must confront the reality of nonlinear C-R functions. This paper reviews several challenges for traditional statistical regression modeling of C-R functions with thresholds and nonlinearities, together with methods for overcoming them. Statistically significantly positive exposure-response regression coefficients can arise from many non-causal sources such as model specification errors, incompletely controlled confounding, exposure estimation errors, attribution of interactions to factors, associations among explanatory variables, or coincident historical trends. If so, the unadjusted regression coefficients do not necessarily predict how or whether reducing exposure would reduce risk. We discuss statistical options for controlling for such threats, and advocate causal Bayesian networks and dynamic simulation models as potentially valuable complements to nonparametric regression modeling for assessing causally interpretable nonlinear C-R functions and understanding how time patterns of exposures affect risk. We conclude that these approaches are promising for extending the great advances made in statistical C-R modeling methods in recent decades to clarify how to design regulations that are more causally effective in protecting human health.

We focus on a high-dimensional linear regression setting, where the measured covariates are affected by hidden confounding and propose the doubly debiased lasso estimator for individual components of the regression coefficient vector. Our advocated method simultaneously corrects both the bias due to estimation of high-dimensional parameters as well as the bias caused by the hidden confounding. We establish its asymptotic normality and also prove that it is efficient in the Gauss-Markov sense. The validity of our methodology relies on a dense confounding assumption, that is, that every confounding variable affects many covariates. The finite sample performance is illustrated with an extensive simulation study and a genomic application. The method is implemented by the DDL package available from CRAN.

Confounding factors in determining causal soil moisture-precipitation feedback	WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH			English	Article							UNITED-STATES; GRANGER CAUSALITY; AFTERNOON PRECIPITATION; COUPLING STRENGTH; MODEL; MEMORY	Identification of causal links in the land-atmosphere system is important for construction and testing of land surface and general circulation models. However, the land and atmosphere are highly coupled and linked by a vast number of complex, interdependent processes. Statistical methods, such as Granger causality, can help to identify feedbacks from observational data, independent of the different parameterizations of physical processes and spatiotemporal resolution effects that influence feedbacks in models. However, statistical causal identification methods can easily be misapplied, leading to erroneous conclusions about feedback strength and sign. Here, we discuss three factors that must be accounted for in determination of causal soil moisture-precipitation feedback in observations and model output: seasonal and interannual variability, precipitation persistence, and endogeneity. The effect of neglecting these factors is demonstrated in simulated and observational data. The results show that long-timescale variability and precipitation persistence can have a substantial effect on detected soil moisture-precipitation feedback strength, while endogeneity has a smaller effect that is often masked by measurement error and thus is more likely to be an issue when analyzing model data or highly accurate observational data.

Intriguingly, a substantial behavioral literature suggests that naive human reasoners, adults and children, are tacitly sensitive to causal confounding. Here, a combination of fMRI and computational cognitive modeling was used to investigate neural substrates mediating such sensitivity. While being scanned, participants observed and judged the influences of various putative causes with confounded or nonconfounded, deterministic or stochastic, influences. During judgments requiring generalization of causal knowledge from a feedback-based learning context to a transfer probe, activity in the dorsomedial pFC was better accounted for by a Bayesian causal model, sensitive to both confounding and stochasticity, than a purely error-driven algorithm, sensitive only to stochasticity. Implications for the detection and estimation of distinct forms of uncertainty, and for a neural mediation of domain-general constraints on causal induction, are discussed.

A causal examination of the effects of confounding factors on multimetric indices	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS			English	Article						Multimetric index; Metric adjustment; Causal networks; Biological integrity; Bioassessment; Human disturbance; Environmental covariates	BIOTIC INTEGRITY; PERFORMANCE; SCALE	The development of multimetric indices (MMIs) as a means of providing integrative measures of ecosystem condition is becoming widespread. An increasingly recognized problem for the interpretability of MMIs is controlling for the potentially confounding influences of environmental covariates. Most common approaches to handling covariates are based on simple notions of statistical control, leaving the causal implications of covariates and their adjustment unstated. In this paper, we use graphical models to examine some of the potential impacts of environmental covariates on the observed signals between human disturbance and potential response metrics. Using simulations based on various causal networks, we show how environmental covariates can both obscure and exaggerate the effects of human disturbance on individual metrics. We then examine from a causal interpretation standpoint the common practice of adjusting ecological metrics for environmental influences using only the set of sites deemed to be in reference condition. We present and examine the performance of an alternative approach to metric adjustment that uses the whole set of sites and models both environmental and human disturbance effects simultaneously. The findings from our analyses indicate that failing to model and adjust metrics can result in a systematic bias towards those metrics in which environmental covariates function to artificially strengthen the metric-disturbance relationship resulting in MMIs that do not accurately measure impacts of human disturbance. We also find that a "whole-set modeling approach" requires fewer assumptions and is more efficient with the given information than the more commonly applied "reference-set" approach.

J	Brandt, H				Brandt, Holger			A More Efficient Causal Mediator Model Without the No-Unmeasured-Confounder Assumption	MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Mediator model; structural mean models; thin plate regression spline; generalized additive model; no-unmeasured-confounder; rank preserving model; no-effect-modifier	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; INFERENCE; DEFINITION; REGRESSION; TRIALS	Mediator models have been developed primarily under the assumption of no-unmeasured-confounding. In many situations, this assumption is violated and may lead to the identification of mediator variables that actually are statistical artifacts. The rank preserving model (RPM) is an alternative approach to estimate controlled direct and mediator effects. It is based on the structural mean models framework and a no-effect-modifier assumption. The RPM assumes that unobserved confounders do not interact with treatment or mediators. This assumption is often more plausible to hold than the no-unmeasured-confounder assumption. So far, models using the no-effect-modifier assumption have been rarely used, which might be due to its low power and inefficiency in many scenarios. Here, a semi-parametric nonlinear extension, the nRPM, is proposed that overcomes this inefficiency using thin plate regression splines that both increase the predictive power of the model and decrease the misspecification present in many situations. In a simulation study, it is shown that the nRPM provides estimates that are robust against the violation of the no-effect-modifier assumption and that are substantively more efficient than those of the RPM. The model is illustrated using a data set on CD4 cell counts in a context of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

J	Zhou, M; Yao, WX				Zhou, Mi; Yao, Weixin			Sensitivity analysis of unmeasured confounding in causal inference based on exponential tilting and super learner	JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Causal inference; unmeasured confounding; sensitivity analysis; super learner	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; SEMIPARAMETRIC REGRESSION; REPEATED OUTCOMES; PROPENSITY SCORE	Causal inference under the potential outcome framework relies on the strongly ignorable treatment assumption. This assumption is usually questionable in observational studies, and the unmeasured confounding is one of the fundamental challenges in causal inference. To this end, we propose a new sensitivity analysis method to evaluate the impact of the unmeasured confounder by leveraging ideas of doubly robust estimators, the exponential tilt method, and the super learner algorithm. Compared to other existing methods of sensitivity analysis that parameterize the unmeasured confounder as a latent variable in the working models, the exponential tilting method does not impose any restrictions on the structure or models of the unmeasured confounders. In addition, in order to reduce the modeling bias of traditional parametric methods, we propose incorporating the super learner machine learning algorithm to perform nonparametric model estimation and the corresponding sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, most existing sensitivity analysis methods require multivariate sensitivity parameters, which make its choice difficult and subjective in practice. In comparison, the new method has a univariate sensitivity parameter with a nice and simple interpretation of log-odds ratios for binary outcomes, which makes its choice and the application of the new sensitivity analysis method very easy for practitioners.

THE EFFECT OF UNMEASURED CONFOUNDERS ON THE ABILITY TO ESTIMATE A TRUE PERFORMANCE OR SELECTION GRADIENT (AND OTHER PARTIAL REGRESSION COEFFICIENTS)	EVOLUTION			English	Article						Effect size; Monte-Carlo; simulation; multiple regression; omitted variable bias; sensitivity analysis	SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION; SWIMMING PERFORMANCE; MULTIPLE-REGRESSION; EVOLUTION; CONSTRAINTS; ECOLOGY; FITNESS; MORPHOLOGY; SINGLE; MODEL	Multiple regression of observational data is frequently used to infer causal effects. Partial regression coefficients are biased estimates of causal effects if unmeasured confounders are not in the regression model. The sensitivity of partial regression coefficients to omitted confounders is investigated with a Monte-Carlo simulation. A subset of causal traits is "measured" and their effects are estimated using ordinary least squares regression and compared to their expected values. Three major results are: (1) the error due to confounding is much larger than that due to sampling, especially with large samples, (2) confounding error shrinks trivially with sample size, and (3) small true effects are frequently estimated as large effects. Consequently, confidence intervals from regression are poor guides to the true intervals, especially with large sample sizes. The addition of a confounder to the model improves estimates only 55% of the time. Results are improved with complete knowledge of the rank order of causal effects but even with this omniscience, measured intervals are poor proxies for true intervals if there are many unmeasured confounders. The results suggest that only under very limited conditions can we have much confidence in the magnitude of partial regression coefficients as estimates of causal effects.

Such studies can complement findings from randomized clinical trials by involving larger and more generalizable patient populations by accruing greater durations of follow-up and by representing what happens more typically in the clinical setting. However, the interpretation of exposure effects in observational studies is almost always complicated by non-random exposure allocation, which can result in confounding and potentially lead to misleading conclusions. Confounding occurs when an extraneous factor, related to both the exposure and the outcome of interest, partly or entirely explains the relationship observed between the study exposure and the outcome. Although randomization can eliminate confounding by distributing all such extraneous factors equally across the levels of a given exposure, methods for dealing with confounding in observational studies include a careful choice of study design and the possible use of advanced analytical methods. The aim of this paper is to introduce some of the approaches that can be used to help minimize the impact of confounding in observational research to the reader working in the pharmaceutical industry.

Causal effect estimation strategies in a longitudinal study with complex time-varying confounders: A tutorial	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						sciatica; causal; inverse probability weighting; propensity	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; ZIDOVUDINE; SURVIVAL; SCIATICA; SURGERY	The Dutch Sciatica Trial represents a longitudinal study with complex time-varying confounders as patients with poorer health conditions (e.g. more severe pain) are more likely to opt for surgery, which, in turn, may affect future outcomes (pain severity). A straightforward classical as-treated comparison at the end point would lead to biased estimation of the surgery effect. We present several strategies of causal treatment effect estimation that might be applicable for analyzing such data. These include an inverse probability of treatment weighted regression analysis, a marginal weighted analysis, an unweighted regression analysis, and several propensity score-based approaches. In addition, we demonstrate how to evaluate these approaches in a thorough simulation study where we generate various realistic complex confounding patterns akin to the sciatica study.

J	Mansournia, MA; Poole, C				Mansournia, Mohammad Ali; Poole, Charles			Case-control matching on confounders revisited	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Matching; Case-control study; Confounding; Selection bias	CAUSAL DIAGRAMS; DESIGN; COLLAPSIBILITY; VALIDITY; CONFIDENCE; EFFICIENCY; MODELS; RISK	Matching by a confounder in a case-control study nearly always produces a control-selection bias that mixes with the confounding to produce a net bias. Previous theoretical work has assumed that control for a single confounder, the matching factor, is sufficient to remove all the confounding and that the confounder-exposure, confounder-outcome and exposure-outcome associations are monotonic. Under these conditions: (a) The net bias is toward the null if the exposure affects the outcome and nil if it does not. (b) If the confounding is away from the null, the selection bias is toward the null. (c) If the confounding is toward the null, the selection bias can be in any direction or even nil. If more than one confounder needs to be controlled to remove all the confounding, the net bias from matching by one of them can be away from the null, whether the exposure affects the outcome or not. An influential heuristic, that matching controls to cases by a variable associated with exposure always brings the marginal exposure distributions of the case and control groups closer together, turns out to be faulty. The implications of matching by confounders in case-control studies are less straightforward than previously thought. Suggestions are offered for advancing the methodologic literature on this topic.

The approach need not use a complete Causal diagram as long as it is known that known covariate set Z contains the parent set of the exposure E. On the other a hand, whether a covariate is or not a confounder may depend on its categorization. We introduce uniform non-confounding which implies non-confounding in any subpopulation defined by the interval of a covariate (or any pooled level for a discrete covariate). We show that the conditions in Miettinen and Cook's criteria for non-confounding also imply uniform non-con founding. Further we present an algorithm for deleting non-confounders from the potential confounder set Z, which extends Greenland et al.'s [1999a. Causal diagrams for epidemiologic research. Epidemiology 10, 37-48] approach by splitting Z into a series of potential confounder subsets. We also discuss conditions for non-confounding bias in the subpopulations in which we are interested, where the subpopulations may be defined by non-con founders. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Causal inference in survival analysis under deterministic missingness of confounders in register data	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article; Early Access						causal inference; confounder; deterministic missingness; register data; survival analysis	PSEUDO-OBSERVATIONS; INVERSE PROBABILITY; IMPUTATION; REGRESSION; VALUES	Long-term register data offer unique opportunities to explore causal effects of treatments on time-to-event outcomes, in well-characterized populations with minimum loss of follow-up. However, the structure of the data may pose methodological challenges. Motivated by the Swedish Renal Registry and estimation of survival differences for renal replacement therapies, we focus on the particular case when an important confounder is not recorded in the early period of the register, so that the entry date to the register deterministically predicts confounder missingness. In addition, an evolving composition of the treatment arms populations, and suspected improved survival outcomes in later periods lead to informative administrative censoring, unless the entry date is appropriately accounted for. We investigate different consequences of these issues on causal effect estimation following multiple imputation of the missing covariate data. We analyse the performance of different combinations of imputation models and estimation methods for the population average survival. We further evaluate the sensitivity of our results to the nature of censoring and misspecification of fitted models. We find that an imputation model including the cumulative baseline hazard, event indicator, covariates and interactions between the cumulative baseline hazard and covariates, followed by regression standardization, leads to the best estimation results overall, in simulations. Standardization has two advantages over inverse probability of treatment weighting here: it can directly account for the informative censoring by including the entry date as a covariate in the outcome model, and allows for straightforward variance computation using readily available software.

But causal inference of longitudinal data in the presence of time-varying confounding is notoriously challenging. In this tutorial, we introduce g-estimation, a well-established estimation strategy from the causal inference literature. G-estimation is a powerful analytic tool designed to handle time-varying confounding variables affected by treatment. We offer step-by-step guidance on implementing the g-estimation method using standard parametric regression functions familiar to psychological researchers and commonly available in statistical software. To facilitate hands-on usage, we provide software code at each step using the open-source statistical software R. All the R code presented in this tutorial are publicly available online.

Recently, many articles have been published in the epidemiologic literature demonstrating the need for appropriate models to accommodate competing risks when they are present. However, there has been little attention to variable selection for confounder control in competing risk analyses. Methods: We employ simulation to demonstrate the bias in two variable selection strategies include covariates that are associated with the exposure and (1) which change the cause-specific hazard of any of the outcomes; or (2) which change the cause-specific hazard of the specific event of interest. Results: We demonstrated minimal to no bias in estimators adjusted for confounders of exposure and either the event of interest or the competing event, but bias of varying magnitude in almost all estimators adjusted only for confounders of exposure and the primary outcome. Discussion: When estimating causal effects for which there are competing risks, the analysis should control for confounders of both the exposure-primary outcome effect and of the exposure-competing outcome effect.

Controlling for time-dependent confounding using marginal structural models	STATA JOURNAL			English	Article						st0075; marginal structural models; causal models; weighted regression; survival analysis; logistic regression; confounding		Longitudinal studies in which exposures, confounders, and outcomes are measured repeatedly over time have the potential to allow causal inferences about the effects of exposure on outcome. There is particular interest in estimating the causal effects of medical treatments (or other interventions) in circumstances in which a randomized controlled trial is difficult or impossible. However, standard methods for estimating exposure effects in longitudinal studies are biased in the presence of time-dependent confounders affected by prior treatment. This article describes the use of marginal structural models (described by Robins, Hern'an, and Brumback [2000]) to estimate exposure or treatment effects in the presence of time-dependent confounders affected by prior treatment. The method is based on deriving inverse-probability-of-treatment weights, which are then used in a pooled logistic regression model to estimate the causal effect of treatment on outcome. We demonstrate the use of marginal structural models to estimate the effect of methotrexate on mortality in persons suffering from rheumatoid arthritis.

Yet, apart from confounding in experimental designs, the topic is given little or no discussion in most statistics texts. We here provide an overview of confounding and related concepts based on a counterfactual model for causation. Special attention is given to definitions of confounding, problems in control of confounding, the relation of confounding to exchangeability and collapsibility, and the importance of distinguishing confounding from noncollapsibility.

Standard regression adjustment for observed time-varying confounders is unsuitable, as it can eliminate part of the causal effect and induce bias. Inverse probability weighting, g-computation, and g-estimation have been proposed as being more suitable methods. G-estimation has some advantages over the other two methods, but until recently there has been a lack of flexible g-estimation methods for a survival time outcome. The recently proposed Structural Nested Cumulative Survival Time Model (SNCSTM) is such a method. Efficient estimation of the parameters of this model required bespoke software. In this article we show how the SNCSTM can be fitted efficiently via g-estimation using standard software for fitting generalised linear models. The ability to implement g-estimation for a survival outcome using standard statistical software greatly increases the potential uptake of this method. We illustrate the use of this method of fitting the SNCSTM by reanalyzing data from the UK Cystic Fibrosis Registry, and provide example R code to facilitate the use of this approach by other researchers.

We develop a loss minimization approach for estimating bounds on the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) when unobserved confounders have a bounded effect on the odds ratio of treatment selection. Our approach is scalable and allows flexible use of model classes in estimation, including nonparametric and black-box machine learning methods. Based on these bounds for the CATE, we propose a sensitivity analysis for the average treatment effect (ATE). Our semiparametric estimator extends/bounds the augmented inverse propensity weighted (AIPW) estimator for the ATE under bounded unobserved confounding. By constructing a Neyman orthogonal score, our estimator of the bound for the ATE is a regular root-n estimator so long as the nuisance parameters are estimated at the op(n(-1/4)) rate. We complement our methodology with optimality results showing that our proposed bounds are tight in certain cases. We demonstrate our method on simulated and real data examples, and show accurate coverage of our confidence intervals in practical finite sample regimes with rich covariate information.

Sensitivity Plots for Confounder Bias in the Single Mediator Model	EVALUATION REVIEW			English	Article						mediation; indirect effects; causal inference; confounder bias; sensitivity analysis	CAUSAL; IDENTIFICATION; INFERENCE	Background: Causal inference continues to be a critical aspect of evaluation research. Recent research in causal inference for statistical mediation has focused on addressing the sequential ignorability assumption; specifically, that there is no confounding between the mediator and the outcome variable. Objectives: This article compares and contrasts three different methods for assessing sensitivity to confounding and describes the graphical depiction of these methods. Design: Two types of data were used to fully examine the plots for sensitivity analysis. The first type was generated data from a single mediator model with a confounder influencing both the mediator and the outcome variable. The second was data from an actual intervention study. With both types of data, situations are examined where confounding has a large effect and a small effect. Subjects: The nonsimulated data were from a large intervention study to decrease intentions to use steroids among high school football players. We demonstrate one situation where confounding is likely and another situation where confounding is unlikely. Conclusions: We discuss how these methods could be implemented in future mediation studies as well as the limitations and future directions for these methods.

Developmental Trajectories in Diagnostic Reasoning: Understanding Data Are Confounded Develops Independently of Choosing Informative Interventions to Resolve Confounded Data	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						diagnostic reasoning; scientific thinking; control of variables strategy (CVS); causal reasoning; experimentation; preschoolers	LONGITUDINAL DATA; YOUNG-CHILDREN; CAUSAL; HYPOTHESIS; EXPLANATION; INFERENCES; STRATEGIES; KNOWLEDGE; BLICKETS; BELIEFS	Two facets of diagnostic reasoning related to scientific thinking are recognizing the difference between confounded and unconfounded evidence and selecting appropriate interventions that could provide learners the evidence necessary to make an appropriate causal conclusion (i.e., the control-of-variables strategy). The present study investigates both these abilities in 3- to 6-year-old children (N = 57). We found both competence and developmental progress in the capacity to recognize that evidence is confounded. Similarly, children performed above chance in some tasks testing for the selection of a controlled test of a hypothesis. However, these capacities were unrelated, suggesting that preschoolers' nascent understanding of the control-of-variables strategy may not be driven by a metacognitive understanding that confounded evidence does not support a unique causal conclusion, and requires further investigation.

Although this approach controls for time-invariant confounders by design, it may allow for selection bias and confounding by time-varying factors. We conducted a simulation study of the sensitivity of the symmetric bidirectional case-crossover design to time-varying patterns in exposure and outcome. We identified the effects of selection bias and confounding on symmetric bidirectional case-cross, over results and offer strategies to eliminate or reduce these biases. Selection bias results when exposure in the reference periods is not identically representative of exposure in the hazard periods, even when the distribution of exposure is stationary. This bias can be estimated and removed. Selection bias also occurs when the distribution of exposure is nonstationary, but the adjusted symmetric bidirectional case-crossover methodology substantially controls for this. Confounding results from a common temporal pattern in the exposure and the outcome time series, but can also be the result of patterns in exposure and outcome that, although asymptotically uncorrelated, are correlated at finite series lengths. All three biases are reduced by choosing shorter referent-spacing lengths. This effect is illustrated using data on air pollution and daily deaths in Chicago.

For a time-to-event response, marginal structural Cox models are frequently used to deal with such confounding. To avoid some of the problems of fitting marginal structural Cox model, the sequential Cox approach has been suggested as an alternative. Although the estimation mechanisms are different, both approaches claim to estimate the causal effect of treatment by appropriately adjusting for time-dependent confounding. We carry out simulation studies to assess the suitability of the sequential Cox approach for analyzing time-to-event data in the presence of a time-dependent covariate that may or may not be a time-dependent confounder. Results from these simulations revealed that the sequential Cox approach is not as effective as marginal structural Cox model in addressing the time-dependent confounding. The sequential Cox approach was also found to be inadequate in the presence of a time-dependent covariate. We propose a modified version of the sequential Cox approach that correctly estimates the treatment effect in both of the above scenarios. All approaches are applied to investigate the impact of beta-interferon treatment in delaying disability progression in the British Columbia Multiple Sclerosis cohort (1995-2008).

For example, a table might show odds ratios for one or more exposures and also for several confounders from a single logistic regression. This can lead to mistaken interpretations of these estimates. We use causal diagrams to display the sources of the problems. Presentation of exposure and confounder effect estimates from a single model may lead to several interpretative difficulties, inviting confusion of direct-effect estimates with total-effect estimates for covariates in the model. These effect estimates may also be confounded even though the effect estimate for the main exposure is not confounded. Interpretation of these effect estimates is further complicated by heterogeneity (variation, modification) of the exposure effect measure across covariate levels. We offer suggestions to limit potential misunderstandings when multiple effect estimates are presented, including precise distinction between total and direct effect measures from a single model, and use of multiple models tailored to yield total-effect estimates for covariates.

Comparative Effectiveness of Prostate Cancer Treatments: Evaluating Statistical Adjustments for Confounding in Observational Data	JNCI-JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE			English	Article							ANDROGEN DEPRIVATION THERAPY; INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE METHODS; HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY; PROPENSITY SCORE; RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY; BREAST-CANCER; MEDICARE CLAIMS; SELF-SELECTION; LUNG-CANCER; MEN	Background Using observational data to assess the relative effectiveness of alternative cancer treatments is limited by patient selection into treatment, which often biases interpretation of outcomes. We evaluated methods for addressing confounding in treatment and survival of patients with early-stage prostate cancer in observational data and compared findings with those from a benchmark randomized clinical trial. Methods We selected 14 302 early-stage prostate cancer patients who were aged 66-74 years and had been treated with radical prostatectomy or conservative management from linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 2003. Eligibility criteria were similar to those from a clinical trial used to benchmark our analyses. Survival was measured through December 31, 2007, by use of Cox proportional hazards models. We compared results from the benchmark trial with results from models with observational data by use of traditional multivariable survival analysis, propensity score adjustment, and instrumental variable analysis. Results Prostate cancer patients receiving conservative management were more likely to be older, nonwhite, and single and to have more advanced disease than patients receiving radical prostatectomy. In a multivariable survival analysis, conservative management was associated with greater risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality ( hazard ratio [HR] = 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.27 to 2.00) and all-cause mortality ( HR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.35 to 1.59) than radical prostatectomy. Propensity score adjustments resulted in similar patient characteristics across treatment groups, although survival results were similar to traditional multivariable survival analyses. Results for the same comparison from the instrumental variable approach, which theoretically equalizes both observed and unobserved patient characteristics across treatment groups, differed from the traditional multivariable and propensity score results but were consistent with findings from the subset of elderly patient with early-stage disease in the trial (ie, conservative management vs radical prostatectomy: for prostate cancer-specific mortality, HR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.08 to 6.73; for all-cause mortality, HR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.46 to 2.59). Conclusion Instrumental variable analysis may be a useful technique in comparative effectiveness studies of cancer treatments if an acceptable instrument can be identified.

J	Lindmark, A				Lindmark, Anita			Sensitivity analysis for unobserved confounding in causal mediation analysis allowing for effect modification, censoring and truncation	STATISTICAL METHODS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Causal inference; Indirect effect; Direct effect; Parametric estimation; Sequential ignorability; Uncertainty interval	BIAS FORMULAS; INFERENCE	Causal mediation analysis is used to decompose the total effect of an exposure on an outcome into an indirect effect, taking the path through an intermediate variable, and a direct effect. To estimate these effects, strong assumptions are made about unconfoundedness of the relationships between the exposure, mediator and outcome. These assumptions are difficult to verify in a given situation and therefore a mediation analysis should be complemented with a sensitivity analysis to assess the possible impact of violations. In this paper we present a method for sensitivity analysis to not only unobserved mediator-outcome confounding, which has largely been the focus of previous literature, but also unobserved confounding involving the exposure. The setting is estimation of natural direct and indirect effects based on parametric regression models. We present results for combinations of binary and continuous mediators and outcomes and extend the sensitivity analysis for mediator-outcome confounding to cases where the continuous outcome variable is censored or truncated. The proposed methods perform well also in the presence of interactions between the exposure, mediator and observed confounders, allowing for modeling flexibility as well as exploration of effect modification. The performance of the method is illustrated through simulations and an empirical example.

Consequently, there has been a recent focus on the development of data-driven methods for high-dimensional proxy confounder adjustment in pharmacoepidemiologic research. In this paper, we survey current approaches and recent advancements for high-dimensional proxy confounder adjustment in healthcare database studies. Methods We discuss considerations underpinning three areas for high-dimensional proxy confounder adjustment: (1) feature generation-transforming raw data into covariates (or features) to be used for proxy adjustment; (2) covariate prioritization, selection, and adjustment; and (3) diagnostic assessment. We discuss challenges and avenues of future development within each area. Results There is a large literature on methods for high-dimensional confounder prioritization/selection, but relatively little has been written on best practices for feature generation and diagnostic assessment. Consequently, these areas have particular limitations and challenges. Conclusions There is a growing body of evidence showing that machine-learning algorithms for high-dimensional proxy-confounder adjustment can supplement investigator-specified variables to improve confounding control compared to adjustment based on investigator-specified variables alone. However, more research is needed on best practices for feature generation and diagnostic assessment when applying methods for high-dimensional proxy confounder adjustment in pharmacoepidemiologic studies.

Several methods have been shown to consistently estimate a causal ordering assuming that all the model assumptions are correct. But the estimation results could be distorted if some assumptions are violated. In this letter, we propose a new algorithm for learning causal orders that is robust against one typical violation of the model assumptions: latent confounders. The key idea is to detect latent confounders by testing independence between estimated external influences and find subsets (parcels) that include variables unaffected by latent confounders. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using artificial data and simulated brain imaging data.

To study the potential for ecological Variables to reduce confounding by indication, we used a large database of admissions for ruptured cerebral aneurysms to evaluate the association of in-hospital death with treatment type-surgery or endovascular therapy. We compared results of three multivariable models: individual-level, ecological, and a two-level model with an ecological treatment variable and individual-level covariates and outcome. Trends in the individual-level and ecological models were in opposite directions. suggesting confounding by indication in the individual-level analysis. The two-level analysis revealed a strong association between institutional utilization of endovascular therapy and reduced individual risk of in-hospital death. Using an ecological treatment variable in an individual analysis may combine reduced confounding by indication in ecological analyses with increased power and more precise specification of outcomes and covariates in individual-level analyses.

J	Tai, AS; Lin, SH				Tai, An-Shun; Lin, Sheng-Hsuan			Complete effect decomposition for an arbitrary number of multiple ordered mediators with time-varying confounders: A method for generalized causal multi-mediation analysis	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Causal mediation analysis; time-varying confounders; interventional approach; multiple ordered mediator; pathway analysis; counterfactual	CHRONIC HEPATITIS-B; HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA; RISK; INFERENCE; EXPOSURES; MORTALITY; MODELS	Causal mediation analysis is advantageous for mechanism investigation. In settings with multiple causally ordered mediators, path-specific effects have been introduced to specify the effects of certain combinations of mediators. However, most path-specific effects are unidentifiable. An interventional analog of path-specific effects is adapted to address the non-identifiability problem. Moreover, previous studies only focused on cases with two or three mediators due to the complexity of the mediation formula in a large number of mediators. In this study, we provide a generalized definition of traditional path-specific effects and interventional path-specific effects with a recursive formula, along with the required assumptions for nonparametric identification. Subsequently, a general approach is developed with an arbitrary number of multiple ordered mediators and with time-varying confounders. All methods and software proposed in this study contribute to comprehensively decomposing a causal effect confirmed by data science and help disentangling causal mechanisms in the presence of complicated causal structures among multiple mediators.

A study with an aggregate exposure variable. P-E but with outcome, group membership, and covariates assessed individually is partially ecologic. In this paper, P-1, is the proportion exposed; P-E can vary across geographic areas or occupational groups. Methods Several hypothetical scenarios were considered, varying the baseline risk. the exposure effect. the exposure distribution across groups, the impact of the (unmeasured) confounder. and the confounder distribution across groups. First, confounding within groups was introduced, Thereafter, confounding between groups was introduced by co-varying P-E and the confounder prevalence across the groups. The expected odds ratio (exposed versus unexposed) was calculated in two alternative models. the logistic regression and linear odds models, both with P-E as the independent variable. Moreover, empirical data on noise expo, sure and sleeping disturbances were analyzed. Results Compared with the logistic regression model, the linear odds model yielded a markedly less-biased odds ratio (OR) when the outcome was rare ( <= 5% baseline risk). Confounding within groups resulted in marginal bias, whereas confounding between groups resulted in more pronounced bias, Conclusions A logistic regression analysis, with P-E as an independent variable, can yield substantial model misspecification bias. By contrast, the linear odds model is valid when the outcome is rare, Confounding between groups should be of more concern than confounding within groups in partially ecologic analyses,	Univ Lund Hosp, Competence Ctr Clin Res, SE-22185 Lund, Sweden; Lund Univ, Dept Occupat & Environm Med, Lund, Sweden	Lund University; Skane University Hospital; Lund University	Univ Lund Hosp, Competence Ctr Clin Res, SE-22185 Lund, Sweden.

J	Norström, F; Hammarström, A				Norstrom, Fredrik; Hammarstrom, Anne			Methodological perspectives on the study of the health effects of unemployment - reviewing the mode of unemployment, the statistical analysis method and the role of confounding factors	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Unemployment; Labour market; Propensity score weighting; G-computation; Biased estimates	PROPENSITY SCORE METHODS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; REGRESSION; QUALITY	Introduction Studying the relationship between unemployment and health raises many methodological challenges. In the current study, the aim was to evaluate the sensitivity of estimates based on different ways of measuring unemployment and the choice of statistical model. Methods The Northern Swedish cohort was used, and two follow-up surveys thereof from 1995 and 2007, as well as register data about unemployment. Self-reported current unemployment, self-reported accumulated unemployment and register-based accumulated unemployment were used to measure unemployment and its effect on self-reported health was evaluated. Analyses were conducted with G-computation, logistic regression and three estimators for the inverse probability weighting propensity scores, and 11 potentially confounding variables were part of the analyses. Results were presented with absolute differences in the proportion with poor self-reported health between unemployed and employed individuals, except when logistic regression was used alone. Results Of the initial 1083 pupils in the cohort, our analyses vary between 488-693 individuals defined as employed and 61-214 individuals defined as unemployed. In the analyses, the deviation was large between the unemployment measures, with a difference of at least 2.5% in effect size when unemployed was compared with employed for the self-reported and register-based unemployment modes. The choice of statistical method only had a small influence on effect estimates and the deviation was in most cases lower than 1%. When models were compared based on the choice of potential confounders in the analytical model, the deviations were rarely above 0.6% when comparing models with 4 and 11 potential confounders. Our variable for health selection was the only one that strongly affected estimates when it was not part of the statistical model. Conclusions How unemployment is measured is highly important when the relationship between unemployment and health is estimated. However, misspecifications of the statistical model or choice of analytical method might not matter much for estimates except for the inclusion of a variable measuring health status before becoming unemployed. Our results can guide researchers when analysing similar research questions. Model diagnostics is commonly lacking in publications, but they remain very important for validation of analyses.

Time-modified Confounding	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						bias (epidemiology); confounding factors (epidemiology); structural model	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL; CAUSAL INFERENCE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; DEFINITION; MORTALITY; KNOWLEDGE; RATIO; BIAS	According to the authors, time-modified confounding occurs when the causal relation between a time-fixed or time-varying confounder and the treatment or outcome changes over time. A key difference between previously described time-varying confounding and the proposed time-modified confounding is that, in the former, the values of the confounding variable change over time while, in the latter, the effects of the confounder change over time. Using marginal structural models, the authors propose an approach to account for time-modified confounding when the relation between the confounder and treatment is modified over time. An illustrative example and simulation show that, when time-modified confounding is present, a marginal structural model with inverse probability-of-treatment weights specified to account for time-modified confounding remains approximately unbiased with appropriate confidence limit coverage, while models that do not account for time-modified confounding are biased. Correct specification of the treatment model, including accounting for potential variation over time in confounding, is an important assumption of marginal structural models. When the effect of confounders on either the treatment or outcome changes over time, time-modified confounding should be considered.

These associations are commonly caused by confusion derived from social, environmental, and behavioral factors, which can be difficult to measure. Mendelian randomization is based on the selection of genetic variants that are used as instrumental variables that influence exposure patterns or are associated with an intermediate phenotype of the disease. The present work aims to discuss how to select the appropriate genetic variants as instrumental variables and to present methodological tools to deal with the limitations of this epidemiological method. The use of instrumental variables for modifiable exposures has the potential to mitigate the effects of common limitations, such as confusion, when robust genetic variants are chosen as instrumental variables.

Recent work has applied causal inference to eliminate or reduce control and data flow dependence confounding bias in statement-level statistical debuggers. The result is improved effectiveness. This is encouraging but motivates two novel questions: (1) how can causal inference be applied in predicate-level statistical debuggers and (2) what other biases can be eliminated or reduced. Here we address both questions by providing a model that eliminates or reduces control flow dependence and failure flow confounding bias within predicate-level statistical debuggers. We present empirical results demonstrating that our model significantly improves the effectiveness of a variety of predicate-level statistical debuggers, including those that eliminate or reduce only a single source of confounding bias.

However, it is well known that fMRI is sensitive not only to neuronal activity, but also to many other psychophysiological responses which may be task-related, such as changes in cardio-respiratory activity. They are not explicitly taken into account in the generative models of DCM and their effects on estimated neuronal connectivity are not known. The main goal of this study was to report the face validity of DCM in the presence of strong physiological confounds that presumably cannot be corrected for, using an fMRI experiment of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) performed in rats. First, a simple simulation was used to evaluate the principled ability of DCM to recover directed connectivity in the presence of a confounding factor. Second, we tested the experimental validity using measures of the BOLD correlates of left 5 Hz VNS. Because VNS mostly activates the central autonomic regulation system, fMRI signals were likely to represent both direct and indirect vascular responses to such activation. In addition to the inference of standard statistical parametric maps, DCM was thus used to estimate directed neural connectivity in a small brain network including the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) known to receive vagal afferents. Though blood pressure changes may constitute a major physiological confound in this dataset, model comparison of DCMs still allowed the identification of the NTS as the input station of the VNS pathway to the brain. Our study indicates that current developments of DCM are robust to psychophysiological responses to some extent, but does not exclude the need to develop specific models of brain body interactions within the DCM framework to better estimate neuronal connectivity from fMRI time series.

A crucial source of violation of the internal validity of a study involves bias arising from confounding, which is always a challenge in observational research, including life course epidemiology. The increasingly popular approach of meta-analyzing individual participant data from several observational studies also brings up to discussion the problem of confounding when combining data from different populations. In this study, we review and discuss the most common sources of confounding in life course epidemiology: (i) confounding by indication, (ii) impact of baseline selection on confounding, (iii) time-varying confounding and (iv) mediator-outcome confounding. We also discuss the issue of addressing confounding in the context of an individual participant data meta-analysis.

Ignoring selection bias can result in unreliable or misleading estimates of the causal effect. Generalized boosted models were used to estimate propensity scores from 42 confounding variables for a sample of 361 neonates. Using emergent neonatal attention and orientation skills as an example developmental outcome, we examined the impact of tobacco exposure with and without accounting for selection bias. Weight at birth, an outcome related to tobacco exposure, also was used to examine the functionality of the propensity score approach. Without inclusion of propensity scores, tobacco-exposed neonates did not differ from their nonexposed peers in attention skills over the first month or in weight at birth. When the propensity score was included as a covariate, exposed infants had marginally lower attention and a slower linear change rate at 4 weeks, with greater quadratic deceleration over the first month. Similarly, exposure-related differences in birth weight emerged when propensity scores were included as a covariate. The propensity score method captured the selection bias intrinsic to this observational study of prenatal tobacco exposure. Selection bias obscured the deleterious impact of tobacco exposure on the development of neonatal attention. The illustrated analytic strategy offers an example to better characterize the impact of prenatal tobacco exposure on important developmental outcomes by directly modeling and statistically accounting for the selection bias from the sampling process.

It is used to estimate the causal effect of time-varying exposures on an outcome in the presence of time-varying confounders that are themselves also affected by the exposures. The procedure also addresses the related problem of estimating direct and indirect effects when the causal effect of the exposures on an outcome is mediated by intermediate variables, and in particular when confounders of the mediator-outcome relationships are themselves affected by the exposures. A brief overview of the theory and a description of the command and its options are given, and illustrations using two simulated examples are provided.

J	Liu, X; Wang, LJ				Liu, Xiao; Wang, Lijuan			The Impact of Measurement Error and Omitting Confounders on Statistical Inference of Mediation Effects and Tools for Sensitivity Analysis	PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS			English	Article						mediation; measurement error; confounding; sensitivity analysis; causal inference	CAUSAL INFERENCE; EFFECT SIZE; VARIABLES; MODELS; BIAS; DESIGN	To make valid statistical inferences from mediation analysis, a number of assumptions need to be assessed. Among the assumptions, 2 frequently discussed ones are (a) the independent variable, mediator, and outcome variables are measured without error; and (b) no confounders of the effects in the mediation model are omitted. The impact of violating either assumption alone on statistical inference of mediation has been discussed in previous literature. In practice, violations of the 2 assumptions often co-occur. In this study, we analytically investigated the effects of measurement error and omitting confounders on statistical inference of mediation effects, including both point estimation and significance testing. Based on the analytical results, we proposed sensitivity analysis techniques for assessing the robustness of mediation inference to the violation of the 2 assumptions. To implement the techniques, we developed R functions and a user-friendly web tool. Simulated-data and real-data examples were provided for illustrations. We hope the developed tools will help researchers conduct sensitivity analyses of mediation inference more conveniently.

Evaluating sources of bias in observational studies of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin II receptor blocker use during COVID-19: beyond confounding	JOURNAL OF HYPERTENSION			English	Review						angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; causal inference; causal mediation; causal model; collider; directed acyclic graph; hypertension; immortal time; renin--angiotensin system; severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2	PROPENSITY SCORE; HOSPITALIZED-PATIENTS; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; MEDIATION ANALYSIS; OUTCOMES; SELECTION; SYSTEM; INHIBITORS; EXPOSURES; TUTORIAL	Concerns over ACE inhibitor or ARB use to treat hypertension during COVID-19 remain unresolved. Although studies using more robust methodologies provided some clarity, sources of bias persist and it remains critical to quickly address this question. In this review, we discuss pernicious sources of bias using a causal model framework, including time-varying confounder, collider, information, and time-dependent bias, in the context of recently published studies. We discuss causal inference methodologies that can address these issues, including causal diagrams, time-to-event analyses, sensitivity analyses, and marginal structural modeling. We discuss effect modification and we propose a role for causal mediation analysis to estimate indirect effects via mediating factors, especially components of the renin--angiotensin system. Thorough knowledge of these sources of bias and the appropriate methodologies to address them is crucial when evaluating observational studies to inform patient management decisions regarding whether ACE inhibitors or ARBs are associated with greater risk from COVID-19.

J	Schnell, PM; Papadogeorgou, G				Schnell, Patrick M.; Papadogeorgou, Georgia			MITIGATING UNOBSERVED SPATIAL CONFOUNDING WHEN ESTIMATING THE EFFECT OF SUPERMARKET ACCESS ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE DEATHS	ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Causal inference; cardiovascular disease; food access; Markov random field spatial confounding; unmeasured confounding	PROPENSITY SCORE; FOOD STORES; REGRESSION; SELECTION; MODELS; SENSITIVITY; INFERENCE; DESIGN	Confounding by unmeasured spatial variables has received some attention in the spatial statistics and causal inference literatures, but concepts and approaches have remained largely separated. In this paper we aim to bridge these distinct strands of statistics by considering unmeasured spatial confounding within a causal inference framework and estimating effects using outcome regression tools popular within the spatial literature. First, we show how using spatially correlated random effects in the outcome model, an approach common among spatial statisticians, does not necessarily mitigate bias due to spatial confounding, a previously published but not universally known result. Motivated by the bias term of commonly-used estimators, we propose an affine estimator which addresses this deficiency. We discuss how unbiased estimation of causal parameters in the presence of unmeasured spatial confounding can only be achieved under an untestable set of assumptions which will often be application specific. We provide a set of assumptions which describe how the exposure and outcome of interest relate to the unmeasured variables, and we show that this set of assumptions is sufficient for identification of the causal effect based on the observed data when spatial dependencies can be represented by a ring graph. We implement our method using a fully Bayesian approach applicable to any type of outcome variable. This work is motivated by and used to estimate the effect of county-level limited access to supermarkets on the rate of cardiovascular disease deaths in the elderly across the whole continental United States. Even though standard approaches return null or protective effects, our approach uncovers evidence of unobserved spatial confounding and indicates that limited supermarket access has a harmful effect on cardiovascular mortality.

We propose a semiparametric identification of natural direct and indirect effects in the presence of unmeasured mediatoroutcome confounding by leveraging heteroskedasticity restrictions on the observed data law. For inference, we develop semiparametric estimators that remain consistent under partial misspecifications of the observed data model. We illustrate the proposed estimators using simulations and an application that evaluates the effect of self-efficacy on fatigue among health care workers during the COVID-19 outbreak.

Treatment Effects in the Presence of Unmeasured Confounding: Dealing With Observations in the Tails of the Propensity Score Distribution-A Simulation Study	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						bias (epidemiology); causal inference; cohort studies; confounding factors (epidemiology); epidemiologic methods; models, statistical; propensity score; research design	ADJUSTMENT; MORTALITY	Frailty, a poorly measured confounder in older patients, can promote treatment in some situations and discourage it in others. This can create unmeasured confounding and lead to nonuniform treatment effects over the propensity score (PS). The authors compared bias and mean squared error for various PS implementations under PS trimming, thereby excluding persons treated contrary to prediction. Cohort studies were simulated with a binary treatment T as a function of 8 covariates X. Two of the covariates were assumed to be unmeasured strong risk factors for the outcome and present in persons treated contrary to prediction. The outcome Y was simulated as a Poisson function of T and all X's. In analyses based on measured covariates only, the range of PS's was trimmed asymmetrically according to the percentile of PS in treated patients at the lower end and in untreated patients at the upper end. PS trimming reduced bias due to unmeasured confounders and mean squared error in most scenarios assessed. Treatment effect estimates based on PS range restrictions do not correspond to a causal parameter but may be less biased by such unmeasured confounding. Increasing validity based on PS trimming may be a unique advantage of PS's over conventional outcome models.

However, most existing models are designed based on the assumption that there are no confounders between the exposure, the mediators, and the outcome. In practice, this assumption may not be feasible since high-dimensional mediation analysis (HIMA) tends to be observational where a randomized controlled trial (RCT) cannot be conducted for some economic or ethical reasons. Thus, to deal with the confounders in HIMA cases, we proposed three propensity score-related approaches named PSR (propensity score regression), PSW (propensity score weighting), and PSU (propensity score union) to adjust for the confounder bias in HIMA, and compared them with the traditional covariate regression method. The procedures mainly include four parts: calculating the propensity score, sure independence screening, MCP (minimax concave penalty) variable selection, and joint-significance testing. Simulation results show that the PSU model is the most recommended. Applying our models to the TCGA lung cancer dataset, we find that smoking may lead to lung disease through the mediation effect of some specific DNA-methylation sites, including site Cg24480765 in gene RP11-347H15.2 and site Cg22051776 in gene KLF3.

If the number of covariates is large relative to the number of observations, then controlling for all available covariates is infeasible. In cases where a sparsity condition holds, variable selection or penalization can reduce the dimension of the covariate space in a manner that allows for valid estimation of treatment effects. In this article, we propose matching on both the estimated propensity score and the estimated prognostic scores when the number of covariates is large relative to the number of observations. We derive asymptotic results for the matching estimator and show that it is doubly robust in the sense that only one of the two score models need be correct to obtain a consistent estimator. We show via simulation its effectiveness in controlling for confounding and highlight its potential to address nonlinear confounding. Finally, we apply the proposed procedure to analyze the effect of gender on prescription opioid use using insurance claims data.

James			An instrumental variable procedure for estimating Cox models with non-proportional hazards in the presence of unmeasured confounding	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Causal inference; Control function; Cox regression model; Time-dependent coefficients; Time-modified confounding	CAUSAL INFERENCE; FRAILTY MODELS; SURVIVAL; BIAS	Two-stage instrumental variable methods are commonly used for estimating average causal effects in the presence of an unmeasured confounder. In the context of the proportional hazard Cox regression models, this problem has recently received attention with several methods being proposed. Previously, we developed an improved estimator under the incumbent two-stage residual inclusion procedure called '2SRI' by adding a Gaussian frailty in the second stage. We now consider the more complex situation in which the treatment and the unmeasured confounders can have time varying effects, illustrating the method with the case of a step function with one prespecified change point. We prove that, in situations where the effects of the unmeasured confounder or the treatment change during the follow-up, the first stage of the 2SRI algorithm induces a frailty with time varying coefficients in the second stage, which enables incumbent methods and our previously developed procedure to be improved on. A Monte Carlo simulation study demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed extension of 2SRI that we develop. We apply the new procedure to estimate the effect of endarterectomy versus carotid artery stenting on the time to death of patients suffering from carotid artery disease by using linked vascular quality initiative registry-Medicare data.

Bias is evident when estimating influenza vaccine effectiveness, even after adjustment for claims-based indicators of illness. We explored bias reduction methods while estimating vaccine effectiveness in a cohort of adult hemodialysis patients. Using the United States Renal Data System and linked data from a commercial dialysis provider, we estimated vaccine effectiveness using a Cox proportional hazards marginal structural model of all-cause mortality before and during 3 influenza seasons in 2005/2006 through 2007/2008. To improve confounding control, we added frailty indicators to the model, measured time-varying confounders at different time intervals, and restricted the sample in multiple ways. Crude and baseline-adjusted marginal structural models remained strongly biased. Restricting to a healthier population removed some unmeasured confounding; however, this reduced the sample size, resulting in wide confidence intervals. We estimated an influenza vaccine effectiveness of 9% (hazard ratio = 0.91, 95% confidence interval: 0.72, 1.15) when bias was minimized through cohort restriction. In this study, the healthy-user bias could not be controlled through statistical adjustment; however, sample restriction reduced much of the bias.	[McGrath, Leah J.; Brookhart, M.

However, in the literature, the term confounding by indication is not always used consistently. The authors found three different situations in which the term has been applied or might have been used but was not: confounding by indication as protopathic bias, as confounding by severity, or as a form of selection bias. It might be helpful to limit use of the term confounding by indication to the situation in which the disease that forms the indication acts as a confounder irrespective of its severity and to apply the term confounding by severity ii the severity of this disease acts as a confounder. Protopathic bias and selection bias should not be confused with these terms. The use of appropriate terms ultimately will improve communication among researchers and contribute to the clarity of their papers.

Objective: To determine the frequency and adequacy of adjustment for confounding in medical articles. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: 34 scientific medical journals with a high impact factor. Measurements: Frequency of reporting on methods used to adjust for confounding in 537 original research articles published in January 1998. Results: Of the 537 articles, 169 specified that adjustment for confounding was used. In 1 paper in 10, it was unclear which statistical method was used or for which variables adjustment was made. In 45% of papers, it was not clear how multicategory or continuous variables were treated in the analysis. inadequate reporting was less frequent if an author was affiliated with a department of statistics, epidemiology, or public health and if articles were published in journals with a high impact factor. Conclusions: Details of methods used to adjust for confounding are frequently not reported in original research articles.

This article establishes an "orthogonal" score for learning treatment effects, using observational data with a potentially large number of confounders. The estimator allows for root-n, asymptotically valid confidence intervals, despite the bias induced by the regularization. Moreover, we develop a novel hazard difference (HDi), estimator. We establish rate double robustness through the cross-fitting formulation. Numerical experiments illustrate the finite sample performance, where we observe that the cross-fitted HDi estimator has the best performance. We study the radical prostatectomy's effect on conservative prostate cancer management through the SEER-Medicare linked data. Last, we provide an extension to machine learning both approaches and heterogeneous treatment effects. for this article are available online.

Doubly robust estimators of causal exposure effects with missing data in the outcome, exposure or a confounder	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	32nd Annual Conference of the International-Society-for-Clinical-Biostatistics	AUG 21-25, 2011	Ontario, CANADA			double-robustness; inverse probability weighting; G-computation; confounding; missing data; observational study	PROPENSITY SCORE; MULTIPLE IMPUTATION; REGRESSION-MODELS; G-COMPUTATION; INFERENCE; EFFICIENCY	We consider the estimation of the causal effect of a binary exposure on a continuous outcome. Confounding and missing data are both likely to occur in practice when observational data are used to estimate this causal effect. In dealing with each of these problems, model misspecification is likely to introduce bias. We present augmented inverse probability weighted (AIPW) estimators that account for both confounding and missing data, with the latter occurring in a single variable only. These estimators have an element of robustness to misspecification of the models used. Our estimators require two models to be specified to deal with confounding and two to deal with missing data. Only one of each of these models needs to be correctly specified. When either the outcome or the exposure of interest is missing, we derive explicit expressions for the AIPW estimator. When a confounder is missing, explicit derivation is complex, so we use a simple algorithm, which can be applied using standard statistical software, to obtain an approximation to the AIPW estimator.

To derive the criterion for a factor to be a confounder given by Miettinen and Cook and to clarify inconsistency between various criteria for a confounder, we introduce the concepts of an irrelevant factor, an occasional confounder and a uniformly irrelevant factor. We discuss criteria for checking these and show that Miettinen and Cook's criterion can also be applied to occasional confounders. Moreover, we consider situations with multiple potential confounders, and we obtain two necessary conditions that are satisfied by each confounder set. None of the definitions and results presented in this paper require the ignorability and sufficient control confounding assumptions which are commonly employed in observational and epidemiological studies.

Potential confounding by exposure history and prior outcomes - An example from perinatal epidemiology	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; CLEARER DEFINITION; PREGNANCY OUTCOMES; CAUSAL INFERENCE; RISK; DEFECTS; TIME; BIAS	Prior pregnancy outcomes, such as spontaneous abortion and preterm birth, are often predictive of future pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, many researchers adjust for reproductive history. Although this adjustment may be appropriate for a predictive model, it is not necessarily appropriate when the goal is to obtain an unbiased estimate of the effect of exposure on disease. Reproductive history may seem to meet the conventional criteria for confounding because it is unlikely to be on the causal pathway between exposure and current outcome, is often associated with current outcome, and may be associated with exposure as well. However, whether reproductive history is a confounder or not depends on the underlying reason for its associations with exposure and current outcome. Thus, conventional methods for assessing confounding are often inadequate. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) can be used to evaluate complex scenarios for confounding when the research question is clearly defined with respect to the exposure, the outcome, and the effect estimate of interest. Special care is required when reproductive history affects future exposure. We use 5 DAGs to illustrate possible relations between reproductive history and current outcome. We assess each DAG for confounding, and identify the appropriate analytic technique. We provide a numeric example using data from the Collaborative Perinatal Project. There is no single answer as to whether reproductive history should be included in the model; the decision depends on the research question and the underlying DAG.

Methods: We compare previously proposed simulation-based approach for confounder identification that can be tailored to each specific study and contrast it with commonly applied methods (significance criteria with cutoff levels of p-values of 0.05 or 0.20, and CIE criterion with a cutoff of 10 %), as well as newly proposed two-stage procedure aimed at reduction of false positives (specifically, risk factors that are not confounders). The new procedure first evaluates potential for confounding by examination of correlation of covariates and applies simulated CIE criteria only if there is evidence of correlation, while rejecting a covariate as confounder otherwise. These approaches are compared in simulations studies with binary, continuous, and survival outcomes. We illustrate the application of our proposed confounder identification strategy in examining the association of exposure to mercury in relation to depression in the presence of suspected confounding by fish intake using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2009-2010 data. Results: Our simulations showed that the simulation-determined cutoff was very sensitive to measurement error in exposure and potential confounder. The analysis of NHANES data demonstrated that if the noise-to-signal ratio (error variance in confounder/variance of confounder) is at or below 0.5, roughly 80 % of the simulated analyses adjusting for fish consumption would correctly result in a null association of mercury and depression, and only an extremely poorly measured confounder is not useful to adjust for in this setting. Conclusions: No a prior criterion developed for a specific application is guaranteed to be suitable for confounder identification in general. The customization of model-building strategies and study designs through simulations that consider the likely imperfections in the data, as well as finite-sample behavior, would constitute an important improvement on some of the currently prevailing practices in confounder identification and evaluation.

Comparison of Instrumental Variable Analysis Using a New Instrument With Risk Adjustment Methods to Reduce Confounding by Indication	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						asthma; comparative effectiveness research; confounding factors (epidemiology); instrumental variable; propensity score; risk adjustment; therapeutics	PROPENSITY SCORE; PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT; BREAST-CANCER; ASTHMA; HETEROGENEITY; IDENTIFICATION; SELECTION; DATABASE; THERAPY; BIAS	Confounding by indication is a vexing problem, especially in evaluating treatment effects using observational data, since treatment decisions are often related to disease severity, prognosis, and frailty. To compare the ability of the instrumental variable (IV) approach with a new instrument based on the local-area practice style and risk adjustment methods, including conventional multivariate regression and propensity score adjustment, to reduce confounding by indication, the authors investigated the effects of long-term control (LTC) therapy on the occurrence of acute asthma exacerbation events among children and young adults with incident and uncontrolled persistent asthma, using Iowa Medicaid claims files from 1997-1999. Established evidence from clinical trials has demonstrated the protective benefits of LTC therapy for persistent asthma. Among patients identified (n = 4,275), those with higher asthma severity at baseline were more likely to receive LTC therapy. The multivariate regression and propensity score adjustment methods suggested that LTC therapy had no effect on the occurrence of acute exacerbation events. Estimates from the new IV approach showed that LTC therapy significantly decreased the occurrence of acute exacerbation events, which is consistent with established clinical evidence. The authors discuss how to interpret estimates from the risk adjustment and IV methods when the treatment effect is heterogeneous.

Traditional approaches for dealing with confounding, despite improvements in study design and statistical analysis, are inadequate. Using aquatic biota as a case study, this review explains the limitations of traditional methods used to separate the impact of human-made pollution from natural variation in the environment. Advantages and disadvantages of the traditional and novel techniques are enumerated. Bayesian networks (BNs) and structural equation modelling (SEM) as causal modelling techniques are introduced as approaches to improve environmental impact monitoring.

Time-Dependent Confounding in the Study of the Effects of Regular Physical Activity in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: An Application of the Marginal Structural Model	ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Confounding Factors (Epidemiology); Epidemiology; Epidemiologic Methods; Exercise; Models; Statistical; Motor Activity; Pulmonary Disease; Chronic Obstructive	BODY-COMPOSITION; RISK; MORTALITY; LIMITATION; SURVIVAL; DECLINE; DEATH; COPD	PURPOSE: Results from longitudinal studies about the association between physical activity and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may have been biased because they did not properly adjust for time-dependent confounders. Marginal structural models (MSMs) have been proposed to address this type of confounding. We sought to assess the presence of time-dependent confounding in the association between physical activity and COPD development and course by comparing risk estimates between standard statistical methods and MSMs. METHODS: By using the population-based cohort Copenhagen City Heart Study, 6,568 subjects selected from the general population in 1976 were followed up until 2004 with three repeated examinations. RESULTS: Moderate to high compared with low physical activity was associated with a reduced risk of developing COPD both in the standard analysis (odds ratio [OR] 0.76, p = 0.007) and in the MSM analysis (OR 0.79, p = 0.025). In the subgroup with COPD (n = 2,226), high physical activity was associated with a reduced risk of COPD admissions during follow-up (standard, incidence rate ratio, 0.74; p = 0.096; MSM, 0.68, p = 0.044), and with a reduced risk of mortality (standard, hazard ratio 0.80, p = 0.001; MSM, 0.81, p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: These results support the previously reported associations between physical activity and reduced risk of COPD development, hospitalizations, and mortality, thereby suggesting they were not due to time-dependent confounding.

Addressing missing data in confounders when estimating propensity scores for continuous exposures	HEALTH SERVICES AND OUTCOMES RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Generalized propensity scores; Missing data; Causal inference; Continuous exposures	MULTIPLE IMPUTATION; CAUSAL INFERENCE	Propensity score models are frequently used to estimate causal effects in observational studies. One unresolved issue in fitting these models is handling missing values in the propensity score model covariates. As these models usually contain a large set of covariates, using only individuals with complete data significantly decreases the sample size and statistical power. Several missing data imputation approaches have been proposed, including multiple imputation (MI), MI with missingness pattern (MIMP), and treatment mean imputation. Generalized boosted modeling (GBM), which is a nonparametric approach to estimate propensity scores, can automatically handle missingness in the covariates. Although the performance of MI, MIMP, and treatment mean imputation have previously been compared for binary treatments, they have not been compared for continuous exposures or with single imputation and GBM. We compared these approaches in estimating the generalized propensity score (GPS) for a continuous exposure in both a simulation study and in empirical data. Using GBM with the incomplete data to estimate the GPS did not perform well in the simulation. Missing values should be imputed before estimating propensity scores using GBM or any other approach for estimating the GPS.

We demonstrate the use of multiple PS estimation methods to optimize covariate balance. Methods: We used secondary data from 1292 adults with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression trial (2001-2004). After initial citalopram treatment failed, patient preference influenced assignment to medication augmentation (n = 565) or switch (n = 727). To reduce selection bias, we used boosted classification and regression trees (BCART) and logistic regression iteratively to identify two potentially optimal PSs. We assessed and compared covariate balance. Results: After iterative selection of interaction terms to minimize imbalance, logistic regression yielded better balance than BCART (average standardized absolute mean difference across 47 covariates: 0.03 vs. 0.08, matching; 0.02 vs. 0.05, weighting). Conclusions: Comparing multiple PS estimates is a pragmatic way to optimize balance. Logistic regression remains valuable for this purpose. Simulation studies are needed to compare PS models under varying conditions. Such studies should consider more flexible estimation methods, such as logistic models with automated selection of interactions or hybrid models using main effects logistic regression instead of a constant log-odds as the initial model for BCART.

Quantitative Bias Analysis for a Misclassified Confounder A Comparison Between Marginal Structural Models and Conditional Models for Point Treatments	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Inverse probability weighting; Marginal structural models; Misclassification; Point-treatment study; Quantitative bias analysis	MEASUREMENT-ERROR; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; WEIGHTS	Observational data are increasingly used with the aim of estimating causal effects of treatments, through careful control for confounding. Marginal structural models estimated using inverse probability weighting (MSMs-IPW), like other methods to control for confounding, assume that confounding variables are measured without error. The average treatment effect in an MSM-IPW may however be biased when a confounding variable is error prone. Using the potential outcome framework, we derive expressions for the bias due to confounder misclassification in analyses that aim to estimate the average treatment effect using an marginal structural model estimated using inverse probability weighting (MSM-IPW). We compare this bias with the bias due to confounder misclassification in analyses based on a conditional regression model. Focus is on a point-treatment study with a continuous outcome. Compared with bias in the average treatment effect in a conditional model, the bias in an MSM-IPW can be different in magnitude but is equal in sign. Also, we use a simulation study to investigate the finite sample performance of MSM-IPW and conditional models when a confounding variable is misclassified. Simulation results indicate that confidence intervals of the treatment effect obtained from MSM-IPW are generally wider, and coverage of the true treatment effect is higher compared with a conditional model, ranging from overcoverage if there is no confounder misclassification to undercoverage when there is confounder misclassification. Further, we illustrate in a study of blood pressure-lowering therapy, how the bias expressions can be used to inform a quantitative bias analysis to study the impact of confounder misclassification, supported by an online tool.

When there are time-varying confounders, which may include past outcomes, affected by prior exposure, standard regression methods can lead to bias. Methods such as inverse probability weighted estimation of marginal structural models have been developed to address this problem. However, in this paper we show how standard regression methods can be used, even in the presence of time-dependent confounding, to estimate the total effect of an exposure on a subsequent outcome by controlling appropriately for prior exposures, outcomes, and time-varying covariates. We refer to the resulting estimation approach as sequential conditional mean models (SCMMs), which can be fitted using generalized estimating equations. We outline this approach and describe how including propensity score adjustment is advantageous. We compare the causal effects being estimated using SCMMs and marginal structural models, and we compare the two approaches using simulations. SCMMs enable more precise inferences, with greater robustness against model misspecification via propensity score adjustment, and easily accommodate continuous exposures and interactions. A new test for direct effects of past exposures on a subsequent outcome is described.

EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						selection bias; confounding; magnetic fields; wire codes; childhood leukemia; case-control studies	ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC-LEUKEMIA; CHILDHOOD-CANCER; WIRE CODES; EXPOSURE; NONRESPONDENTS; RESPONDENTS; ASSOCIATION	In contrast with several previous studies, our recent large case-control study found little association between childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and electric-power-line wire codes. Here we examine internal evidence from our study to assess the possibility that selection bias and/or confounding may have affected the findings. We compared the relation between childhood ALL and wire codes and direct measurements of magnetic fields in subjects who participated in all phases of the study with the relation in all subjects, including those who declined to allow access inside the home. We found that the odds ratio for ALL among those living in homes with very high current configurations increased by 23% when 107 "partial participants" were excluded. We found similar, but slightly smaller, increases in the odds ratios when we performed the same comparisons using direct measurements of magnetic fields, excluding subjects who allowed only a measurement outside the front door. "Partial participants" tended to be characterized by lower socioeconomic status than subjects who participated fully, suggesting possible selection bias. We also examined the relation between a large number of potential confounding variables and both proxy and direct measurements of magnetic fields. Univariate adjustment for individual variables changed the odds ratio for ALL by less than 8%, while simultaneous adjustment for several factors reduced the estimate by a maximum of 15%. We conclude that while confounding alone is unlikely to be an important source of bias in our own and previous studies of magnetic fields, selection bias may be more of a concern, particularly in light of the generally low response rates among controls in case-control studies.

This type of confounding, whereby confounders of the effect of mediator on outcome are themselves affected by the exposure, complicates mediation analyses and necessitates apt analysis strategies. In this article, we contrast the inverse probability weighting approach with the traditional path analysis approach to mediation analysis. We show that in a particular class of linear models, adjustment for posttreatment confounding can be realized via a fairly standard modification of the traditional path analysis approach. The resulting approach is simpler; by avoiding inverse probability weighting, it moreover results in direct effect estimators with smaller finite sample bias and greater precision. We further show that a particular variant of the G-estimation approach from the causal inference literature is equivalent with the path analysis approach in simple linear settings but is more generally applicable in settings with interactions and/or noncontinuous mediators and confounders. We conclude that the use of inverse probability weighting for marginal structural models to adjust for posttreatment confounding in mediation analysis is primarily indicated in nonlinear models for the outcome.

Analyses of many species and characters can reveal general principles applicable to the special case of human evolution and are, indeed, essential for testing of explanations based on simple correlations. Biological systems are complex and a simple association or correlation between any two features will often not reveal a direct causal connection. Interactions with potentially confounding variables must be exhaustively explored in order to establish the criterion of isolation. Multiple allometric scaling analyses provide a useful method for comparative studies, although there are three major practical problems (choice of line-fitting procedure, recognition of grade shifts, appropriate control for degree of phylogenetic relatedness) in addition to the universal problem of confounding variables. One special exam pie of sim pie association is the apparent temporal coincidence of features in the fossil record (e.g., between the earliest finds of stone tools and the first evidence of increased brain size) and here the estimation of times of origin is of particular importance. Broad comparative evidence indicates that there has been systematic underestimation of dates of origin in the primate tree, such that widely cited times of divergence among hominids are probably too recent. Combined with mounting evidence of a relatively marked divergence between Neanderthals and modern humans, this has direct relevance for interpretations of the latter stages of hominid evolution. Because these hominids had slightly bigger brains than us, it is automatically assumed that they had comparable capacities. We should, however, consider the implications of the fact that brain expansion in Neanderthals was probably to some extent a parallel development. As part of a general recalibration of times of origin in the primate tree, the inferred time of origin of modern humans must also be pushed back in time, and this has implications for the spread of languages. Certain human features, including spoken language, are unique and there is no direct comparative evidence. Even here, however, comparisons can provide useful supporting information. Numerous explanations have been proposed to explain the three-fold expansion of human brain size in just a few million years, several involving the development of language, certain aspects of behavior linked to language or a combination thereof. In fact, appropriate analysis of brain size reveals that brain expansion (relative to body size) was already under way in australopithecines, so there is no temporal association with the first appearance of stone tools. Further, there is no convincing evidence for a direct link between overall brain size and any specific behavioral feature in primates generally, although individual parts of the brain may be linked to specific features. Here, brain evolution is explained in terms of a two-phase model in which the overall size of the brain is constrained by the resources provided by the mother (maternal energy hypothesis!, while the sizes of individual components may be subjected to selection. Possible evidence of specific selection is provided by a strong correlation between the size of the neocortex and group size, although the potential influence of confounding variables has yet to be fully explored. Hence, concatenation of this correlation with others to suggest that language evolved as an "inexpensive" substitute for social grooming because of the emergence of large group sizes in hominids must be treated with great caution.

In the presence of structural confounding, certain covariate strata will contain only subjects who could never be exposed, a violation of the positivity or experimental treatment effect assumption. Thus, structural confounding can prohibit the exchangeability necessary for meaningful causal contrasts across levels of exposure. The authors explored the presence and magnitude of structural confounding by estimating the independent effects of neighborhood deprivation and neighborhood racial composition (segregation) on rates of preterm birth in Wake and Durham counties, North Carolina (1999-2001). Tabular analyses and random-intercept fixed-slope multilevel logistic models portrayed different structural realities in these counties. The multilevel modeling results suggested some nonsignificant effect of residence in tracts with high levels of socioeconomic deprivation or racial residential segregation on adjusted odds of preterm birth for white and black women living in these counties, and the confidence limit ratios indicated fairly consistent levels of precision around the estimates. The results of the tabular analysis, however, suggested that many of these regression modeling findings were off-support and based on no actual data. The implications for statistical and public health inference, in the presence of no data, are considered.

Matched cohort and case-control study designs are commonly implemented to control for confounding effects without specifying the functional form of the relationship between the outcome and confounders. This paper extends the commonly used regression models in matched designs for binary and survival outcomes (i.e. conditional logistic and stratified Cox proportional hazards) to studies of continuous outcomes through a novel interpretation and application of logit-based regression models from the econometrics and marketing research literature. We compare the performance of the maximum likelihood estimators using simulated data and propose a heuristic argument for obtaining the residuals for model diagnostics. We illustrate our proposed approach with two real data applications. Our simulation studies demonstrate that our stratification approach is robust to model misspecification and that the distribution of the estimated residuals provides a useful diagnostic when the strata are of moderate size. In our applications to real data, we demonstrate that parity and menopausal status are associated with percent mammographic density, and that the mean level and variability of inpatient blood glucose readings vary between medical and surgical wards within a national tertiary hospital. Our work highlights how the same class of regression models, available in most statistical software, can be used to adjust for confounding in the study of binary, time-to-event and continuous outcomes.

We derive narrower bounds by adding assumptions regarding bias due to confounding. This bias is defined as the difference between the expectation of potential outcomes for the exposed group and that for the unexposed group. We show that crude effect measures bound causal effects under the given assumptions. We then derive bounds for randomized studies with noncompliance, which are given by the per protocol effect. With perfect compliance in one treatment group, the direction of effect becomes identifiable under our assumptions. Although the assumptions are not themselves identifiable, they are nonetheless reasonable in some situations. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Standard survival methods that incorporate time-varying confounders as covariates generally yield biased effect estimates. Estimators using weighting by inverse probability of exposure can be unstable when confounders are highly predictive of exposure or the exposure is continuous. Structural nested accelerated failure time models (AFTMs) require artificial recensoring, which can cause estimation difficulties. Here, we introduce the structural nested cumulative survival time model (SNCSTM). This model assumes that intervening to set exposure at time t to zero has an additive effect on the subsequent conditional hazard given exposure and confounder histories when all subsequent exposures have already been set to zero. We show how to fit it using standard software for generalized linear models and describe two more efficient, double robust, closed-form estimators. All three estimators avoid the artificial recensoring of AFTMs and the instability of estimators that use weighting by the inverse probability of exposure.

A central challenge of mediation analysis is justifying sufficient baseline covariates that meet the causal assumption of no unmeasured confounding. But current practices routinely overlook this assumption. In this article, we suggest a relatively easy way to mitigate the risks of incorrect inferences resulting from unmeasured confounding: include pretreatment measurements of the mediator(s) and the outcome as baseline covariates. We explain why adjusting for pretreatment baseline measurements is a necessary first step toward eliminating confounding biases. We hope that such a practice can encourage explication, justification, and reflection of the causal assumptions underpinning mediation analysis toward improving the validity of causal inferences in psychology research.

Specifically, we assume that omitted confounders could not change the odds of treatment for any unit by more than a fixed factor. We derive the sharp partial identification bounds implied by this assumption by leveraging distributionally robust optimization, and we propose estimators of these bounds with several novel robustness properties. The first is double sharpness: our estimators consistently estimate the sharp ATE bounds when one of two nuisance parameters is misspecified and achieve semiparametric efficiency when all nuisance parameters are suitably consistent. The second and more novel property is double validity: even when most nuisance parameters are misspecified, our estimators still provide valid but possibly conservative bounds for the ATE and our Wald confidence intervals remain valid even when our estimators are not asymptotically normal. As a result, our estimators provide a highly credible method for sensitivity analysis of causal inferences.

We propose a method to simultaneously address both issues in the form of a semi-parametric sensitivity analysis. In particular, our approach incorporates Bayesian Additive Regression Trees into a two-parameter sensitivity analysis strategy that assesses sensitivity of posterior distributions of treatment effects to choices of sensitivity parameters. This results in an easily interpretable framework for testing for the impact of an unmeasured confounder that also limits the number of modeling assumptions. We evaluate our approach in a large-scale simulation setting and with high blood pressure data taken from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The model is implemented as open-source software, integrated into the treatSens package for the R statistical programming language. (c) 2016 The Authors.

Instrumental variables as bias amplifiers with general outcome and confounding	BIOMETRIKA			English	Article						Causal inference; Directed acyclic graph; Interaction; Monotonicity; Potential outcome	PROPENSITY SCORE METHODS; CAUSAL; DISTRIBUTIONS; COLLAPSIBILITY; AMPLIFICATION; ASSOCIATION; BALANCE; BALLOON; DESIGN; MODELS	Drawing causal inference with observational studies is the central pillar of many disciplines. One sufficient condition for identifying the causal effect is that the treatment-outcome relationship is unconfounded conditional on the observed covariates. It is often believed that the more covariates we condition on, the more plausible this unconfoundedness assumption is. This belief has had a huge impact on practical causal inference, suggesting that we should adjust for all pretreatment covariates. However, when there is unmeasured confounding between the treatment and outcome, estimators adjusting for some pretreatment covariate might have greater bias than estimators that do not adjust for this covariate. This kind of covariate is called a bias amplifier, and includes instrumental variables that are independent of the confounder and affect the outcome only through the treatment. Previously, theoretical results for this phenomenon have been established only for linear models. We fill this gap in the literature by providing a general theory, showing that this phenomenon happens under a wide class of models satisfying certain monotonicity assumptions.

Nonparametric efficient causal mediation with intermediate confounders	BIOMETRIKA			English	Article						Intermediate confounder; Mediation analysis; Nonparametric efficiency; Targeted minimum loss-based estimator	EFFECT DECOMPOSITION; NATURAL DIRECT; REGRESSION; INFERENCE	Interventional effects for mediation analysis were proposed as a solution to the lack of identifiability of natural (in)direct effects in the presence of a mediator-outcome confounder affected by exposure. We present a theoretical and computational study of the properties of the interventional (in)direct effect estimands based on the efficient influence function in the nonparametric statistical model. We use the efficient influence function to develop two asymptotically optimal nonparametric estimators that leverage data-adaptive regression for the estimation of nuisance parameters: a one-step estimator and a targeted minimum loss estimator. We further present results establishing the conditions under which these estimators are consistent, multiply robust, n(1/2)-consistent and efficient. We illustrate the finite-sample performance of the estimators and corroborate our theoretical results in a simulation study. We also demonstrate the use of the estimators in our motivating application to elucidate the mechanisms behind the unintended harmful effects that a housing intervention had on risky behaviour in adolescent girls.

First, the phenomenon of "regularization-induced confounding" is introduced, which refers to the tendency of regularization priors to adversely bias treatment effect estimates by over-shrinking control variable regression coefficients. Then, a simultaneous regression model is presented which permits regularization priors to be specified in a way that avoids this unintentional "re-confounding". The new model is illustrated on synthetic and empirical data.	[Hahn, P.

J	Antonelli, J; Zigler, C; Dominici, F				Antonelli, Joseph; Zigler, Corwin; Dominici, Francesca			Guided Bayesian imputation to adjust for confounding when combining heterogeneous data sources in comparative effectiveness research	BIOSTATISTICS			English	Article						Bayesian data augmentation; Model averaging; Missing data; Bayesian adjustment for confounding; Confounder selection	SEER-MEDICARE DATA; PROPENSITY SCORE; MODEL SELECTION; VALIDATION DATA; REGRESSION; UNCERTAINTY; PARAMETERS; BINARY	In comparative effectiveness research, we are often interested in the estimation of an average causal effect from large observational data (the main study). Often this data does not measure all the necessary confounders. In many occasions, an extensive set of additional covariates is measured for a smaller and non-representative population (the validation study). In this setting, standard approaches for missing data imputation might not be adequate due to the large number of missing covariates in the main data relative to the smaller sample size of the validation data. We propose a Bayesian approach to estimate the average causal effect in the main study that borrows information from the validation study to improve confounding adjustment. Our approach combines ideas of Bayesian model averaging, confounder selection, and missing data imputation into a single framework. It allows for different treatment effects in the main study and in the validation study, and propagates the uncertainty due to the missing data imputation and confounder selection when estimating the average causal effect (ACE) in the main study. We compare our method to several existing approaches via simulation. We apply our method to a study examining the effect of surgical resection on survival among 10 396 Medicare beneficiaries with a brain tumor when additional covariate information is available on 2220 patients in SEER-Medicare. We find that the estimated ACE decreases by 30% when incorporating additional information from SEER-Medicare.

Naive regression requires weaker assumptions than factor models to adjust for multiple cause confounding	JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH			English	Article						causal inference; deconfounder; machine learning; unmeasured confounding	INFERENCE; BLESSINGS	The empirical practice of using factor models to adjust for shared, unobserved confounders, Z, in observational settings with multiple treatments, A, is widespread in fields including genetics, networks, medicine, and politics. Wang and Blei (2019, WB) generalize these procedures to develop the "deconfounder," a causal inference method using factor models of A to estimate "substitute confounders," Z, then estimating treatment effects-regressing the outcome, Y, on part of A while adjusting for Z. WB claim the deconfounder is unbiased when (among other assumptions) there are no single-cause confounders and Z is "pinpointed." We clarify pinpointing requires each confounder to affect infinitely many treatments. We prove that when the conditions hold for the deconfounder to be asymptotically unbiased, a naive semiparametric regression of Y on A which ignores confounding is also asymptotically unbiased. We provide bias formulas for finite numbers of treatments and show that different deconfounders exhibit different kinds of bias. We replicate every deconfounder analysis with available data and find that neither the naive regression nor the deconfounder consistently outperform the other. In practice, the deconfounder produces implausible estimates in WB's case study to movie earnings: estimates suggest comic author Stan Lee's cameo appearances causally contributed $15.5 billion, most of Marvel movie revenue. We conclude neither approach is a viable substitute for careful research design in real -world applications.

In Genome-Wide Association Interaction Studies (GWAIS), similar principles hold for pairs of causal variants. However, Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) may also interfere with the detection of genuine epistasis signals in that there may be complete confounding between Gametic Phase Disequilibrium (GPD) and interaction. GPD may involve unlinked genetic markers, even residing on different chromosomes. Often GPD is eliminated in GWAIS, via feature selection schemes or so-called pruning algorithms, to obtain unconfounded epistasis results. However, little is known about the optimal degree of GPD/LD-pruning that gives a balance between false positive control and sufficient power of epistasis detection statistics. Here, we focus on Model-Based Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction as one large-scale epistasis detection tool. Its performance has been thoroughly investigated in terms of false positive control and power, under a variety of scenarios involving different trait types and study designs, as well as error-free and noisy data, but never with respect to multicollinear SNPs.ResultsUsing real-life human LD patterns from a homogeneous subpopulation of British ancestry, we investigated the impact of LD-pruning on the statistical sensitivity of MB-MDR. We considered three different non-fully penetrant epistasis models with varying effect sizes. There is a clear advantage in pre-analysis pruning using sliding windows at r(2) of 0.75 or lower, but using a threshold of 0.20 has a detrimental effect on the power to detect a functional interactive SNP pair (power <25%). Signal sensitivity, directly using LD-block information to determine whether an epistasis signal is present or not, benefits from LD-pruning as well (average power across scenarios: 87%), but is largely hampered by functional loci residing at the boundaries of an LD-block.ConclusionsOur results confirm that LD patterns and the position of causal variants in LD blocks do have an impact on epistasis detection, and that pruning strategies and LD-blocks definitions combined need careful attention, if we wish to maximize the power of large-scale epistasis screenings.

J	Liu, FR; Chan, LW				Liu, Furui; Chan, Laiwan			Confounder Detection in High-Dimensional Linear Models Using First Moments of Spectral Measures	NEURAL COMPUTATION			English	Article							CAUSAL INFERENCE	In this letter, we study the confounder detection problem in the linear model, where the target variable Y is predicted using its n potential causes X-n = (x(1), . . . , x(n))(T). Based on an assumption of a rotation-invariant generating process of the model, recent study shows that the spectral measure induced by the regression coefficient vector with respect to the covariance matrix of X-n is close to a uniform measure in purely causal cases, but it differs from a uniform measure characteristically in the presence of a scalar confounder. Analyzing spectral measure patterns could help to detect confounding. In this letter, we propose to use the first moment of the spectral measure for confounder detection. We calculate the first moment of the regression vector-induced spectral measure and compare it with the first moment of a uniform spectral measure, both defined with respect to the covariance matrix of X-n. The two moments coincide in non-confounding cases and differ from each other in the presence of confounding. This statistical causal-confounding asymmetry can be used for confounder detection. Without the need to analyze the spectral measure pattern, our method avoids the difficulty of metric choice and multiple parameter optimization. Experiments on synthetic and real data show the performance of this method.

J	Lefebvre, G; Atherton, J; Talbot, D				Lefebvre, Genevieve; Atherton, Juli; Talbot, Denis			The effect of the prior distribution in the <i>Bayesian Adjustment for Confounding algorithm</i>	COMPUTATIONAL STATISTICS & DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						BACprior; Bayesian Adjustment for Confounding; Bayesian model averaging; Causal inference; Cross-validation; Prior distribution	UNCERTAINTY; MODEL; SELECTION; CRITERION	The effect of the prior distribution of the outcome and exposure models' covariate inclusion indicators in the Bayesian Adjustment for Confounding (BAC) algorithm is studied. The investigative approach is to analytically describe the posterior probabilities of the outcome models in terms of the integrated likelihoods for the outcome and exposure models. It is shown that BAC gives a posteriori progressively more weight to outcome models nesting all exposure models receiving non negligible support from the data as omega increases. Then, relying on the causal graphical framework and additional assumptions on the set of potential confounding covariates, further theoretical justifications for BAC are given. In particular, it is explained why outcome models nesting all likely exposure models are unbiased for the causal effect of exposure, and why favoring these outcome models in BAC increases the variance of the exposure effect estimator. Using the R package BACprior, the performance of two cross-validation procedures for selecting an omega value that minimizes the mean square error of the BAC exposure effect estimator is examined. A bootstrap procedure is subsequently studied. It is found that the performance of the resampling procedures examined is sensitive to the underlying data. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, with few exposed outcomes to inform covariate selection and many candidate confounders, optimal approaches to construct and implement propensity-score-based confounding adjustment remain unclear. Methods: In a cohort study on the effect of anticonvulsant drugs on cardiovascular risk among adult patients from the HealthCore Integrated Research Database, we compared the performance for confounding control of various covariate-selection strategies for propensity-score estimation (expert knowledge only, expert knowledge informed by empirical covariate selection via high-dimensional propensity-score, and high-dimensional propensity-score empirical specification only) and propensity-score-based adjustment methods (propensity-score-matching and propensity-score-decile stratification). This article focuses on the first 90 days of follow-up because any treatment effect identified in this temporal window almost certainty originates from residual confounding rather than pharmacologic action. Results: We identified 166,031 new users and 564 ischemic cardiovascular events. Among those, 12,580 patients initiated anticonvulsants that strongly induce cytochrome P450 enzymes and experienced 68 events. The unadjusted hazard ratio was 1.72 (95% confidence interval = 1.34-2.22). Adjustment for investigator-identified covariates led to 41% to 59% reductions in the hazard ratio; adjustment for both investigator-identified and high-dimensional propensity-score empirically identified covariates led to larger reductions (54% to 72%). A selection strategy based on high-dimensional propensity-score empirical specification alone produced less-attenuated and more-volatile hazard ratio estimates. This volatility seemed to be slightly attenuated in a trimmed propensity-score-stratified analysis. Conclusions: The high-dimensional propensity-score algorithm complements expert knowledge for confounding adjustment, but in settings with few exposed outcomes, its performance without investigator-specified covariates is less clear and may be associated with an increased likelihood of bias. In our example, investigator specification of variables combined with high-dimensional propensity-score empirical selection and the use of trimmed propensity-score-stratified analysis seem to improve effect estimation. Plotting the relation of effect estimates to the increasing number of empirical covariates is a useful diagnostic.

The authors simulated a cohort study and performed 252,480 trials. In the logistic regression, the bias decreased as the number of events per confounder increased. In the propensity score, the bias decreased as the strength of the association of the exposure with the outcome increased. Propensity scores produced estimates that were less biased, more robust, and more precise than the logistic regression estimates. when there were seven or fewer events per confounder. The logistic regression empirical coverage probability increased as the number of events per confounder increased. The propensity score empirical coverage probability decreased after eight or more events per confounder. Overall, the propensity score exhibited more empirical power than logistic regression. Propensity scores are a good alternative to control for imbalances when there are seven or fewer events per confounder; however, empirical power could range from 35% to 60%. Logistic regression is the technique of choice when there are at least eight events per confounder.

We describe a method that infers to what extent the statistical dependences between X and Y are due to the influence of X on Y and to what extent due to a hidden common cause (confounder) of X and Y. The method relies on concentration of measure results for large dimensions d and an independence assumption stating that, in the absence of confounding, the vector of regression coefficients describing the influence of each X on Y typically has 'generic orientation' relative to the eigenspaces of the covariance matrix of X. For the special case of a scalar confounder we show that confounding typically spoils this generic orientation in a characteristic way that can be used to quantitatively estimate the amount of confounding (subject to our idealized model assumptions).

While there are many models for individual preferences, existing learning methods overlook how choice set assignment affects the data. Often, the choice set itself is influenced by an individual's preferences; for instance, a consumer choosing a product from an online retailer is often presented with options from a recommender system that depend on information about the consumer's preferences. Ignoring these assignment mechanisms can mislead choice models into making biased estimates of preferences, a phenomenon that we call choice set confounding. We demonstrate the presence of such confounding in widely-used choice datasets. To address this issue, we adapt methods from causal inference to the discrete choice setting. We use covariates of the chooser for inverse probability weighting and/or regression controls, accurately recovering individual preferences in the presence of choice set confounding under certain assumptions. When such covariates are unavailable or inadequate, we develop methods that take advantage of structured choice set assignment to improve prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on real-world choice data, showing, for example, that accounting for choice set confounding makes choices observed in hotel booking and commute transportation more consistent with rational utility maximization.

Sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding in principal stratification settings with binary variables	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						causal; intermediate; principal stratification; confounding; observational; sensitivity analysis	INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES; BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; CAUSAL; IDENTIFICATION; OUTCOMES	Within causal inference, principal stratification (PS) is a popular approach for dealing with intermediate variables, that is, variables affected by treatment that also potentially affect the response. However, when there exists unmeasured confounding in the treatment armsas can happen in observational studiescausal estimands resulting from PS analyses can be biased. We identify the various pathways of confounding present in PS contexts and their effects for PS inference. We present model-based approaches for assessing the sensitivity of complier average causal effect estimates to unmeasured confounding in the setting of binary treatments, binary intermediate variables, and binary outcomes. These same approaches can be used to assess sensitivity to unknown direct effects of treatments on outcomes because, as we show, direct effects are operationally equivalent to one of the pathways of unmeasured confounding. We illustrate the methodology using a randomized study with artificially introduced confounding and a sensitivity analysis for an observational study of the effects of physical activity and body mass index on cardiovascular disease.

J	Paciorek, CJ				Paciorek, Christopher J.			The Importance of Scale for Spatial-Confounding Bias and Precision of Spatial Regression Estimators	STATISTICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Epidemiology; identifiability; mixed model; penalized likelihood; random effects; spatial correlation; splines	COMMUNITY AIR-POLLUTION; TIME-SERIES; MORTALITY; MODELS; DISEASE; EXPOSURE; HEALTH; COHORT	Residuals in regression models are often spatially correlated. Prominent examples include studies in environmental epidemiology to understand the chronic health effects of pollutants. I consider the effects of residual spatial structure on the bias and precision of regression coefficients, developing a simple framework in which to understand the key issues and derive informative analytic results. When unmeasured confounding introduces spatial structure into the residuals, regression models with spatial random effects and closely-related models such as kriging and penalized splines are biased, even when the residual variance components are known. Analytic and simulation results show how the bias depends on the spatial scales of the covariate and the residual: one can reduce bias by fitting a spatial model only when there is variation in the covariate at a scale smaller than the scale of the unmeasured confounding. I also discuss how the scales of the residual and the covariate affect efficiency and uncertainty estimation when the residuals are independent of the covariate. In an application on the association between black carbon particulate matter air pollution and birth weight, controlling for large-scale spatial variation appears to reduce bias from unmeasured confounders, while increasing uncertainty in the estimated pollution effect.

J	Best, N; Hansell, AL				Best, Nicky; Hansell, Anna Louise			Geographic Variations in Risk <i>Adjusting for Unmeasured Confounders Through joint Modeling of Multiple Diseases</i>	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY-DISEASE; MORTALITY; SMOKING; BRITAIN; ENGLAND; COPD	Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an important cause of mortality with marked geographic variations in Great Britain. Additional factors beyond cigarette smoking are likely to influence these variations, but direct information on smoking by area is not readily available. We compared methods of jointly modeling the spatial distribution of mortality from COPD and lung cancer, using the latter as a proxy for smoking, to identify areas in which risk factors other than smoking may be important. Methods: We obtained district-level mortality and population data for men aged 45 years or older in 1981-1999 in Great Britain. Three models were compared: Bayesian ecological regression using observed (model 1) or spatially smoothed (model 2) lung cancer standardized mortality ratio (SMR) as a smoking proxy, and bivariate regression (model 3) treating smoking as a spatial latent variable common to both diseases. Results: Model selection criteria favored models 2 and 3 over model 1. Between 9% (model 3) and 25% (model 2) of spatial variation in COPD mortality was estimated to be unrelated to smoking. After adjustment for lung cancer as a proxy for smoking, both models showed similar geographic patterns of higher COPD mortality in conurbation and mining areas, historically associated with heavy industry and higher air pollution levels. ' Conclusions: Joint modeling of multiple diseases can be used to investigate geographic variations in risk. These models reveal patterns that are adjusted for the effects of shared area-level risk factors for which no direct data are available.

The impact of confounder selection in propensity scores when applied to prospective cohort studies in pregnancy	REPRODUCTIVE TOXICOLOGY			English	Article						Inverse probability weighting; Regression adjustment; Standardization; Change in effects; p-value; Univariate association; Birth defects; Rare events; Average treatment effects	CAUSAL INFERENCE; REGRESSION; OUTCOMES; STRATEGIES	Our work was motivated by small cohort studies on the risk of birth defects in infants born to pregnant women exposed to medications. We controlled for confounding using propensity scores (PS). The extremely rare events setting renders the matching or stratification infeasible. In addition, the PS itself may be formed via different approaches to select confounders from a relatively long list of potential confounders. We carried out simulation experiments to compare different combinations of approaches: IPW or regression adjustment, with 1) including all potential confounders without selection, 2) selection based on univariate association between the candidate variable and the outcome, 3) selection based on change in effects (CIE). The simulation showed that IPW without selection leads to extremely large variances in the estimated odds ratio, which help to explain the empirical data analysis results that we had observed.

Under the unconfoundedness condition, adjustment for confounders requires estimating the nuisance functions relating outcome or treatment to confounders nonparametrically. This paper considers a generalized optimization framework for efficient estimation of general treatment effects using artificial neural networks (ANNs) to approximate the unknown nuisance function of growingdimensional confounders. We establish a new approximation error bound for the ANNs to the nuisance function belonging to a mixed smoothness class without a known sparsity structure. We show that the ANNs can alleviate the "curse of dimensionality" under this circumstance. We establish the root-n consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed general treatment effects estimators, and apply a weighted bootstrap procedure for conducting inference. The proposed methods are illustrated via simulation studies and a real data application.

The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Instrumental-variables regression; neighbourhoods; retail food environment; obesity; weight; endogeneity	OBESITY; DIET; INTERVENTION; SELECTION; ACCESS; HEALTH	Background: Findings in the observational retail food environment and obesity literature are inconsistent, potentially due to a lack of adjustment for residual confounding. Methods: Using data from the CARDIA study (n = 12 174 person-observations; 6 examinations; 1985-2011) across four US cities (Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis, MN; Oakland, CA), we used instrumental-variables (IV) regression to obtain causal estimates of the longitudinal associations between the percentage of neighbourhood food stores or restaurants (per total food outlets within 1 km network distance of respondent residence) with body mass index (BMI), adjusting for individual-level socio-demographics, health behaviours, city, year, total food outlets and market-level prices. To determine the presence and extent of bias, we compared the magnitude and direction of results with ordinary least squares (OLS) and random effects (RE) regression, which do not control for residual confounding, and with fixed effects (FE) regression, which does not control for time-varying residual confounding. Results: Relative to neighbourhood supermarkets (which tend to be larger and have healthier options than grocery stores), a higher percentage of grocery stores [mean=53.4%; standard deviation (SD) = 31.8%] was positively associated with BMI [beta = 0.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.01, 0.10] using IV regression. However, associations were negligible or null using OLS (beta = -0.001; 95% CI = -0.01, 0.01), RE (beta = -0.003; 95% CI = -0.01, 0.0001) and FE (beta = -0.003; 95% CI = -0.01, 0.0002) regression. Neighbourhood convenience stores and fast-food restaurants were not associated with BMI in any model. Conclusions: Longitudinal associations between neighbourhood food outlets and BMI were greater in magnitude using a causal model, suggesting that weak findings in the literature may be due to residual confounding.

Most existing methods rely on the assumption of no unmeasured confounding, which unfortunately cannot be ensured in practice especially in observational studies. Motivated by the recent proposed proximal causal inference, we develop several proximal learning approaches to estimating optimal individualized treatment regimes (ITRs) in the presence of unmeasured confounding. In particular, we establish several identification results for different classes of ITRs, exhibiting the trade-off between the risk of making untestable assumptions and the value function improvement in decision making. Based on these results, we propose several classification-based approaches to finding a variety of restricted in-class optimal ITRs and develop their theoretical properties. The appealing numerical performance of our proposed methods is demonstrated via an extensive simulation study and one real data application.

Diagnostics for confounding in PK/PD models for oxcarbazepine	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						pharmacokinetics; pharmacodynamics; pediatric bridging; potential outcomes; Rubin's causal model; sensitivity analysis; instrumental variables; two-stage least squares	CAUSAL; INFERENCE; SMOKING	One type of phannacokinetic/pharrnacodynarnic (PK/PD) relationship that is used to characterize the therapeutic action of a drug is the relationship between some univariate summary of the plasmaconcentration-versus-time profile and the drug effect on a response outcome. Operationally, such a relationship may be observed in a large clinical trial where randomly sampled patients are randomized to different values of the concentration summary. If, under such conditions, the relationship between concentration and effect does not depend on the dose needed to attain the target concentration, such a relationship will be called a true PK/PD relationship. When the true PK/PD relationship is assessed as an object of estimation in a dose-controlled clinical trial (i.e. when dose is randomized), observed drug concentration is an outcome variable. The estimated PK/PD relationship between observed outcome and observed concentration, which we then refer to as the conventional PK/PD relationship, may be biased for the true PK/PD relationship. Because of this bias, the conventional relationship is called confounded for the true one. We show that diagnostics for confounding can be devised under reasonable assumptions. We then apply these diagnostics to PK/PD assessments of adults and children on oxcarbazepine adjunctive therapy. It was necessary to demonstrate the similarity of the true PK/PD relationships of adults and children on adjunctive therapy in order to support the approval of oxcarbazepine monotherapy in children by a bridging argument.

J	McCandless, LC; Gustafson, P				McCandless, Lawrence C.; Gustafson, Paul			A comparison of Bayesian and Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Bayesian analysis; causal inference; non-identifiable model; sensitivity analysis	OBSERVATIONAL DATA; BIAS; BOUNDS; MODELS; RISK	Bias from unmeasured confounding is a persistent concern in observational studies, and sensitivity analysis has been proposed as a solution. In the recent years, probabilistic sensitivity analysis using either Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis (MCSA) or Bayesian sensitivity analysis (BSA) has emerged as a practical analytic strategy when there are multiple bias parameters inputs. BSA uses Bayes theorem to formally combine evidence from the prior distribution and the data. In contrast, MCSA samples bias parameters directly from the prior distribution. Intuitively, one would think that BSA and MCSA ought to give similar results. Both methods use similar models and the same (prior) probability distributions for the bias parameters. In this paper, we illustrate the surprising finding that BSA and MCSA can give very different results. Specifically, we demonstrate that MCSA can give inaccurate uncertainty assessments (e.g. 95% intervals) that do not reflect the data's influence on uncertainty about unmeasured confounding. Using a data example from epidemiology and simulation studies, we show that certain combinations of data and prior distributions can result in dramatic prior-to-posterior changes in uncertainty about the bias parameters. This occurs because the application of Bayes theorem in a non-identifiable model can sometimes rule out certain patterns of unmeasured confounding that are not compatible with the data. Consequently, the MCSA approach may give 95% intervals that are either too wide or too narrow and that do not have 95% frequentist coverage probability.

J	Connolly, EJ; Kavish, N				Connolly, Eric J.; Kavish, Nicholas			The Causal Relationship between Childhood Adversity and Developmental Trajectories of Delinquency: A Consideration of Genetic and Environmental Confounds	JOURNAL OF YOUTH AND ADOLESCENCE			English	Article						Childhood adversity; Delinquency; Siblings; Genetic; Environmental; NLSY97	POLY-VICTIMIZATION; COMMUNITY VIOLENCE; SELF-CONTROL; NATIONAL SAMPLE; EXPOSURE; RISK; EXPERIENCES; SYMPTOMS; CHILDREN; OVERLAP	An extensive line of research has found that children exposed to multiple forms of early life adversity are more likely to engage in high levels of delinquent behavior during adolescence. Several studies examining this association have used a range of multivariate statistical techniques capable of controlling for observable covariates. Fewer studies have used family-based research designs to additionally control for unobservable confounds, such as genetic and shared environmental influences, that may be associated with exposure to childhood adversity and delinquency. The current study analyzes self-report data on 2534 full-siblings (50% female) from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 to conduct a sibling-comparison analysis to provide a rigorous test of the causal hypothesis that exposure to childhood adversity causes differences in developmental patterns of delinquent behavior. Results from multivariate latent growth curve models revealed that childhood adversity was associated with higher starting levels of delinquency during adolescence and slower rates of decline from adolescence to emerging adulthood. Results from multivariate sibling-comparison models, however, revealed that siblings exposed to higher levels of childhood adversity reported higher starting levels of delinquent behavior, but not slower declines over time, suggesting that childhood adversity may not be directly associated with long-term patterns of delinquent behavior after genetic and shared environmental factors are taken into account. Implications of these results for future research are discussed.

We propose a simple and scalable estimator based on the projection onto the right singular vectors of the observed data matrix, which we call right singular vector projection (RSVP). Our theoretical analysis of this method reveals that, in contrast with approaches based on the removal of principal components, RSVP can cope well with settings where the smallest eigenvalue of Gamma T Gamma is relatively close to the largest eigenvalue of sigma, as well as when the eigenvalues of Gamma T Gamma are diverging fast. RSVP does not require knowledge or estimation of the number of latent factors q, but it recovers sigma only up to an unknown positive scale factor. We argue that this suffices in many applications, e.g. if an estimate of the correlation matrix is desired. We also show that, by using subsampling, we can further improve the performance of the method. We demonstrate the favourable performance of RSVP through simulation experiments and an analysis of gene expression data sets collated by the GTEX consortium.

How Do Unobserved Confounding Mediators and Measurement Error Impact Estimated Mediation Effects and Corresponding Statistical Inferences? Introducing the R Package ConMed for Sensitivity Analysis	PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS			English	Article						mediation model; posttreatment confounder; unobserved mediator; measurement error; sensitivity analysis; R package	CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSES; CAUSAL; BIAS; ROBUSTNESS; PRODUCT; IDENTIFICATION; QUANTIFY; LINK	Empirical studies often demonstrate multiple causal mechanisms potentially involving simultaneous or causally related mediators. However, researchers often use simple mediation models to understand the processes because they do not or cannot measure other theoretically relevant mediators. In such cases, another potentially relevant but unobserved mediator potentially confounds the observed mediator, thereby biasing the estimated direct and indirect effects associated with the observed mediator and threatening corresponding inferences. Additionally, researchers may not know the extent to which their measures are reliable, and accordingly, measurement error may bias estimated effects and mislead statistical inferences. Given these threats, we explore how the omission of an unobserved mediator and/or using variables with measurement error biases estimates and affects inferences associated with the observed mediator. Then, building off Frank's impact threshold for a confounding variable (ITCV), we propose a correlation-based sensitivity analysis. Lastly, we provide an R package ConMed to assess the robustness of mediation inferences given the omission of an unobserved, confounding mediator and/or measurement error.Translational Abstract Researchers across fields rely on mediation analyses to understand processes between the intervention and the outcome variable. Empirical studies regularly demonstrate the existence of multiple mediation pathways, such as through simultaneous or related mediators. However, many mediation analyses only include one mediator for various reasons and there are likely additional relevant mediators that could significantly bias estimates and inferences associated with the observed mediator. At the same time, valid statistical inferences also rely on the assumption that all the variables are measured without error, while researchers may not know the extent to which their measures are reliable. In practice, it is very likely that the omission of another confounding mediator and measurement error co-occurs. However, the extant literature on the combined effect of omitted confounders and measurement error does not evaluate cases where the confounder is a mediator; they focus on pretreatment confounders where the treatment has no impact on the omitted confounder. Therefore, we fill in the research gap by examining if/how omitting an alternative mediator and/or using variables with measurement error biases estimates and affects inferences associated with the observed mediator. We present analytical results as well as an illustrative example to demonstrate the potential consequences of omitting confounding mediator(s) given different reliability levels of observed variables. Additionally, we propose a correlation-based sensitivity analysis and provide an R package to help researchers assess the robustness of their mediation inferences given the omission of an unobserved, confounding mediator and/or measurement error.

Even in randomized studies the mediator may still be correlated with unobserved prognostic variables that affect the outcome, in which case the mediator's role in the causal process may not be inferred without bias. In the behavioural and social science literature very little attention has been given so far to the causal assumptions required for moderated mediation analysis. In this paper we focus on the index for moderated mediation, which measures by how much the mediated effect is larger or smaller for varying levels of the moderator. We show that in linear models this index can be estimated without bias in the presence of unmeasured common causes of the moderator, mediator and outcome under certain conditions. Importantly, one can thus use the test for moderated mediation to support evidence for mediation under less stringent confounding conditions. We illustrate our findings with data from a randomized experiment assessing the impact of being primed with social deception upon observer responses to others' pain, and from an observational study of individuals who ended a romantic relationship assessing the effect of attachment anxiety during the relationship on mental distress 2years after the break-up.

Possible explanations are their uncommon availability in classical statistical software or, when they are available, by the limitations related to multivariable modelling to take confounding into consideration. In this paper, we propose a strategy based on propensity scores that allows population causal effects to be estimated: the inverse probability weighting in the illness semi-Markov model with interval-censored data. Using simulated data, we validated the performances of the proposed approach. We also illustrated the usefulness of the method by an application aiming to evaluate the relationship between the inadequate size of an aortic bioprosthesis and its degeneration or/and patient death. We have updated the R package multistate to facilitate the future use of this method.

Estimating controlled direct effects in the presence of intermediate confounding of the mediator-outcome relationship: Comparison of five different methods	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Statistical models; confounding factor; causality; outcome assessments; bias	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; ASSUMPTION; DEFINITION	In mediation analysis between an exposure X and an outcome Y, estimation of the direct effect of X on Y by usual regression after adjustment for the mediator M may be biased if Z is a confounder between M and Y, and is also affected by X. Alternative methods have been described to avoid such a bias: inverse probability of treatment weighting with and without weight truncation, the sequential g-estimator and g-computation. Our aim was to compare the usual linear regression adjusted for M to these methods when estimating the controlled direct effect between X and Y in the causal structure and to explore the size of the potential bias. Estimations were computed in several simulated data sets as well as real data. We observed an increased bias of the controlled direct effect estimation using linear regression adjusted for M for larger effects of X on M and larger effects of Z on M. The sequential g-estimator and g-computation gave unbiased estimations with adequate coverage values in every situation studied. With continuous exposure X and mediator M, inverse probability of treatment weighting resulted in some bias and less satisfactory coverage for large effects of X on M and Z on M.

A Comparison of Methods to Estimate the Hazard Ratio Under Conditions of Time-varying Confounding and Nonpositivity	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							CAUSAL INFERENCE; MORTALITY; EXPOSURE; MODEL; SELECTION; SURVIVAL; BIAS	In occupational epidemiologic studies, the healthy worker survivor effect refers to a process that leads to bias in the estimates of an association between cumulative exposure and a health outcome. In these settings, work status acts both as an intermediate and confounding variable and may violate the positivity assumption (the presence of exposed and unexposed observations in all strata of the confounder). Using Monte Carlo simulation, we assessed the degree to which crude, work-status adjusted, and weighted (marginal structural) Cox proportional hazards models are biased in the presence of time-varying confounding and nonpositivity. We simulated the data representing time-varying occupational exposure, work status, and mortality. Bias, coverage, and root mean squared error (MSE) were calculated relative to the true marginal exposure effect in a range of scenarios. For a base-case scenario, using crude, adjusted, and weighted Cox models, respectively, the hazard ratio was biased downward 19%, 9%, and 6%; 95% confidence interval coverage was 48%, 85%, and 91%; and root MSE was 0.20, 0.13, and 0.11. Although marginal structural models were less biased in most scenarios studied, neither standard nor marginal structural Cox proportional hazards models fully resolve the bias encountered under conditions of time-varying confounding and nonpositivity.

This problem is paramount in medicine, where we would like to answer causal questions from large observational datasets like electronic health records (EHRs) and administrative claims. Modern medical data typically contain tens of thousands of covariates. Such a large set carries hope that many of the confounders are directly measured, and further hope that others are indirectly measured through their correlation with measured covariates. How can we exploit these large sets of covariates for causal inference? To help answer this question, this paper examines the performance of the large-scale propensity score (LSPS) approach on causal analysis of medical data. We demonstrate that LSPS may adjust for indirectly measured confounders by including tens of thousands of covariates that may be correlated with them. We present conditions under which LSPS removes bias due to indirectly measured confounders, and we show that LSPS may avoid bias when inadvertently adjusting for variables (like colliders) that otherwise can induce bias. We demonstrate the performance of LSPS with both simulated medical data and real medical data.

Confounder Adjustment Using the Disease Risk Score: A Proposal for Weighting Methods	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						causal inference; confounding; density; disease risk score; epidemiologic methods; weighting	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED PHASE-3; PROPENSITY-SCORE; CAUSAL INFERENCE; ORAL BG-12; STRATIFICATION; ROBUSTNESS; STRATEGIES; EXPOSURE; TRIAL	Propensity score analysis is a common approach to addressing confounding in nonrandomized studies. Its implementation, however, requires important assumptions (e.g., positivity). The disease risk score (DRS) is an alternative confounding score that can relax some of these assumptions. Like the propensity score, the DRS summarizes multiple confounders into a single score, on which conditioning by matching allows the estimation of causal effects. However, matching relies on arbitrary choices for pruning out data (e.g., matching ratio, algorithm, and caliper width) and may be computationally demanding. Alternatively, weighting methods, common in propensity score analysis, are easy to implement and may entail fewer choices, yet none have been developed for the DRS. Here we present 2 weighting approaches: One derives directly from inverse probability weighting; the other, named target distribution weighting, relates to importance sampling. We empirically show that inverse probability weighting and target distribution weighting display performance comparable to matching techniques in terms of bias but outperform them in terms of efficiency (mean squared error) and computational speed (up to >870 times faster in an illustrative study). We illustrate implementation of the methods in 2 case studies where we investigate placebo treatments for multiple sclerosis and administration of aspirin in stroke patients.

J	Hatami, R				Hatami, Rezvan			A practical method to control spatiotemporal confounding in environmental impact studies	METHODSX			English	Article						Spatiotemporal confounding; Natural variation; Structural equation modelling (SEM); Bayesian Networks (BNs)		Separating natural spatiotemporal variation from the impact of human activities has long been a challenge in environmental impact studies. To overcome this problem, a causal modelling method based on spatiotemporal data, integrated with existing statistical methods such as multivariate redundancy analysis, multiple regression and, ordination was used for inferring causal effects of wastewater on biotic ecosystems. The causal modelling techniques were structural equation modelling (SEM) and Bayesian Networks (BNs); SEM, with the help of statistical analysis, was used for building deterministic models while the composite hypothesis underlying the models was checked based on the principle of BNs. Both spatial and temporal variations were considered in the design of the study so that spatiotemporal confounding could be controlled by adjusting for 'time' and 'distance' in the models. This improved the external validity of the models, so they could be used for predicting the effect of interventions, e.g. manipulating the discharge loads. This could be possible where time-varying variables such as quantity of discharge effluent were included in the models. Models can be used for prediction the effect of an intervention in situations understood as causal. Thus, the causal structure of composite hypotheses of the study was tested using both local and global tests. (C) 2018 The Author. Published by Elsevier B.V.

J	Coffman, DL; Zhong, W				Coffman, Donna L.; Zhong, Wei			Assessing Mediation Using Marginal Structural Models in the Presence of Confounding and Moderation	PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS			English	Article						marginal structural model; inverse propensity weighting; mediation	KINDERGARTEN RETENTION POLICY; CAUSAL INFERENCE; PRINCIPAL STRATIFICATION; POTENTIAL OUTCOMES; PROPENSITY SCORE; IDENTIFICATION; BIAS; INTERVENTION; REGRESSION; TRIALS	This article presents marginal structural models with inverse propensity weighting (IPW) for assessing mediation. Generally, individuals are not randomly assigned to levels of the mediator. Therefore, confounders of the mediator and outcome may exist that limit causal inferences, a goal of mediation analysis. Either regression adjustment or IPW can be used to take confounding into account, but IPW has several advantages. Regression adjustment of even one confounder of the mediator and outcome that has been influenced by treatment results in biased estimates of the direct effect (i.e., the effect of treatment on the outcome that does not go through the mediator). One advantage of IPW is that it can properly adjust for this type of confounding, assuming there are no unmeasured confounders. Further, we illustrate that IPW estimation provides unbiased estimates of all effects when there is a baseline moderator variable that interacts with the treatment, when there is a baseline moderator variable that interacts with the mediator, and when the treatment interacts with the mediator. IPW estimation also provides unbiased estimates of all effects in the presence of nonrandomized treatments. In addition, for testing mediation we propose a test of the null hypothesis of no mediation. Finally, we illustrate this approach with an empirical data set in which the mediator is continuous, as is often the case in psychological research.

The amount of attenuation introduced in a given situation is not only a function of the precision of the exposure measurement but also depends on the conditional variance of the true exposure given the other independent variables. In addition, confounder effects may also be affected by the exposure measurement error. These difficulties in statistical model development are illustrated by examples from a epidemiological study performed in the Faroe Islands to investigate the adverse health effects of prenatal mercury exposure.

Confounding by Season in Ecologic Studies of Seasonal Exposures and Outcomes: Examples From Estimates of Mortality Due to Influenza	ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Seasons; Epidemiologic Methods; Models; Statistical; Influenza; Human	TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS; RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS; EXCESS HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS; UNITED-STATES; AIR-POLLUTION; PNEUMONIA; EPIDEMICS; IMPACT; DISEASE; MORBIDITY	PURPOSE: Many health outcomes exhibit seasonal variation in incidence, including accidents, suicides, and infections. For seasonal outcomes it can be difficult to distinguish the causal roles played by factors that also vary seasonally, such as weather, air pollution, and pathogen circulation. METHODS: Various approaches to estimating the association between a seasonal exposure and a seasonal outcome in ecologic Studies are reviewed, using studies of influenza-related mortality as an example. Because mortality rates vary seasonally and circulation of other respiratory viruses peaks during influenza season, it is a challenge to estimate which winter deaths were caused by influenza. Results of studies that estimated the contribution of influenza to all-cause mortality using different methods on the same data are compared. RESULTS: Methods for estimating associations between season exposures and outcomes vary greatly in their advantages, disadvantages, and assumptions. Even when applied to identical data, different methods can give greatly different results for the expected contribution of influenza to all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: When the association between exposures and outcomes that vary seasonally is estimated, models must be selected carefully, keeping in mind the assumptions inherent in each model.

Safety surveillance and the estimation of risk in select populations: Flexible methods to control for confounding while targeting marginal comparisons via standardization	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						causal inference; electronic health records; pharmacosurveillance; propensity score; rare adverse event	PROPENSITY SCORE METHODS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; ASYMPTOTIC VARIANCE; PERFORMANCE; MODELS	We consider the critical problem of pharmacosurveillance for adverse events once a drug or medical product is incorporated into routine clinical care. When making inference on comparative safety using large-scale electronic health records, we often encounter an extremely rare binary adverse outcome with a large number of potential confounders. In this context, it is challenging to offer flexible methods to adjust for high-dimensional confounders, whereas use of the propensity score (PS) can help address this challenge by providing both confounding control and dimension reduction. Among PS methods, regression adjustment using the PS as a covariate in an outcome model has been incompletely studied and potentially misused. Previous studies have suggested that simple linear adjustment may not provide sufficient control of confounding. Moreover, no formal representation of the statistical procedure and associated inference has been detailed. In this paper, we characterize a three-step procedure, which performs flexible regression adjustment of the estimated PS followed by standardization to estimate the causal effect in a select population. We also propose a simple variance estimation method for performing inference. Through a realistic simulation mimicking data from the Food and Drugs Administration's Sentinel Initiative comparing the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers on incidence of angioedema, we show that flexible regression on the PS resulted in less bias without loss of efficiency, and can outperform other methods when the PS model is correctly specified. In addition, the direct variance estimation method is a computationally fast and reliable approach for inference.

Sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding in a marginal structural Cox proportional hazards model	LIFETIME DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Sensitivity analysis; Selection bias; Unmeasured confounding	CAUSAL INFERENCE; LIFE EVENTS; SMOKING; EPIDEMIOLOGY; DEPRESSION; SYMPTOMS; EXPOSURE; PERIOD; BIASES; MEN	Sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding should be reported more often, especially in observational studies. In the standard Cox proportional hazards model, this requires substantial assumptions and can be computationally difficult. The marginal structural Cox proportional hazards model (Cox proportional hazards MSM) with inverse probability weighting has several advantages compared to the standard Cox model, including situations with only one assessment of exposure (point exposure) and time-independent confounders. We describe how simple computations provide sensitivity for unmeasured confounding in a Cox proportional hazards MSM with point exposure. This is achieved by translating the general framework for sensitivity analysis for MSMs by Robins and colleagues to survival time data. Instead of bias-corrected observations, we correct the hazard rate to adjust for a specified amount of unmeasured confounding. As an additional bonus, the Cox proportional hazards MSM is robust against bias from differential loss to follow-up. As an illustration, the Cox proportional hazards MSM was applied in a reanalysis of the association between smoking and depression in a population-based cohort of Norwegian adults. The association was moderately sensitive for unmeasured confounding.

When estimating the effect of a time-varying treatment or exposure on an outcome of interest measured at a later time, standard methods fail to give consistent estimators in the presence of time-varying confounders if those confounders are themselves affected by the treatment. Robins and colleagues have proposed several alternative methods that, provided certain assumptions hold, avoid the problems associated with standard approaches.

J	Lee, PH				Lee, Paul H.			Is a Cutoff of 10% Appropriate for the Change-in-Estimate Criterion of Confounder Identification?	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						causality; confounding factors; regression; simulation; statistical models	PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; SELECTION; HEALTH; DISEASE	Background: When using the change-in-estimate criterion, a cutoff of 10% is commonly used to identify confounders. However, the appropriateness of this cutoff has never been evaluated. This study investigated cutoffs required under different conditions. Methods: Four simulations were performed to select cutoffs that achieved a significance level of 5% and a power of 80%, using linear regression and logistic regression. A total of 10 000 simulations were run to obtain the percentage differences of the 4 fitted regression coefficients (with and without adjustment). Results: In linear regression, larger effect size, larger sample size, and lower standard deviation of the error term led to a lower cutoff point at a 5% significance level. In contrast, larger effect size and a lower exposure-confounder correlation led to a lower cutoff point at 80% power. In logistic regression, a lower odds ratio and larger sample size led to a lower cutoff point at a 5% significance level, while a lower odds ratio, larger sample size, and lower exposure-confounder correlation yielded a lower cutoff point at 80% power. Conclusions: Cutoff points for the change-in-estimate criterion varied according to the effect size of the exposure-outcome relationship, sample size, standard deviation of the regression error, and exposure-confounder correlation.

The problem of unmeasured confounding in settings with multiple treatments is most common in statistical genetics and bioinformatics settings, where researchers have developed many successful statistical strategies without engaging deeply with the causal aspects of the problem. Recently there have been a number of attempts to bridge the gap between these statistical approaches and causal inference, but these attempts have either been shown to be flawed or have relied on fully parametric assumptions. In this article, we propose two strategies for identifying and estimating causal effects of multiple treatments in the presence of unmeasured confounding. The auxiliary variables approach leverages variables that are not causally associated with the outcome; in the case of a univariate confounder, our method only requires one auxiliary variable, unlike existing instrumental variable methods that would require as many instruments as there are treatments. An alternative null treatments approach relies on the assumption that at least half of the confounded treatments have no causal effect on the outcome, but does not require a priori knowledge of which treatments are null. Our identification strategies do not impose parametric assumptions on the outcome model and do not rest on estimation of the confounder. This article extends and generalizes existing work on unmeasured confounding with a single treatment and models commonly used in bioinformatics. for this article are available online.

The meaning of confounding adjustment in the presence of multiple versions of treatment: an application to organ transplantation	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Compound treatments; Treatment versions; Transportability; Generalizability; Transplantation	LONG-TERM TREATMENT; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; LIVER; TOXICITY; DONORS	Causal inference for treatments with many versions requires a careful specification of the versions of treatment. Specifically, the existence of multiple relevant versions of treatment has implications for the selection of confounders. To illustrate this, we estimate the effect of organ transplantation using grafts from donors who died due to anoxic drug overdose, on recipient graft survival in the US. We describe how explicitly outlining the target trial (i.e. the hypothetical randomized trial which would answer the causal question of interest) to be emulated by an observational study analysis helps conceptualize treatment versions, guides selection of appropriate adjustment variables, and helps clarify the settings in which causal effects of compound treatments will be of value to decision-makers.

When a treatment is prescribed depending on the biomarker, confounding by indication might be introduced if the treatment modifies the marker profile and risk of failure. Objective Our aim was to highlight the flexibility of a two-stage model fitted within a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework. For this purpose, we monitored the prostate-specific antigens in prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiation therapy. In the presence of rising prostate-specific antigens after external beam radiation therapy, salvage hormone therapy can be prescribed to reduce both the prostate-specific antigens concentration and the risk of clinical failure, an illustration of confounding by indication. We focused on the assessment of the prognostic value of hormone therapy and prostate-specific antigens trajectory on the risk of failure. Methods We used a two-stage model within a Bayesian framework to assess the role of the prostate-specific antigens profile on clinical failure while accounting for a secondary treatment prescribed by indication. We modeled prostate-specific antigens using a hierarchical piecewise linear trajectory with a random changepoint. Residual prostate-specific antigens variability was expressed as a function of prostate-specific antigens concentration. Covariates in the survival model included hormone therapy, baseline characteristics, and individual predictions of the prostate-specific antigens nadir and timing and prostate-specific antigens slopes before and after the nadir as provided by the longitudinal process. Results We showed positive associations between an increased prostate-specific antigens nadir, an earlier changepoint and a steeper post-nadir slope with an increased risk of failure. Importantly, we highlighted a significant benefit of hormone therapy, an effect that was not observed when the prostate-specific antigens trajectory was not accounted for in the survival model. Conclusion Our modeling strategy was particularly flexible and accounted for multiple complex features of longitudinal and survival data, including the presence of a random changepoint and a time-dependent covariate.

Effect Decomposition in the Presence of an Exposure-Induced Mediator-Outcome Confounder	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							MODELS	Methods from causal mediation analysis have generalized the traditional approach to direct and indirect effects in the epidemiologic and social science literature by allowing for interaction and nonlinearities. However, the methods from the causal inference literature have themselves been subject to a major limitation, in that the so-called natural direct and indirect effects that are used are not identified from data whenever there is a mediator-outcome confounder that is also affected by the exposure. In this article, we describe three alternative approaches to effect decomposition that give quantities that can be interpreted as direct and indirect effects and that can be identified from data even in the presence of an exposure-induced mediator-outcome confounder. We describe a simple weighting-based estimation method for each of these three approaches, illustrated with data from perinatal epidemiology. The methods described here can shed insight into pathways and questions of mediation even when an exposure-induced mediator-outcome confounder is present.

Tchetgen			On semiparametric estimation of a path-specific effect in the presence of mediator-outcome confounding	BIOMETRIKA			English	Article						Causal inference; HIV/AIDS; Machine learning; Mediation; Multiple robustness; Unobserved confounding	CAUSAL; INFERENCE; MODELS	Path-specific effects constitute a broad class of mediated effects from an exposure to an outcome via one or more causal pathways along a set of intermediate variables. Most of the literature concerning estimation of mediated effects has focused on parametric models, with stringent assumptions regarding unmeasured confounding. We consider semiparametric inference of a path-specific effect when these assumptions are relaxed. In particular, we develop a suite of semiparametric estimators for the effect along a pathway through a mediator, but not through an exposure-induced confounder of that mediator. These estimators have different robustness properties, as each depends on different parts of the likelihood of the observed data. One estimator is locally semiparametric efficient and multiply robust. The latter property implies that machine learning can be used to estimate nuisance functions. We demonstrate these properties, as well as finite-sample properties of all the estimators, in a simulation study. We apply our method to an HIV study, in which we estimate the effect comparing two drug treatments on a patient's average log CD4 count mediated by the patient's level of adherence, but not by previous experience of toxicity, which is clearly affected by which treatment the patient is assigned to and may confound the effect of the patient's level of adherence on their virologic outcome.

Examining the Error of Mis-Specifying Nonlinear Confounding Effect With Application on Accelerometer-Measured Physical Activity	RESEARCH QUARTERLY FOR EXERCISE AND SPORT			English	Article						Causality; confounding factors; simulation; statistical models	MODEL FORM; ADJUST; TIME	Purpose: Some confounders are nonlinearly associated with dependent variables, but they are often adjusted using a linear term. The purpose of this study was to examine the error of mis-specifying the nonlinear confounding effect. Methods: We carried out a simulation study to investigate the effect of adjusting for a nonlinear confounder in the estimation of a causal relationship between the exposure and outcome in 3 ways: using a linear term, binning into 5 equal-size categories, or using a restricted cubic spline of the confounder. Continuous, binary, and survival outcomes were simulated. We examined the confounder across varying measurement error. In addition, we performed a real data analysis examining the 3 strategies to handle the nonlinear effects of accelerometer-measured physical activity in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2006 data. Results: The mis-specification of a nonlinear confounder had little impact on causal effect estimation for continuous outcomes. For binary and survival outcomes, this mis-specification introduced bias, which could be eliminated using spline adjustment only when there is small measurement error of the confounder. Real data analysis showed that the associations between high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes and mortality adjusted for physical activity with restricted cubic spline were about 3% to 11% larger than their counterparts adjusted with a linear term. Conclusion: For continuous outcomes, confounders with nonlinear effects can be adjusting with a linear term. Spline adjustment should be used for binary and survival outcomes on confounders with small measurement error.

James			Estimating the causal effect of treatment in observational studies with survival time end points and unmeasured confounding	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES C-APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Comparative effectiveness research; Instrumental variable; Observational study; Simultaneous equations model; Survival analysis	DATA TREATMENT MODELS; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; IDENTIFICATION; DISTRIBUTIONS; INFERENCE; VARIABLES; CANCER; BIAS; CARE	Estimation of the effect of a treatment in the presence of unmeasured confounding is a common objective in observational studies. The two-stage least squares instrumental variables procedure is frequently used but is not applicable to time-to-event data if some observations are censored. We develop a simultaneous equations model to account for unmeasured confounding of the effect of treatment on survival time subject to censoring. The identification of the treatment effect is assisted by instrumental variables (variables related to treatment but conditional on treatment, not to the outcome) and the assumed bivariate distribution underlying the data-generating process. The methodology is illustrated on data from an observational study of time to death following endovascular or open repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. As the instrumental variable and the distributional assumptions cannot be jointly assessed from the observed data, we evaluate the sensitivity of the results to these assumptions.

Confounding Adjustment in Comparative Effectiveness Research Conducted Within Distributed Research Networks	MEDICAL CARE			English	Article						comparative effectiveness research; distributed research network; confounding; propensity score; disease risk score; instrumental variable; marginal structural model; pharmacoepidemiology	DISEASE RISK SCORES; PROPENSITY SCORE; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES; CAUSAL INFERENCE; SAFETY SURVEILLANCE; OUTCOMES RESEARCH; HEALTH; MORTALITY; SELECTION	Background: A distributed research network (DRN) of electronic health care databases, in which data reside behind the firewall of each data partner, can support a wide range of comparative effectiveness research (CER) activities. An essential component of a fully functional DRN is the capability to perform robust statistical analyses to produce valid, actionable evidence without compromising patient privacy, data security, or proprietary interests. Objectives and Methods: We describe the strengths and limitations of different confounding adjustment approaches that can be considered in observational CER studies conducted within DRNs, and the theoretical and practical issues to consider when selecting among them in various study settings. Results: Several methods can be used to adjust for multiple confounders simultaneously, either as individual covariates or as confounder summary scores (eg, propensity scores and disease risk scores), including: (1) centralized analysis of patient-level data, (2) case-centered logistic regression of risk set data, (3) stratified or matched analysis of aggregated data, (4) distributed regression analysis, and (5) meta-analysis of site-specific effect estimates. These methods require different granularities of information be shared across sites and afford investigators different levels of analytic flexibility. Conclusions: DRNs are growing in use and sharing of highly detailed patient-level information is not always feasible in DRNs. Methods that incorporate confounder summary scores allow investigators to adjust for a large number of confounding factors without the need to transfer potentially identifiable information in DRNs. They have the potential to let investigators perform many analyses traditionally conducted through a centralized dataset with detailed patient-level information.

Its estimation is sensitive to common forms of time-dependent bias in the face of a time-dependent exposure. Predominant estimation approaches based on multistate modeling fail to fully eliminate such bias and, as a result, do not permit a causal interpretation, even in the absence of confounding. While recently proposed multistate modeling approaches can successfully eliminate residual time-dependent bias, and moreover succeed to adjust for time-dependent confounding by means of inverse probability of censoring weighting, inadequate application, and misinterpretation prevails in the medical literature. In this paper, we therefore revisit recent work on previously proposed PAF estimands and estimators in settings with time-dependent exposures and competing events and extend this work in several ways. First, we critically revisit the interpretation and applied terminology of these estimands. Second, we further formalize the assumptions under which a causally interpretable PAF estimand can be identified and provide analogous weighting-based representations of the identifying functionals of other proposed estimands. This representation aims to enhance the applied statistician's understanding of different sources of bias that may arise when the aim is to obtain a valid estimate of a causally interpretable PAF. To illustrate and compare these representations, we present a real-life application to observational data from the Ghent University Hospital ICUs to estimate the fraction of ICU deaths attributable to hospital-acquired infections.

Efforts to adjust for confounding by neighborhood using complex survey data	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						confounding; conditional logistic regression; generalized linear mixed models: misspecified mixing distribution; complex survey data: causal inference	LONGITUDINAL DATA; CLUSTERED DATA; MODELS; SELECTION	In social epidemiology, one often considers neighborhood or contextual effects on health outcomes, in addition to effects of individual exposures. This paper is concerned with the estimation of an individual exposure effect in the presence of confounding by neighborhood effects, motivated by an analysis of National health Interview Survey (NHIS) data. In the analysis, we operationalize neighborhood as the secondary sampling unit of the survey, which consists of small groups of neighboring census blocks. Thus the neighborhoods are sampled with unequal probabilities, as are individuals within neighborhoods. We develop and compare several approaches for the analysis of the effect of dichotomized individual-level education on the receipt of adequate mammography screening. In the analysis, neighborhood effects are likely to confound the individual effects, due to such factors as differential availability of health services and differential neighborhood culture. The approaches can be grouped into three broad classes: ordinary logistic regression for survey data, with either no effect or a fixed effect for each cluster; conditional logistic regression extended for survey data; and generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) regression for survey data. Standard use of GLMMs with small clusters fails to adjust for confounding by cluster (e.g. neighborhood); this motivated us to develop an adaptation. We use theory, simulation, and analyses of the NIIIS data to compare and contrast all of these methods. One conclusion is that all of the methods perform poorly when the sampling bias is strong; more research and new methods are clearly needed. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Effects of Omitting Non-confounding Predictors From General Relative-Risk Models for Binary Outcomes	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						bias; binary outcomes; general relative-risk model; generalized nonlinear model; logistic regression; omitted covariate	SELECTING CONTROLS; BREAST-CANCER; RADIATION; EFFICIENCY; COVARIATE; TIME	Background: The effects, in terms of bias and precision, of omitting non-confounding predictive covariates from generalized linear models have been well studied, and it is known that such omission results in attenuation bias but increased precision with logistic regression. However, many epidemiologic risk analyses utilize alternative models that are not based on a linear predictor, and the effect of omitting non-confounding predictive covariates from such models has not been characterized. Methods: We employed simulation to study the effects on risk estimation of omitting non-confounding predictive covariates from an excess relative risk (ERR) model and a general additive-multiplicative relative-risk mixture model for binary outcome data in a case-control setting. We also compared the results to the effects with ordinary logistic regression. Results: For these commonly employed alternative relative-risk models, the bias was similar to that with logistic regression when the risk was small. More generally, the bias and standard error of the risk-parameter estimates demonstrated patterns that are similar to those with logistic regression, but with greater magnitude depending on the true value of the risk. The magnitude of bias and standard error had little relation to study size or underlying disease prevalence. Conclusions: Prior conclusions regarding omitted covariates in logistic regression models can be qualitatively applied to the ERR and the general additive-multiplicative relative-risk mixture model without substantial change. Quantitatively, however, these alternative models may have slightly greater omitted-covariate bias, depending on the magnitude of the true risk being estimated.

We trained an autoencoder architecture to learn a lower-dimensional patient representation, which we used to compute PS. To compare the performance of an autoencoder-based PS with established methods, we performed a simulation study. We assessed the balancing and adjustment performance using standardized mean differences, root mean square errors (RMSE), percent bias, and confidence interval coverage. To illustrate the application of the autoencoder-based PS, we emulated the PRONOUNCE trial by applying the trial's protocol elements within an observational database setting, comparing two chemotherapy regimens. Results: All methods but the manual variable selection approach led to well-balanced cohorts with average standardized mean differences <0.1. LASSO yielded on average the lowest deviation of resulting estimates (RMSE 0.0205) followed by the autoencoder approach (RMSE 0.0248). Altering the hyperparameter setup in sensitivity analysis, the autoencoder approach led to similar results as LASSO (RMSE 0.0203 and 0.0205, respectively). In the case study, all methods provided a similar conclusion with point estimates clustered around the null (e.g., HRautoencoder 1.01 [95% confidence interval = 0.80, 1.27] vs. HRPRONOUNCE 1.07 [0.83, 1.36]). Conclusions: Autoencoder-based PS computation was a feasible approach to control for confounding but did not perform better than some established approaches like LASSO.

Tchetgen			A class of semiparametric tests of treatment effect robust to confounder measurement error	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						causal inference; climate change; double robustness; environmental health; measurement error; semiparametric inference	AIR-POLLUTION; MORTALITY; BIAS; ASSOCIATION	When assessing the presence of an exposure causal effect on a given outcome, measurement error of a confounder can inflate the type I error rate of a treatment effect in even the simplest of settings. In this paper, we develop a large class of semiparametric test statistics of an exposure causal effect, which are completely robust to additive unbiased measurement error of a subset of confounders. A unique and appealing feature of our proposed methodology is that it requires no external information such as validation data or replicates of error-prone confounders. We present a doubly robust form of this test that requires the exposure mean model to be linear in the mismeasured confounders, and only one of two models involving error-free confounders to be correctly specified for the resulting test statistic to have correct type I error rate. We demonstrate validity within our class of test statistics through simulation studies. We apply the methods to a multi-US-city time-series data set to test for an effect of temperature on mortality while adjusting for atmospheric particulate matter with diameter of 2.5 micrometres or less, which is known to be measured with error.

We focus on applications where unobserved variables are known to have a widespread effect on many of the observed ones, which makes the problem particularly difficult for constraint-based methods, because most pairs of variables are conditionally dependent given any other subset, rendering the causal effect unidentifiable. In this article, we show that under the principle of independent mechanisms, unobserved confounding in this setting leaves a statistical footprint in the observed data distribution that allows for disentangling spurious and causal effects. Using this insight, we demonstrate that a sparse linear Gaussian directed acyclic graph (DAG) among observed variables may be recovered approximately and propose a simple adjusted score-based causal discovery algorithm that may be implemented with general-purpose solvers and scales to high-dimensional problems. We find, in addition, that despite the conditions we pose to guarantee causal recovery, performance in practice is robust to large deviations in model assumptions, and extensions to nonlinear structural models are possible.

J	Gustafson, P; Greenland, S				Gustafson, Paul; Greenland, Sander			The performance of random coefficient regression in accounting for residual confounding	BIOMETRICS			English	Article						Bayesian analysis; bias; confounding; epidemiology; hierarchical models; identifiability; mixed models; observational studies; random coefficient regression	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; PRIOR INFORMATION; PREVALENCE; ABSENCE; IDENTIFIABILITY; PRIORS; TESTS	Greenland (2000, Biometrics 56, 915-921) describes the use of random coefficient regression to adjust for residual confounding in a particular setting. We examine this setting further, giving theoretical and empirical results concerning the frequentist and Bayesian performance of random coefficient regression. Particularly, we compare estimators based on this adjustment for residual confounding to estimators based on the assumption of no residual confounding. This devolves to comparing an estimator from a nonidentified but more realistic model to an estimator from a less realistic but identified model. The approach described by Gustafson (2005, Statistical Science 20, 111-140) is used to quantify the performance of a Bayesian estimator arising from a nonidentified model. From both theoretical calculations and simulations we find support for the idea that superior performance can be obtained by replacing unrealistic identifying constraints with priors that allow modest departures from those constraints. In terms of point-estimator bias this superiority arises when the extent of residual confounding is substantial, but the advantage is much broader in terms of interval estimation. The benefit from modeling residual confounding is maintained when the prior distributions employed only roughly correspond to reality, for the standard identifying constraints are equivalent to priors that typically correspond much worse.

J	Frank, KA				Frank, KA			Impact of a confounding variable on a regression coefficient	SOCIOLOGICAL METHODS & RESEARCH			English	Review							STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE; CAUSAL INFERENCE; SOCIOECONOMIC ACHIEVEMENT; UNITED-STATES; HIGH-SCHOOL; PSYCHOLOGY; MODELS; TESTS	Regression coefficients cannot be interpreted as causal if the relationship can be attributed to an alternate mechanism. One may control for the alternate cause through an experiment(e.g., with random assignment to treatment and control) or by measuring a corresponding confounding variable and including it in the model. Unfortunately, there are some circumstances under which it is not possible to measure or control for the potentially confounding variable. Under these circumstances, it is helpful to assess the robustness of a statistical inference to the inclusion of a potentially confounding variable. In this article, an index is derived for quantifying the impact of a confounding variable on the inference of a regression coefficient. The index is developed for the bivariate care and then generalized to the multivariate case, and the distribution of the index is discussed. The index also is compared with existing indexes and procedures. An example is presented for the relationship between socioeconomic background and educational attainment, and a reference distribution for the index is obtained. The potential for the index to inform causal inferences is discussed as are extensions.

The impact of unmeasured within- and between-cluster confounding on the bias of effect estimatorsof a continuous exposure	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Bias formula; causal inference; instrumental variables; linear mixed model; observational study; unmeasured confounders	DIALYSIS OUTCOMES; PRACTICE PATTERNS; WEAK INSTRUMENTS; ANEMIA; IDENTIFICATION; PREFERENCE	Unmeasured confounding almost always exists in observational studies and can bias estimates of exposure effects. Instrumental variable methods are popular choices in combating unmeasured confounding to obtain less biased effect estimates. However, we demonstrate that alternative methods may give less biased estimates depending on the nature of unmeasured confounding. Treatment preferences of clusters (e.g. physician practices) are the most frequently used instruments in instrumental variable analyses. These preference-based instrumental variable analyses are usually conducted on data clustered by region, hospital/facility, or physician, where unmeasured confounding often occurs within or between clusters. We aim to quantify the impact of unmeasured confounding on the bias of effect estimators in instrumental variable analysis, as well as several common alternative methods including ordinary least squares regression, linear mixed models, and fixed-effect models to study the effect of a continuous exposure (e.g. treatment dose) on a continuous outcome. We derive closed-form expressions of asymptotic bias of estimators from these four methods in the presence of unmeasured within- and/or between-cluster confounders. Simulations demonstrate that the asymptotic bias formulae well approximate bias in finite samples for all methods. The bias formulae show that instrumental variable analyses can provide consistent estimates when unmeasured within-cluster confounding exists, but not when between-cluster confounding exists. On the other hand, fixed-effect models and linear mixed models can provide consistent estimates when unmeasured between-cluster confounding exits, but not for within-cluster confounding. Whether instrumental variable analyses are advantageous in reducing bias over fixed-effect models and linear mixed models depends on the extent of unmeasured within-cluster confounding relative to between-cluster confounding. Furthermore, the impact of unmeasured between-cluster confounding on instrumental variable analysis estimates is larger than the impact of unmeasured within-cluster confounding on fixed-effect model and linear mixed model estimates. We illustrate the use of these methods in estimating the effect of erythropoiesis stimulating agents on hemoglobin levels. Our findings provide guidance for choosing appropriate methods to combat the dominant types of unmeasured confounders and help interpret statistical results in the context of unmeasured confounding.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS FOR UNMEASURED CONFOUNDING IN COARSE STRUCTURAL NESTED MEAN MODELS	STATISTICA SINICA			English	Article						Censoring; confounding by indication; estimating equations; HIV/AIDS research; non-ignorable; sequential randomization	MISSING DATA; NONCOMPLIANCE; MORTALITY; INFECTION; INFERENCE; THERAPY; IMPACT; TRIALS; TIME; BIAS	Coarse Structural Nested Mean Models (SNMMs, Robins (2000)) and G-estimation can be used to estimate the causal effect of a time-varying treatment from longitudinal observational studies. However, they rely on an untestable assumption of no unmeasured confounding. In the presence of unmeasured confounders, the unobserved potential outcomes are not missing at random, and standard G-estimation leads to biased effect estimates. To remedy this, we investigate the sensitivity of G-estimators of coarse SNMMs to unmeasured confounding, assuming a nonidentifiable bias function which quantifies the impact of unmeasured confounding on the average potential outcome. We present adjusted G-estimators of coarse SNMM parameters and prove their consistency, under the bias modeling for unmeasured confounding. We present a sensitivity analysis for the effect of the ART initiation time on the mean CD4 count at year 2 after infection in HIV-positive patients, based on the prospective Acute and Early Disease Research Program.

J	Wolf, LJ				Wolf, Levi John			Confounded Local Inference: Extending Local Moran Statistics to Handle Confounding	ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS			English	Article; Early Access						causal inference; confounding; local statistics; spatial analysis; spatial data science	SPATIAL ASSOCIATION; MODELS; UK	Local statistical analysis has long been of interest to social and environmental scientists who analyze geographic data. Research into local spatial statistics experienced a step-change in the mid-1990s, which provided a large class of local statistical methods and models. The local Moran statistic is one commonly used local indicator of spatial association, able to detect both areas of similarity and observations that are very dissimilar from their surroundings. From this, many further local statistics have been developed to characterize spatial clusters and outliers. These statistics have seen limited adoption because they do not sufficiently model the relationships involved in confounded spatial data, where the analyst seeks to understand the local spatial structure of a given outcome variable that is influenced by one or more additional factors. Recent innovations used to do joint multivariate local analysis also do not model this kind of conditional local structure in data. This article provides tools to rigorously characterize confounded local inference and a new and different class of multivariate conditional local Moran statistics that can account for confounding. To do this, we return to the Moran scatterplot as the critical tool for local Moran-style covariance statistics. Extending this concept, a new method is available directly from a "Moran-form" multiple regression. We show the empirical and theoretical properties of this statistic, show how some existing heuristic approaches arise naturally from this framework, and show how the use of conditional inference can change interpretations in an empirical analysis of rent and housing stock in a rapidly changing neighborhood.

J	Wodtke, GT; Alaca, Z; Zhou, X				Wodtke, Geoffrey T.; Alaca, Zahide; Zhou, Xiang			Regression-with-residuals estimation of marginal effects: a method of adjusting for treatment-induced confounders that may also be effect modifiers	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY			English	Article						g-estimation; Inverse probability of treatment weighting; Marginal structural models; Regression with residuals; Structural nested mean models; Treatment-induced confounding	NESTED MEAN MODELS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; CONCENTRATED DISADVANTAGE; STRUCTURAL MODELS; EXPOSURE; NEIGHBORHOODS; STATISTICS; BIAS	When making causal inferences, treatment-induced confounders complicate analyses of time-varying treatment effects. Conditioning on these variables naively to estimate marginal effects may inappropriately block causal pathways and may induce spurious associations between the treatment and the outcome, leading to bias. Although several methods for estimating marginal effects avoid these complications, including inverse probability of treatment weighted estimation of marginal structural models as well as g- and regression-with-residuals estimation of highly constrained structural nested mean models, each suffers from a set of non-trivial limitations, among them an inability to accommodate effect modification. In this study, we adapt the method of regression with residuals to estimate marginal effects with a set of moderately constrained structural nested mean models that easily accommodate several types of treatment-by-confounder interaction. With this approach, the confounders at each time point are first residualized with respect to the observed past, which involves centring them at their estimated means given prior treatments and confounders. The outcome is then regressed on all prior variables, including a set of treatment-by-confounder interaction terms, with these residuals substituted for the untransformed confounders both as 'main effects' and as part of any interaction terms. Through a series of simulation experiments and empirical examples, we show that this approach outperforms other methods for estimating the marginal effects of time-varying treatments.

J	Wodtke, GT; Alaca, Z; Zhou, X				Wodtke, Geoffrey T.; Alaca, Zahide; Zhou, Xiang			Regression-with-residuals estimation of marginal effects: a method of adjusting for treatment-induced confounders that may also be effect modifiers	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY			English	Article; Early Access						g-estimation; Inverse probability of treatment weighting; Marginal structural models; Regression with residuals; Structural nested mean models; Treatment-induced confounding	NESTED MEAN MODELS; CONCENTRATED DISADVANTAGE; STRUCTURAL MODELS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; EXPOSURE; NEIGHBORHOODS; STATISTICS; BIAS	When making causal inferences, treatment-induced confounders complicate analyses of time-varying treatment effects. Conditioning on these variables naively to estimate marginal effects may inappropriately block causal pathways and may induce spurious associations between the treatment and the outcome, leading to bias. Although several methods for estimating marginal effects avoid these complications, including inverse probability of treatment weighted estimation of marginal structural models as well as g- and regression-with-residuals estimation of highly constrained structural nested mean models, each suffers from a set of non-trivial limitations, among them an inability to accommodate effect modification. In this study, we adapt the method of regression with residuals to estimate marginal effects with a set of moderately constrained structural nested mean models that easily accommodate several types of treatment-by-confounder interaction. With this approach, the confounders at each time point are first residualized with respect to the observed past, which involves centring them at their estimated means given prior treatments and confounders. The outcome is then regressed on all prior variables, including a set of treatment-by-confounder interaction terms, with these residuals substituted for the untransformed confounders both as 'main effects' and as part of any interaction terms. Through a series of simulation experiments and empirical examples, we show that this approach outperforms other methods for estimating the marginal effects of time-varying treatments.

We demonstrate how prior knowledge unique to the multi-outcome setting can be leveraged to strengthen causal conclusions beyond what can be achieved from analyzing individual outcomes in isolation. We argue that it is often reasonable to make a shared confounding assumption, under which residual dependence amongst outcomes can be used to simplify and sharpen sensitivity analyses. We focus on a class of factor models for which we can bound the causal effects for all outcomes conditional on a single sensitivity parameter that represents the fraction of treatment variance explained by unobserved confounders. We characterize how causal ignorance regions shrink under additional prior assumptions about the presence of null control outcomes, and provide new approaches for quantifying the robustness of causal effect estimates. Finally, we illustrate our sensitivity analysis workflow in practice, in an analysis of both simulated data and a case study with data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

Propensity score methods for time-dependent cluster confounding	BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						clustering; matching; observational study; propensity score; survival analysis	CAUSAL INFERENCE; MODELS	In observational studies, subjects are often nested within clusters. In medical studies, patients are often treated by doctors and therefore patients are regarded as nested or clustered within doctors. A concern that arises with clustered data is that cluster-level characteristics (e.g., characteristics of the doctor) are associated with both treatment selection and patient outcomes, resulting in cluster-level confounding. Measuring and modeling cluster attributes can be difficult and statistical methods exist to control for all unmeasured cluster characteristics. An assumption of these methods however is that characteristics of the cluster and the effects of those characteristics on the outcome (as well as probability of treatment assignment when using covariate balancing methods) are constant over time. In this paper, we consider methods that relax this assumption and allow for estimation of treatment effects in the presence of unmeasured time-dependent cluster confounding. The methods are based on matching with the propensity score and incorporate unmeasured time-specific cluster effects by performing matching within clusters or using fixed- or random-cluster effects in the propensity score model. The methods are illustrated using data to compare the effectiveness of two total hip devices with respect to survival of the device and a simulation study is performed that compares the proposed methods. One method that was found to perform well is matching within surgeon clusters partitioned by time. Considerations in implementing the proposed methods are discussed.

The problem of assessing the adequacy of model fit when the expectations are small is addressed by analytical calculations and by simulation. The method is illustrated with data from the national register of childhood tumours. Design - The tumour data are recorded in a national register. Setting - England, Scotland, and Wales. Subjects - The cases considered are all children registered with leukaemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma under the age of 15 years between 1966-87. Main results - The methods show a significant variation of leukaemia incidence in relation to the Registrar General's standard region and a negative association with socioeconomic deprivation, as measured by the Townsend index. After allowing for these variables, the incidence seems to be reasonably homogeneous throughout the population, in the sense that the residual deviance does not seem to be much larger than would be expected by chance. Conclusions - The methods described have major advantages over standardisation in controlling for confounding, both in terms of flexibility of factor selection and assessment and also in the ability to determine whether there is residual variability of incidence after allowing for these factors.

The proposed method assumes that the true exposure effect can be represented in a regression model that includes the exposure indicator as well as the measured and unmeasured confounders. One can use the corresponding reduced model that omits the unmeasured confounder to make statistical inferences about the true exposure effect by specifying the distributions of the unmeasured confounder in the exposed and unexposed groups along with the effects of the unmeasured confounder on the outcome variable. Under certain conditions, there exists a simple algebraic relationship between the true exposure effect in the full model and the apparent exposure effect in the reduced model. One can then estimate the true exposure effect by making a simple adjustment to the point and interval estimates of the apparent exposure effect obtained from standard software or published reports. The proposed method handles both binary response and censored survival time data, accommodates any study design, and allows the unmeasured confounder to be discrete or normally distributed. We describe applications to two major medical studies.

Confounding by Dietary Patterns of the Inverse Association Between Alcohol Consumption and Type 2 Diabetes Risk	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						alcohol drinking; bias (epidemiology); confounding factors (epidemiology); diabetes mellitus; type 2; diet; factor analysis; statistical; least-squares analysis; proportional hazards models	PROPENSITY SCORE; DRINKING PATTERNS; HEART-DISEASE; VALIDITY; REPRODUCIBILITY; MELLITUS; BIAS	The ability to interpret epidemiologic observations is limited because of potential residual confounding by correlated dietary components. Dietary pattern analyses by factor analysis or partial least squares may overcome the limitation. To examine confounding by dietary pattern as well as standard risk factors and selected nutrients, the authors modeled the longitudinal association between alcohol consumption and 7-year risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in 2,879 healthy adults enrolled in the Framingham Offspring Study (1991-2001) by Cox proportional hazard models. After adjustment for standard risk factors, consumers of >= 9.0 drinks/week had a significantly lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with abstainers (hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.27, 0.81). Adjustment for selected nutrients had little effect on the hazard ratio, whereas adjustment for dietary pattern variables by factor analysis significantly shifted the hazard ratio away from null (hazard ratio = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.64) by 40.0% (95% CI: 16.8, 57.0; P = 0.002). Dietary pattern variables by partial least squares showed similar results. Therefore, the observed inverse association, consistent with past studies, was confounded by dietary patterns, and this confounding was not captured by individual nutrient adjustment. The data suggest that alcohol intake, not dietary patterns associated with alcohol intake, is responsible for the observed inverse association with type 2 diabetes mellitus risk.

Omitted Variable Bias: Examining Management Research With the Impact Threshold of a Confounding Variable (ITCV)	JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT			English	Article						omitted variables; endogeneity; impact threshold of a confounding variable; instrumental variable modeling; simulations		Management research increasingly recognizes omitted variables as a primary source of endogeneity that can induce bias in empirical estimation. Methodological scholarship on the topic overwhelmingly advocates for empirical researchers to employ two-stage instrumental variable modeling, a recommendation we approach with trepidation given the challenges associated with this analytic procedure. Over the course of two studies, we leverage a statistical technique called the impact threshold of a confounding variable (ITCV) to better conceptualize what types of omitted variables might actually bias causal inference and whether they have appeared to do so in published management research. In Study 1, we apply the ITCV to published studies and find that a majority of the causal inference is unlikely biased from omitted variables. In Study 2, we respecify an influential simulation on endogeneity and determine that only the most pervasive omitted variables appear to substantively impact causal inference. Our simulation also reveals that only the strongest instruments (perhaps unrealistically strong) attenuate bias in meaningful ways. Taken together, we offer guidelines for how scholars can conceptualize omitted variables in their research, provide a practical approach that balances the tradeoffs associated with instrumental variable models, and comprehensively describe how to implement the ITCV technique.

Use of instrumental variables in the analysis of generalized linear models in the presence of unmeasured confounding with applications to epidemiological research	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						instrumental variables analysis; generalized linear models; epidemiology generalized method of moments; unmeasured confounding	HEART-FAILURE; MANAGEMENT; MOMENTS; GUIDELINES; MORTALITY; DISEASE	A major, often unstated, concern of researchers carrying out epidemiological studies of medical therapy is the potential impact on validity if estimates of treatment are biased due to unmeasured confounders. One technique for obtaining consistent estimates of treatment effects in the presence of unmeasured confounders is instrumental variables analysis (IVA). This technique has been well developed in the econometrics literature and is being increasingly used in epidemiological studies. However, the approach to IVA that is most commonly used in such studies is based on linear models, while many epidemiological applications make use of non-linear models, specifically generalized linear models (GLMs) such as logistic or Poisson regression. Here we present a simple method for applying IVA within the class of GLMs using the generalized method of moments approach. We explore some of the theoretical properties of the method and illustrate its use within both a simulation example and an epidemiological study where unmeasured confounding is suspected to be present. We estimate the effects of beta-blocker therapy on one-year all-cause mortality after an incident hospitalization for heart failure, in the absence of data describing disease severity, which is believed to be a confounder.

However, this framework is not insulated from spatial confounding, a topic of significant interest in cancer epidemiology, where the latent correlation between the spatial random effects and fixed effects (such as covariates), often lead to misleading interpretation. Aims To introduce three popular approaches (RHZ,HHandSPOCK; details in paper) often employed to tackle spatial confounding, and illustrate their implementation in cancer research via the popular statistical softwareR. Methods As a solution to alleviate spatial confounding, restricted spatial regressions are constructed by either projecting the latent effect onto the orthogonal space of covariates, or by displacing the spatial locations. Popular parametric count data models, such as the Poisson, generalized Poisson and negative binomial, were considered for the areal count responses, while the spatial association is quantified via the conditional autoregressive (CAR) model. Our method of inference in Bayesian, sometimes aided by the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) to accelerate computing. The methods are implemented in theRpackageRASCOavailable from the first author'sGitHubpage. Results The results reveal that all three methods perform well in alleviating the bias and variance inflation present in the spatial models. The effects of spatial confounding were also explored, which, if ignored in practice, may lead to wrong conclusions. Conclusion Spatial confounding continues to remain a critical bottleneck in deriving precise inference from spatial DM models. Hence, its effects must be investigated, and mitigated. Several approaches are available in the literature, and they produce trustworthy results. The central contribution of this paper is providing the practitioners theRpackageRASCO, capable of fitting a large number of spatial models, as well as their restricted versions.	[Azevedo, Douglas R.

The optimal strategy for evaluating a disease risk score (DRS) model's ability to control confounding is less clear. DRS models cannot be evaluated through balance checks within the full population, and they are usually assessed through prediction diagnostics and goodness-of-fit tests. A proposed alternative is the "dry-run" analysis, which divides the unexposed population into "pseudo-exposed" and "pseudo-unexposed" groups so that differences on observed covariates resemble differences between the actual exposed and unexposed populations. With no exposure effect separating the pseudo-exposed and pseudo-unexposed groups, a DRS model is evaluated by its ability to retrieve an unconfounded null estimate after adjustment in this pseudo-population. We used simulations and an empirical example to compare traditional DRS performance metrics with the dry-run validation. In simulations, the dry run often improved assessment of confounding control, compared with the C statistic and goodness-of-fit tests. In the empirical example, PS and DRS matching gave similar results and showed good performance in terms of covariate balance (PS matching) and controlling confounding in the dry-run analysis (DRS matching). The dry-run analysis may prove useful in evaluating confounding control through DRS models.

The data source and analytical opportunities for study create risks that can lead to misinterpretation or bias the results. This review serves as an introduction to the concept of bias and confounding to help researchers conduct methodologically sound pharmacoepidemiologic research projects using administrative databases. Beyond general considerations for observational study, there are several unique issues related to database research that should be addressed. The risks of uninterpretable or biased results can be minimized by: providing a robust description of the data tables used; focusing on why and how they were created; measuring and reporting the accuracy of diagnostic and procedural codes used; and properly accounting for any time-dependent nature of variables. The hallmark of good research is rigorously careful analysis and interpretation. The promise for value of real world evidence using databases in medical decision making must be balanced against concerns related to observational inherited limitations for bias and confounding. Researchers should aim to avoid bias in the design of a study, adjust for confounding, and discuss the effects of residual bias on the results.

Unlike randomized controlled trials, which are the gold standard for proving causation, observational studies are prone to biases including confounding. In this article, we describe a novel Bayesian procedure to control for a confounder that is missing across the sequence of studies in a meta-analysis. We motivate the discussion with the example of a meta-analysis of cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies examining the relationship between oral contraceptives and endometriosis. An important unmeasured confounder is dysmennoreah, which is an indication for oral contraceptive use. To adjust for unmeasured confounding, we combine random effects models with probabilistic sensitivity analysis techniques. Information about the unmeasured confounder is incorporated into the analysis via prior distributions, and we use MCMC to sample from posterior.

Performance of Disease Risk Scores, Propensity Scores, and Traditional Multivariable Outcome Regression in the Presence of Multiple Confounders	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						confounding factors (epidemiology); epidemiologic methods; observational study; pharmacoepidemiology	NONSTEROIDAL ANTIINFLAMMATORY DRUGS; CORONARY HEART-DISEASE; SUDDEN CARDIAC DEATH; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; VARIABLE SELECTION; STRATIFICATION; ADJUSTMENT; EVENTS; MODELS; NUMBER	Propensity scores are widely used in cohort studies to improve performance of regression models when considering large numbers of covariates. Another type of summary score, the disease risk score (DRS), which estimates disease probability conditional on nonexposure, has also been suggested. However, little is known about how it compares with propensity scores. Monte Carlo simulations were conducted comparing regression models using the DRS and the propensity score with models that directly adjust for all of the individual covariates. The DRS was calculated in 2 ways: from the unexposed population and from the full cohort. Compared with traditional multivariable outcome regression models, all 3 summary scores had comparable performance for moderate correlation between exposure and covariates and, for strong correlation, the full-cohort DRS and propensity score had comparable performance. When traditional methods had model misspecification, propensity scores and the full-cohort DRS had superior performance. All 4 models were affected by the number of events per covariate, with propensity scores and traditional multivariable outcome regression least affected. These data suggest that, for cohort studies for which covariates are not highly correlated with exposure, the DRS, particularly that calculated from the full cohort, is a useful tool.

Patients' characteristics can affect the exposure (confounding) as well as the timing of routine visits (measurement process), and those characteristics may be altered following a visit which can create dependencies between the monitoring and body mass index when viewed as a stochastic or random processes in time. This may result in a form of selection bias that distorts the estimation of the marginal effect of the antidepressant. Inverse intensity of visit weights have been proposed to adjust for these imbalances, however no approaches have addressed complex settings where the covariate and the monitoring processes affect each other in time so as to induce endogeneity, a situation likely to occur in electronic health records. We review how selection bias due to outcome-dependent follow-up times may arise and propose a new cumulated weight that models a complete monitoring path so as to address the above-mentioned challenges and produce a reliable estimate of the impact of antide-pressants on body mass index. More specifically, we do so using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink in the United Kingdom, comparing the marginal effect of two commonly used antidepressants, citalopram and fluoxetine, on body mass index. The results are compared to those obtained with simpler methods that do not account for the extent of the dependence due to an endogenous covariate process.	[Coulombe, Janie; Moodie, Erica E.

J	Sheikh, MA				Sheikh, Mashhood Ahmed			Confounding and Statistical Significance of Indirect Effects: Childhood Adversity, Education, Smoking, and Anxious and Depressive Symptomatology	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						directeffect; proportion of mediated effect; decomposition; mediation; confounding; anxiety; depression; longitudinal	LIFE-COURSE PATHWAYS; MENTAL-HEALTH; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; MAJOR DEPRESSION; EARLY ADULTHOOD; PHYSICAL HEALTH; YOUNG ADULTHOOD; SOCIAL SUPPORT; OLDER-ADULTS	The life course perspective, the risky families model, and stress-and-coping models provide the rationale for assessing the role of smoking as a mediator in the association between childhood adversity and anxious and depressive symptomatology (ADS) in adulthood. However, no previous study has assessed the independent mediating role of smoking in the association between childhood adversity and ADS in adulthood. Moreover, the importance of mediator-response confounding variables has rarely been demonstrated empirically in social and psychiatric epidemiology. The aim of this paper was to (i) assess the mediating role of smoking in adulthood in the association between childhood adversity and ADS in adulthood, and (ii) assess the change in estimates due to different mediator-response confounding factors (education, alcohol intake, and social support). The present analysis used data collected from 1994 to 2008 within the framework of the Tromso Study (N = 4,530), a representative prospective cohort study of men and women. Seven childhood adversities (low mother's education, low father's education, low financial conditions, exposure to passive smoke, psychological abuse, physical abuse, and substance abuse distress) were used to create a childhood adversity score. Smoking status was measured at a mean age of 54.7 years (Tromso IV), and ADS in adulthood was measured at a mean age of 61.7 years (Tromso V). Mediation analysis was used to assess the indirect effect and the proportion of mediated effect (%) of childhood adversity on ADS in adulthood via smoking in adulthood. The test-retest reliability of smoking was good (Kappa: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.63; 0.71) in this sample. Childhood adversity was associated with a 10% increased risk of smoking in adulthood (Relative risk: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.03; 1.18), and both childhood adversity and smoking in adulthood were associated with greater levels of ADS in adulthood (p < 0.001). Smoking in adulthood did not significantly mediate the association between childhood adversity and ADS in adulthood. However, when education was excluded as a mediator-response confounding variable, the indirect effect of childhood adversity on ADS in adulthood was statistically significant (p < 0.05). This study shows that a careful inclusion of potential confounding variables is important when assessing mediation.

Propensity score methods, which are commonly used in the pharmacoepidemiology literature, can effectively control for baseline confounding by balancing measured baseline confounders and risk factors and creating comparable populations of treated and untreated patients. Methods: We propose the following 5-step checklist to guide the use and evaluation of propensity score methods: (1) select covariates, (2) assess "Table 1" balance in risk factors before propensity score implementation, (3) estimate and implement the propensity score in the study cohort, (4) reassess "Table 1" balance in risk factors after propensity score implementation, and (5) critically evaluate differences between matched and unmatched patients after propensity score implementation. We then applied this checklist to an endoscopy example using a study cohort of 411 adults with newly diagnosed eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), some of whom were treated with esophageal dilation. Results: We identified 156 patients, aged 18 and older, who were treated with esophageal dilation, and 255 patients who were nondilated. We successfully matched 148 (95%) dilated patients to nondilated patients who had a propensity score within 0.1, based on patient age, sex, race, self-reported food allergy, and presence of narrowing at baseline endoscopy. Crude imbalances were observed before propensity score matching in several baseline covariates, including age, sex, and narrowing; however, propensity score matching was successful in achieving balance across all measured covariates. Conclusions: We provide an introduction to propensity score methods, including a straightforward checklist for implementing propensity score methods in nonexperimental studies of treatment effectiveness. Moreover, we demon-strate the advantage of using "Table 1" as a simple but effective diagnostic tool for evaluating the success of propensity score methods in an applied example of esophageal dilation in EoE.

This gap may in part be due to the lack of readily modifiable software to implement these methods. Our objective is to provide computing code that can be tailored to an analyst's dataset. We briefly describe the methods for implementing QBA for misclassification and uncontrolled confounding and present the reader with example code for how such bias analyses, using both summary-level data and individual record-level data, can be implemented in both SAS and R. Our examples show how adjustment for uncontrolled confounding and misclassification can be implemented. Resulting bias-adjusted point estimates can then be compared to conventional results to see the impact of this bias in terms of its direction and magnitude. Further, we show how 95% simulation intervals can be generated that can be compared to conventional 95% confidence intervals to see the impact of the bias on uncertainty. Having easy to implement code that users can apply to their own datasets will hopefully help spur more frequent use of these methods and prevent poor inferences drawn from studies that do not quantify the impact of systematic error on their results.

Here we show that using rich data on comorbidities and automatic variable selection strategies for selecting confounders can better control confounding within a case-control study design and provide a more solid basis for inference regarding the causal effects of drugs on HOIs. Four HOIs are examined: acute kidney injury, acute liver injury, acute myocardial infarction and gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. For each of these HOIs we use a previously published reference set of positive and negative control drugs to evaluate the performance of our methods. Our methods have AUCs that are often substantially higher than the AUCs of a baseline method that only uses demographic characteristics for confounding control. Our methods also give confidence intervals for causal effect parameters that cover the expected no effect value substantially more often than this baseline method. The case-control study design, unlike the self- controlled study design, can be used in the fairly typical setting of EHR databases without longitudinal information on patients. With our variable selection method, these databases can be more effectively used for the detection of ADRs.

Information about missing variables is sometimes available from external validation data, such as surveys or secondary samples drawn from the same source population. In principle, the validation data permit us to recover information about the missing data, but the difficulty is in eliciting a valid model for the nuisance distribution of the missing confounders. Motivated by a British study of the effects of trihalomethane exposure on risk of full-term low birthweight, we describe a flexible Bayesian procedure for adjusting for a vector of missing confounders using external validation data. We summarize the missing confounders with a scalar summary score using the propensity score methodology of Rosenbaum and Rubin. The score has the property that it induces conditional independence between the exposure and the missing confounders, given the measured confounders. It balances the unmeasured confounders across exposure groups, within levels of measured covariates. To adjust for bias, we need only model and adjust for the summary score during Markov chain Monte Carlo computation. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed method reduces bias from several missing confounders over a range of different sample sizes for the validation data.

J	Yan, Y; Ren, MC				Yan, Ying; Ren, Mingchen			Consistent inverse probability of treatment weighted estimation of the average treatment effect with mismeasured time-dependent confounders	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						causal inference; conditional score; marginal structural model; measurement error; sensitivity analysis	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; COVARIATE MEASUREMENT ERROR; ADDITIVE HAZARDS MODELS; MEDIATION ANALYSIS; SURVIVAL-DATA; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; FUNCTIONAL METHODS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; BIAS	In longitudinal studies, the inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) method is commonly employed to estimate the effect of time-dependent treatments on an outcome of interest. However, it has been documented that when the confounders are subject to measurement error, the naive IPTW method which simply ignores measurement error leads to biased treatment effect estimation. In the existing literature, there is a lack of measurement error correction methods that fully remove measurement error effect and produce consistent treatment effect estimation. In this article, we develop a novel consistent IPTW estimation procedure for longitudinal studies. The key step of the proposed method is to use the observed data to construct a corrected function that is unbiased of the unknown IPTW function. Simulation studies reveal that the proposed method outperforms the existing consistent and approximate measurement error correction methods for IPTW estimation of the average treatment effect. Finally, we apply the proposed method to analyze a real dataset.

Applying multiple regression models including the effects of treatment and covariates on outcome is the well-known classical approach to adjust for confounding. In recent years other approaches have been promoted. One of them is based on the propensity score and considers the effect of possible confounders on treatment as a relevant criterion for adjustment. Another proposal is based on using an instrumental variable. Here inference relies on a factor, the instrument, which affects treatment but is thought to be otherwise unrelated to outcome, so that it mimics randomization. Each of these approaches can basically be interpreted as a simple reweighting scheme, designed to address confounding. The procedures will be compared with respect to their fundamental properties, namely, which bias they aim to eliminate, which effect they aim to estimate, and which parameter is modelled. We will expand our overview of methods for analysis of non-randomized studies to methods for analysis of randomized controlled trials and show that analyses of both study types may target different effects and different parameters. The considerations will be illustrated using a breast cancer study with a so-called Comprehensive Cohort Study design, including a randomized controlled trial and a non-randomized study in the same patient population as sub-cohorts. This design offers ideal opportunities to discuss and illustrate the properties of the different approaches.

Standardization typically reweights the stratum-specific rates so that exposure categories become comparable. With the development first of loglinear models, soon also of nonlinear regression techniques (logistic regression, failure time regression) that the emerging computers could handle, regression modelling became the preferred approach, just as was already the case with multiple regression analysis for continuous outcomes. Since the mid 1990s it has become increasingly obvious that weighting methods are still often useful, sometimes even necessary. On this background we aim at describing the emergence of the modelling approach and the refinement of the weighting approach for confounder control.

The "within-pair" estimates acquired through these comparisons are free from confounding from all factors that are shared by the siblings. This has made sibling comparisons popular in studying associations thought likely to suffer confounding from socioeconomic or genetic factors. Despite the wide application of these designs in epidemiology, they have received little scrutiny from a statistical or methodological standpoint. In this paper we show, analytically and through a series of simulations, that the standard interpretation of the models is subject to several limitations that are rarely acknowledged. Although within-pair estimates will not be confounded by factors shared by the siblings, such estimates are more severely biased by non-shared confounders than the unpaired estimate. If siblings are less similar with regard to confounders than to the exposure under study, the within-pair estimate will always be more biased than the ordinary unpaired estimate. Attenuation of associations due to random measurement error in exposure will also be higher in the within-pair estimate, leading within-pair associations to be weaker than corresponding unpaired associations, even in the absence of confounding. Implications for the interpretation of sibling comparison results are discussed.

Although certain functions will require investigator intervention, confounding control is one area that can largely be automated. The high-dimensional propensity score (hd-PS) algorithm is one option for automated confounding control in longitudinal healthcare databases. In this article, we discuss the use of hd-PS for automating confounding control in sequential database cohort studies, as applied to safety monitoring systems. In particular, we discuss the robustness of the covariate selection process, the potential for over- or under-selection of variables including the possibilities of M-bias and Z-bias, the computation requirements, the practical considerations in a federated database network, and the cases where automated confounding adjustment may not function optimally. We also outline recent improvements to the algorithm and show how the algorithm has performed in several published studies. We conclude that despite certain limitations, hd-PS offers substantial advantages over non-automated alternatives in active product safety monitoring systems.

Unfortunately, the word confounding has been used synonymously with several other terms, and it has been used to refer to at least four distinct concepts. This paper provides an overview of confounding and related concepts based on a counterfactual model of causation. In this context, which predominates in nonexperimental research, confounding is a source of bias in the estimation of causal effects. Special attention is given to the history of definitions of confounding, the distinction between confounding and confounders, problems in the control of confounding, the relations of confounding to exchangeability and collapsibility, and confounding in randomized trials.

To incorporate practitioners' judgments about treatment indication and preprocedural prognosis into an observational study of cerebral aneurysm treatments, the author and colleagues presented patient characteristics and radiographic images from 179 aneurysm cases (University of California, San Francisco, 1990-1997) to panels of practitioners who were blinded as to actual treatment selection and outcome. In this way, the review process was designed to recreate the presentation of information in a prospective study. Judgments about inclusion and prognosis were reproducible. Perceived prognosis correlated with complication rates and provided information not present in a multivariable model including all available clinical characteristics. The association between treatment modality and outcome was examined while stratifying and adjusting for differences in perceived prognosis. Blinded prospective review may provide an unbiased observational study design with which to define a cohort that could have received any of the treatments being compared and to measure and adjust for overall perceived procedural risk.

Causation and familial confounding as explanations for the associations of polygenic risk scores with breast cancer: Evidence from innovative ICE FALCON and ICE CRISTAL analyses	GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						breast cancer; causation; familial confounding; family data; ICE CRISTAL; ICE FALCON; siblings	GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY; MAMMOGRAPHIC DENSITY; BOADICEA MODEL; WOMEN; AGE; INFERENCE; INSIGHTS; HISTORY; TWIN	A polygenic risk score (PRS) combines the associations of multiple genetic variants that could be due to direct causal effects, indirect genetic effects, or other sources of familial confounding. We have developed new approaches to assess evidence for and against causation by using family data for pairs of relatives (Inference about Causation from Examination of FAmiliaL CONfounding [ICE FALCON]) or measures of family history (Inference about Causation from Examining Changes in Regression coefficients and Innovative STatistical AnaLyses [ICE CRISTAL]). Inference is made from the changes in regression coefficients of relatives' PRSs or PRS and family history before and after adjusting for each other. We applied these approaches to two breast cancer PRSs and multiple studies and found that (a) for breast cancer diagnosed at a young age, for example, <50 years, there was no evidence that the PRSs were causal, while (b) for breast cancer diagnosed at later ages, there was consistent evidence for causation explaining increasing amounts of the PRS-disease association. The genetic variants in the PRS might be in linkage disequilibrium with truly causal variants and not causal themselves. These PRSs cause minimal heritability of breast cancer at younger ages. There is also evidence for nongenetic factors shared by first-degree relatives that explain breast cancer familial aggregation. Familial associations are not necessarily due to genes, and genetic associations are not necessarily causal.

The aim of many longitudinal studies is to estimate the causal effect of a time varying exposure on an outcome that requires adjusting for time varying confounding. Time varying confounding affected by previous exposure often occurs in practice, but it is usually adjusted for by using conventional analytical methods such as time dependent Cox regression, random effects models, or generalised estimating equations, which are known to provide biased effect estimates in this setting. This article explains time varying confounding affected by previous exposure and outlines three causal methods proposed to appropriately adjust for this potential bias: inverseprobability-of-treatment weighting, the parametric G formula, and G estimation.

Typically, it is almost impossible to observe all components of the system. Missing certain components can lead to the appearance of spurious interactions. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the effect of this and to demonstrate that distinction between latent confounders and volume conduction is possible in some cases. New method: Our new method uses a combination of renormalised partial directed coherence and analysis of the (partial) covariance matrix of residual noise process to detect instantaneous, spurious interactions. Sub-network analyses are performed to infer the true network structure of the underlying system. Results: We provide evidence that it is possible to distinguish between instantaneous interactions that occur as a result of a latent confounder and those that occur as a result of volume conduction. Comparison with existing methods: Our novel approach demonstrates to what extent inference of unobserved important processes as well as the distinction between latent confounders and volume conduction is possible. We suggest a combination of measures of Granger-causality and covariance selection models to achieve this numerically. Conclusions: Sub-network analyses enable a much more precise and correct inference of the true underlying network structure in some cases. From this it is possible to distinguish between unobserved processes and volume conduction. Our approach is straightforwardly adaptable to various measures of Granger-causality emphasising its ubiquitous successful applicability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Confounding by Socioeconomic Status in Epidemiological Studies of Air Pollution and Health: Challenges and Opportunities	ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES			English	Article							PARTICULATE MATTER; INCOME INEQUALITY; POPULATION HEALTH; SOCIAL-STATUS; CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH; LIFE EXPECTANCY; TERM EXPOSURE; MORTALITY; NEIGHBORHOOD; REGRESSION	BACKGROUND: Despite a vast air pollution epidemiology literature to date and the recognition that lower-socioeconomic status (SES) populations are often disproportionately exposed to pollution, there is little research identifying optimal means of adjusting for confounding by SES in air pollution epidemiology, nor is there a strong understanding of biases that may result from improper adjustment. OBJECTIVE: We aim to provide a conceptualization of SES and a review of approaches to its measurement in the U.S. context and discuss pathways by which SES may influence health and confound effects of air pollution. We explore bias related to measurement and operationalization and identify statistical approaches to reduce bias and confounding. DISCUSSION: Drawing on the social epidemiology, health geography, and economic literatures, we describe how SES, a multifaceted construct operating through myriad pathways, may be conceptualized and operationalized in air pollution epidemiology studies. SES varies across individuals within the contexts of place, time, and culture. Although no single variable or index can fully capture SES, many studies rely on only a single measure. We recommend examining multiple facets of SES appropriate to the study design. Furthermore, investigators should carefully consider the multiple mechanisms by which SES might be operating to identify those SES indicators that may be most appropriate for a given context or study design and assess the impact of improper adjustment on air pollution effect estimates. Last, exploring model contraction and expansion methods may enrich adjustment, whereas statistical approaches, such as quantitative bias analysis, may be used to evaluate residual confounding.

Confounding and regression adjustment in difference-in-differences studies	HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						difference&#8208; in&#8208; differences; matching; parallel trends; regression adjustment; time&#8208; varying confounding	INTERACTION TERMS; MODELS	Objective To define confounding bias in difference-in-difference studies and compare regression- and matching-based estimators designed to correct bias due to observed confounders. Data sources We simulated data from linear models that incorporated different confounding relationships: time-invariant covariates with a time-varying effect on the outcome, time-varying covariates with a constant effect on the outcome, and time-varying covariates with a time-varying effect on the outcome. We considered a simple setting that is common in the applied literature: treatment is introduced at a single time point and there is no unobserved treatment effect heterogeneity. Study design We compared the bias and root mean squared error of treatment effect estimates from six model specifications, including simple linear regression models and matching techniques. Data collection Simulation code is provided for replication. Principal findings Confounders in difference-in-differences are covariates that change differently over time in the treated and comparison group or have a time-varying effect on the outcome. When such a confounding variable is measured, appropriately adjusting for this confounder (ie, including the confounder in a regression model that is consistent with the causal model) can provide unbiased estimates with optimal SE. However, when a time-varying confounder is affected by treatment, recovering an unbiased causal effect using difference-in-differences is difficult. Conclusions Confounding in difference-in-differences is more complicated than in cross-sectional settings, from which techniques and intuition to address observed confounding cannot be imported wholesale. Instead, analysts should begin by postulating a causal model that relates covariates, both time-varying and those with time-varying effects on the outcome, to treatment. This causal model will then guide the specification of an appropriate analytical model (eg, using regression or matching) that can produce unbiased treatment effect estimates. We emphasize the importance of thoughtful incorporation of covariates to address confounding bias in difference-in-difference studies.

Until recently, Slater was one of the few communication scientists to suggest that media effects scholars engage in overcontrol. Bushman and Anderson have now echoed this concern in the context of a broader treatise on research trends in the media violence literature. The present study responded to Wright's recent discussion of control variable usage in the pornography literature. Specifically, using a national probability sample of approximately 1,900 U.S. adults, the present study assessed whether multiple demographic variables routinely modeled as controls in the pornography effects literature may be better conceptualized as initiating predictors. Results were inconsistent with the confounding approach but consistent with the hypothesis that individual differences predict cognitive response states that increase or decrease the likelihood of media effects.

Testing mechanisms for the relationship between depression and smoking in a longitudinal cohort study	ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS			English	Article						Smoking; Depression; Cohort; Causal pathways; Adolescent	CIGARETTE-SMOKING; MAJOR DEPRESSION; SUBSTANCE USE; PSYCHIATRIC COMORBIDITY; TOBACCO SMOKING; RISK-FACTORS; SYMPTOMS; ADOLESCENTS; ASSOCIATIONS; DEPENDENCE	Introduction: The relationship between the onset of smoking and the onset of depression among adolescents has been well document, but the mechanisms underlying the relationship are unclear. This paper uses an empirical method to assess potential intermediate variables in the pathway between changes in depressive symptoms and cigarette smoking in a longitudinal cohort of adolescents. Methods: 837 participants from a cohort in Montreal, Canada who had not smoked and did not have elevated depressive symptoms at baseline were followed for five years from 1999 to 2003. The role of a set of 15 variables previously identified in the literature as potential confounders were systematically evaluated as predictors of exposure and outcome, for attenuation of the association by more than 10%, and for intra-individual change in the variable after onset of exposure. Results: The magnitude of the association between smoking and depressive symptoms was fully attenuated after adjustment for all variables included indiscriminately. A concept map was developed detailing the empirical associations between the variables within this data set. Stress, worry about weight, and worry about parents were identified as intermediate variables for both smoking predicting depressive symptoms and depressive symptoms predicting smoking. Cox regressions with appropriate confounders maintained statistical significance. Conclusion: Cigarette smoking is associated with higher depressive symptoms prior to and after inclusion of empirical confounders. Inclusion of intermediate variables in multivariable models can lead to the erroneous conclusion that there is no association between smoking and depression. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

From bad to worse: collider stratification amplifies confounding bias in the "obesity paradox"	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Obesity paradox; Confounding bias; Selection bias	MORTALITY; SMOKING	Smoking is often identified as a confounder of the obesity-mortality relationship. Selection bias can amplify the magnitude of an existing confounding bias. The objective of the present report is to demonstrate how confounding bias due to cigarette smoking is increased in the presence of collider stratification bias using an empirical example and directed acyclic graphs. The empirical example uses data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, a prospective cohort study of 15,792 men and women in the United States. Poisson regression models were used to examine the confounding effect of smoking. In the total ARIC study population, smoking produced a confounding bias of < 3 percentage points. This result was obtained by comparing the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for obesity from a model adjusted for smoking was 1.07 (95 % CI 1.00, 1.15) with one that did not adjust for smoking was 1.10 (95 % CI 1.03, 1.18). However, among smokers with CVD, the obesity IRR was 0.89 (95 % CI 0.81, 0.99), while among non-smokers with CVD the obesity IRR was 1.20 (95 % CI 1.03, 1.41). The empirical and graphical explanations presented suggest that the magnitude of the confounding bias induced by smoking is greater in the presence of collider stratification bias.

An Analysis of the EPIC-Heidelberg Cohort	NUTRIENTS			English	Article						red meat; processed meat; poultry; dairy; mortality	PROCESSED MEAT CONSUMPTION; CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; GERMAN PART; ALL-CAUSE; RED MEAT; CANCER; COUNTRIES; NUTRITION; REPRODUCIBILITY; VALIDITY	While prior prospective iso-caloric substitution studies show a robust association between higher intake of animal protein and risk of mortality, associations observed for mortality risk in relation to major food sources of animal protein have been generally more diverse. We used the EPIC-Heidelberg cohort to examine if confounding, notably, by smoking, adiposity, or alcohol intake, could cause inconsistencies in estimated mortality hazard ratios (HR) related to intake levels of different types of meat and dairy products. Higher intakes of red or processed meats, and lower intakes of milk or cheese, were observed among current heavy smokers, participants with obesity, or heavy alcohol drinkers. Adjusting for age, sex, and total energy intake, risk models showed increased all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer-related mortality with higher red or processed meat intakes (HR ranging from 1.25 [95% confidence interval = 1.15-1.36] to 1.76 [1.46-2.12] comparing highest to lowest tertiles), but reduced risks for poultry, milk, or cheese (HR ranging from 0.55 [0.43-0.72] to 0.88 [0.81-0.95]). Adjusting further for smoking history, adiposity indices, alcohol consumption, and physical activity levels, the statistical significance of all these observed was erased, except for the association of processed meat intake with cardiovascular mortality (HR = 1.36 [CI = 1.13-1.64]) and cheese intake with cancer mortality (HR = 0.86 [0.76-0.98]), which, however, were substantially attenuated. These findings suggest heavy confounding and provide little support for the hypothesis that animal protein, as a nutrient, is a major determinant of mortality risk.

PROG-IMT Study Grp	Multiple imputation for handling systematically missing confounders in meta-analysis of individual participant data	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						missing data; IPD meta-analysis; multilevel model; multiple imputation: chained equations	INTIMA-MEDIA THICKNESS; PATIENT DATA; CAROTID ATHEROSCLEROSIS; RISK; SURVIVAL; MODEL; PROGRESSION; PREDICTION; DISEASE; TRIALS	A variable is systematically missing' if it is missing for all individuals within particular studies in an individual participant data meta-analysis. When a systematically missing variable is a potential confounder in observational epidemiology, standard methods either fail to adjust the exposure-disease association for the potential confounder or exclude studies where it is missing. We propose a new approach to adjust for systematically missing confounders based on multiple imputation by chained equations. Systematically missing data are imputed via multilevel regression models that allow for heterogeneity between studies. A simulation study compares various choices of imputation model. An illustration is given using data from eight studies estimating the association between carotid intima media thickness and subsequent risk of cardiovascular events. Results are compared with standard methods and also with an extension of a published method that exploits the relationship between fully adjusted and partially adjusted estimated effects through a multivariate random effects meta-analysis model. We conclude that multiple imputation provides a practicable approach that can handle arbitrary patterns of systematic missingness. Bias is reduced by including sufficient between-study random effects in the imputation model. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Steenland, K; Greenland, S				Steenland, K; Greenland, S			Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis and Bayesian analysis of smoking as an unmeasured confounder in a study of silica and lung cancer	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Bayes theorem; confounding factors (epidemiology); epidemiologic methods; lung neoplasms; Monte Carlo method; occupational exposure; occupations; smoking	BIAS; UNCERTAINTY; IMPACT	Conventional confidence intervals reflect uncertainty due to random error but omit uncertainty due to biases, such as confounding, selection bias, and measurement error. Such uncertainty can be quantified, especially if the investigator has some idea of the amount of such bias. A traditional sensitivity analysis produces one or more point estimates for the exposure effect hypothetically adjusted for bias, but it does not provide a range of effect measures given the likely range of bias. Here the authors used Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis and Bayesian bias analysis to provide such a range, using data from a US silica-lung cancer study in which results were potentially confounded by smoking. After positing a distribution for the smoking habits of workers and referents, a distribution of rate ratios for the effect of smoking on lung cancer, and a model for the bias parameter, the authors derived a distribution for the silica-lung cancer rate ratios hypothetically adjusted for smoking. The original standardized mortality ratio for the silica-lung cancer relation was 1.60 (95% confidence interval: 1.31, 1.93). Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis, adjusting for possible confounding by smoking, led to an adjusted standardized mortality ratio of 1.43 (95% Monte Carlo limits: 1.15, 1.78). Bayesian results were similar (95% posterior limits: 1.13, 1.84). The authors believe that these types of analyses, which make explicit and quantify sources of uncertainty, should be more widely adopted by epidemiologists.

This paper discusses the issue of standardization of the assessment of tobacco exposure in German epidemiological studies based on a suggestion of the working group "Epidemiological methods" of the German Society of Epidemiology (DGEpi), the German Society of Social Medicine and Prevention (DGSMP), and German Society of Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology (GMDS) together with the working group "Epidemiology in the workplace" of the DGEpi and the German Society of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (DGAUM). The main element is a short questionnaire for German adults for the assessment of tobacco smoking in epidemiological studies where smoking is a potential confounder. In addition, information on the consideration of intermittent periods of non-smoking, a very short questionnaire for medical examinations in the workplace or non-responder interviews as well as the quantification and statistical modelling of smoking are presented. A brief discussion of scientific problems and questionnaires related to the exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is given.

When a "Confounder" Is Only Measured After Exposure	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Bias; Confounding; Mediation; Observational study	SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; CAUSAL DIAGRAMS; SELECTION BIAS; FORMULAS; MODELS; IMPACT; RISK	Advice regarding the analysis of observational studies of exposure effects usually is against adjustment for factors that occur after the exposure, as they may be caused by the exposure (or mediate the effect of exposure on outcome), so potentially leading to collider stratification bias. However, such factors could also be caused by unmeasured confounding factors, in which case adjusting for them will also remove some of the bias due to confounding. We derive expressions for collider stratification bias when conditioning and confounding bias when not conditioning on the mediator, in the presence of unmeasured confounding (assuming that all associations are linear and there are no interactions). Using simulations, we show that generally neither the conditioned nor the unconditioned estimate is unbiased, and the trade-off between them depends on the magnitude of the effect of the exposure that is mediated relative to the effect of the unmeasured confounders and their relations with the mediator. We illustrate the use of the bias expressions via three examples: neuroticism and mortality (adjusting for the mediator appears the least biased option), glycated hemoglobin levels and systolic blood pressure (adjusting gives smaller bias), and literacy in primary school pupils (not adjusting gives smaller bias). Our formulae and simulations can inform quantitative bias analysis as well as analysis strategies for observational studies in which there is a potential for unmeasured confounding.

We assessed the association, accounting for selective dropout due to death or dementia, and, in a subsample, accounting for confounding by early-life intelligence. Data from the Danish component of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (n = 3,400) were linked to registry data (education records, dementia diagnoses, and mortality) and the Danish Conscription Database (youth intelligence measurements for 854 men). Word recall and verbal fluency were assessed up to 4 times over 10 years (2004-2013) and combined by averaging the z scores. We fitted a joint model linking a time-to-event model for dementia or death to a linear mixed-effects model for cognitive change. Rate of cognitive decline was slower among people with high education compared with low education (beta = 0.112, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.056,0.170). Adjusting for youth intelligence did not attenuate the association between education and cognitive decline (crude beta = 0.136,95% CI: 0.028,0.244 vs. adjusted beta = 0.145,95% CI: 0.022,0.269). The results suggest that higher education may slow cognitive decline in later life. In this sample, results changed little when accounting for selective attrition and confounding by intelligence.

Investigation of the structure and magnitude of time-varying uncontrolled confounding in simulated cohort data analyzed using g-computation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Simulation; g-computation; time-varying; uncontrolled confounding; marginal structural model	CAUSAL INFERENCE; MODELS	Background When estimating the effect of time-varying exposures on longer-term outcomes, the assumption of conditional exchangeability or no uncontrolled confounding extends beyond baseline confounding to include time-varying confounding. We illustrate the structures and magnitude of uncontrolled time-varying confounding in exposure effect estimates obtained from g-computation when sequential conditional exchangeability is violated.Methods We used directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to depict time-varying uncontrolled confounding. We performed simulations and used g-computation to quantify the effects of each time-varying exposure for each DAG type. Models adjusting all time-varying confounders were considered the true (bias-adjusted) estimate. The exclusion of time-varying uncontrolled confounders represented the biased effect estimate and an unmet 'no uncontrolled confounding' assumption. True and biased estimates were compared across DAGs, with different magnitudes of uncontrolled confounding.Results Time-varying uncontrolled confounding can present in several scenarios, including relationships into subsequently measured exposure(s), outcome, unmeasured confounder(s) and other measured confounder(s). In simulations, effect estimates obtained from g-computation were more biased in DAGs when the uncontrolled confounders were directly related to the outcome. Complex DAGs that included relationships between uncontrolled confounders and other variables and relationships where exposures caused uncontrolled confounders at the next time point resulted in the most biased effect estimates. In these complex DAGs, excluding uncontrolled confounders affected the multiple effect estimates.Conclusions Time-varying uncontrolled confounding has the potential to substantially impact observed effect estimates. Given the importance of longitudinal studies in advising public health, the impact of time-varying uncontrolled confounding warrants more recognition and evaluation using quantitative bias analysis.

Using Embeddings to Correct for Unobserved Confounding in Networks	ADVANCES IN NEURAL INFORMATION PROCESSING SYSTEMS 32 (NIPS 2019)	Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems		English	Proceedings Paper	33rd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS)	DEC 08-14, 2019	Vancouver, CANADA					We consider causal inference in the presence of unobserved confounding. We study the case where a proxy is available for the unobserved confounding in the form of a network connecting the units. For example, the link structure of a social network carries information about its members. We show how to effectively use the proxy to do causal inference. The main idea is to reduce the causal estimation problem to a semi-supervised prediction of both the treatments and outcomes. Networks admit high-quality embedding models that can be used for this semi-supervised prediction. We show that the method yields valid inferences under suitable (weak) conditions on the quality of the predictive model. We validate the method with experiments on a semi-synthetic social network dataset.

Cumming, Steven; Diop, Awa; Talbot, Denis			Confounding adjustment methods for multi-level treatment comparisons under lack of positivity and unknown model specification	JOURNAL OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Multi-level treatment; machine learning; confounding adjustment; plasmode simulation; simulation	CAUSAL INFERENCE	Imbalances in covariates between treatment groups are frequent in observational studies and can lead to biased comparisons. Various adjustment methods can be employed to correct these biases in the context of multi-level treatments (> 2). Analytical challenges, such as positivity violations and incorrect model specification due to unknown functional relationships between covariates and treatment or outcome, may affect their ability to yield unbiased results. Such challenges were expected in a comparison of fire-suppression interventions for preventing fire growth. We identified the overlap weights, augmented overlap weights, bias-corrected matching and targeted maximum likelihood as methods with the best potential to address those challenges. A simple variance estimator for the overlap weight estimators that can naturally be combined with machine learning is proposed. In a simulation study, we investigated the performance of these methods as well as those of simpler alternatives. Adjustment methods that included an outcome modeling component performed better than those that focused on the treatment mechanism in our simulations. Additionally, machine learning implementation was observed to efficiently compensate for the unknown model specification for the former methods, but not the latter. Based on these results, we compared the effectiveness of fire-suppression interventions using the augmented overlap weight estimator.	[Diop, S.

A Simulation-Based Assessment of Alternative Explanations for Apparent Confounding in "PM Decomposition" Studies	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Simulation; Particulate matter; Mortality; Confounding; PM decomposition	PARTICULATE AIR-POLLUTION; EXTENDED FOLLOW-UP; MEASUREMENT ERROR; DAILY MORTALITY; UNITED-STATES; 6 CITIES; EXPOSURE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PM2.5; PARTICLES	Determining whether there is a causal link between chronic exposure to PM2.5 (atmospheric particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 mu m or less) and mortality is a fundamental challenge in determining appropriate air quality standards for PM2.5. While numerous epidemiological studies have found a statistical association between PM2.5 and mortality, unmeasured confounding in this relationship remains a concern. Several recent studies have examined the possibility of unmeasured confounding of the long-term association between PM2.5 exposure and mortality by decomposing PM2.5 into two orthogonal components - a "global" component that measures the national trend in pollution, and a "local" component that measures the local trend in pollution after controlling for the national trend. Generally, these "PM decomposition" studies find that while PM2.5 and mortality are trending downward over time at the national level, areas with steeper declines in PM2.5 do not have correspondingly steep declines in mortality. This finding is consistent with the long-term relationship between PM2.5 and mortality being confounded by some other, unmeasured, long-term trends. However, alternative explanations for these findings have been proposed under which there is still a causal link between PM2.5 and mortality. This study conducts simulation-based tests of four of these proposed alternative explanations - the omission of spatial variation in PM2.5 and mortality, confounding at the local level, measurement error, and an association between PM(2.5 )and mortality at a different time scale than those tested in the PM decomposition studies. We find that none of these alternative explanations can reproduce the results in the PM decomposition studies while simultaneously allowing for a causal link between PM2.5 and mortality.

The causal relationship remains unclear due to the limited scope of the existing studies and the high prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) in BD patients. The objective of this study is to clarify the role that BDs seem to have in the development of acute cerebrovascular accidents (ACAs). Methods This is an observational prospective study. The CVRFs and demographic factors of a sample of our population were noted. Five clusters of patients were tracked over the course of 2 years to detect and diagnose BDs and ACAs. The causal relationships between the CVRFs, BDs and ACAs were analyzed in a univariate analysis. A logistic regression multivariant analysis was performed on those variables that reached statistical significance. Results The sample included 7886 participants and 31 ACAs were recorded. CVRFs that reached statistical significance included age >= 60, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation and previous ACAs. The relationship between BDs and ACAs always reached statistical significance, regardless of how the BD variable was defined. Five different multivariate analyses were performed, but in none of them did the BD variables significantly reduce the deviance and thus, they were not taken into account when building the final model. Conclusion This study shows that BDs are probably confounders that are closely linked to other CVRFs and they are also useful red flags to identify patients at a higher risk of suffering from ACAs.

The ACDE is the component of the total exposure effect that is not relayed through the specified intermediate. Even if the total effect is unconfounded, the usual ACDE estimate may be biased when an unmeasured variable affects the intermediate and outcome variables. Using linear programming optimization to compute non-parametric bounds, we develop new ACDE estimators for binary measured variables in this causal structure, and use root mean square confounding bias (RMSB) to compare their performance with the usual stratified estimator in simulated distributions of target populations comprised of the 64 possible potential response types as well as distributions of target populations restricted to subsets of 18 or 12 potential response types defined by monotonicity or no-interactions assumptions of unit-level causal effects. We also consider target population distributions conditioned on fixed outcome risk among the unexposed, or fixed true ACDE in one stratum of the intermediate. Results show that a midpoint estimator constructed from the optimization bounds has consistently lower RMSB than the usual stratified estimator both unconditionally and conditioned on any risk in the unexposed. When conditioning on true ACDE, this midpoint estimator perfouns more poorly only when conditioned on an extreme true ACDE in one stratum of the intermediate, yet outperforms the stratified estimator in the other stratum when interaction is permitted. An alternate 'limit-modified crude' estimator can never perform less favourably than the stratified estimator, and often has lower RMSB. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We sought to investigate different methods for causal inference in simulated data sets with measured and unmeasured confounders.MethodsThe simulated data included three types of outcomes (continuous, binary, and time-to-event), treatment assignment, two measured baseline confounders, and one unmeasured confounding factor. Three scenarios were set to create different intensities of confounding effect (e.g., small and blocked confounding paths, medium and blocked confounding paths, and one large unblocked confounding path for scenario 1 to 3, respectively) caused by the unmeasured confounder. The methods of g-computation (GC), inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW), overlap weighting (OW), standardized mortality/morbidity ratio (SMR), and targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE) were used to estimate average treatment effects and reduce potential biases.ResultsThe results with the greatest extent of biases were from the raw model that ignored all the potential confounders. In scenario 2, the unmeasured factor indirectly influenced the treatment assignment through a measured controlling factor and led to medium confounding. The methods of GC, IPTW, OW, SMR, and TMLE removed most of bias observed in average treatment effects for all three types of outcomes from the raw model. Similar results were found in scenario 1, but the results tended to be biased in scenario 3. GC had the best performance followed by OW.ConclusionsThe aforesaid methods can be used for causal inference in externally controlled studies when there is no large, unblockable confounding path for an unmeasured confounder. GC and OW are the preferable approaches.

Methods: The quality of included articles was assessed according to Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale and the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology. A random effects model was used to calculate pooled risk ratios and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), and publication bias was tested by Egger statistical test. Results: Eight studies were included finally. We found a crude positive association of prenatal antibiotics use during each pregnancy trimester and risk of childhood asthma or wheeze with RRs of 1.28 (95% CI, 1.09-1.51) for the first trimester of pregnancy, 1.25 (95% CI, 1.02-1.52) for the second trimester, and 1.25 (95% Cl, 1.05-1.49) for the third trimester. However, when considering potential factors of maternal infections and presence of siblings, the relationship for each trimester was insignificant. Conclusions: This systemic review and meta-analysis proposed a crude positive association between prenatal antibiotic use in every specific trimester and risk of childhood asthma or wheeze. However, adjustment for confounders decreased the relative risk estimates, supporting the concept that these associations are, at least in part, because of confounding by indication.

Further, previous studies have not accounted for possible time-dependent confounding of the association between MBD markers and death due to the effect of markers of MBD on treatments, which subsequently may affect MBD markers. Study Design: Multicenter, 3-year, prospective, case-cohort study. Setting & Participants: 8,229 hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (parathyroid hormone level <= 180 pg/mL and/or receiving vitamin D receptor activators) at 86 facilities in Japan. Predictors: Serum phosphorus, calcium, and parathyroid hormone levels. Outcome: All-cause mortality. Measurements: Marginal structural models were used to compute absolute differences in all-cause mortality associated with different levels of predictors while accounting for time-dependent confounding. Results: The association between phosphorus level and mortality appeared U-shaped, although only higher phosphorus level categories reached statistical significance: compared to those with phosphorus levels of 5.0-5.9 mg/dL (1.61-1.93 mmol/L), patients with the highest (>= 9.0 mg/dL [>= 2.90 mmol/L]) phosphorus levels had 9.4 excess deaths/100 person-years (rate ratio, 2.79 [95% CI, 1.26-6.15]), whereas no association was found for the lowest phosphorus category (< 3.0 mg/dL [< 0.97 mmol/L]; rate ratio, 1.54 [95% CI, 0.87-2.71]). Similarly, hypercalcemia (>= 10.0 mg/dL [>= 2.50 mmol/L]) was associated with excess deaths, and the highest level of hypercalcemia (>= 11.0 mg/dL [>= 2.75 mmol/L]) was associated with 5.8 excess deaths/100 person-years ( rate ratio, 2.38 [ 95% CI, 1.77-3.21]) compared to those with levels of 9.0-9.4 mg/dL (2.25-2.37 mmol/L). Abnormally high parathyroid hormone levels were not associated with excess deaths. Limitations: Possible residual confounding. Conclusions: These results reinforce the idea that serum calcium (in addition to phosphorus) level is an important predictor of the absolute risk of death in hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Adding flexible splines to a regression model is a simple approach for spatial confounding adjustment, but the spline degrees of freedom do not provide an easily interpretable spatial scale. We describe a method for quantifying the extent of spatial confounding adjustment in terms of the Euclidean distance at which variation is removed. We develop this approach for confounding adjustment with splines and using Fourier and wavelet filtering. We demonstrate differences in the spatial scales that these bases can represent and provide a comparison of methods for selecting the amount of confounding adjustment. We find the best performance for selecting the amount of adjustment by using an information criterion evaluated on an outcome model without exposure. We apply this method to spatial adjustment in an analysis of fine particulate matter and blood pressure in a cohort of US women.

Traditional statistical methods for removing confounders are often incompatible with modern deep networks. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel learning framework, named ReConfirm, based on the invariant risk minimization (IRM) theory to eliminate the biases caused by confounding variables and make deep networks more robust. Our approach allows end-to-end model training while capturing causal features responsible for pathological findings instead of spurious correlations. We evaluate our approach on NIH chest X-ray classification tasks where sex and age are confounders.

Multiple imputation (MI) is a potential solution for handling missing covariates in the estimation of the PS. However, it is not clear how to best apply MI strategies in the context of PSM. We conducted a simulation study to compare the performances of popular non-MI missing data methods and various MI-based strategies under different missing data mechanisms. We found that commonly applied missing data methods resulted in biased and inefficient estimates, and we observed large variation in performance across MI-based strategies. Based on our findings, we recommend 1) estimating the PS after applying MI to impute missing confounders; 2) conducting PSM within each imputed dataset followed by averaging the treatment effects to arrive at one summarized finding; 3) a bootstrapped-based variance to account for uncertainty of PS estimation, matching, and imputation; and 4) inclusion of key auxiliary variables in the imputation model.

However, the assumptions regarding unmeasured mediator-outcome confounding and intermediate mediator-outcome confounding that are required for the determination of NDEs and NIEs present practical challenges. To address this problem, we introduce an instrumental blocker, a novel quasi-instrumental variable, to relax both of these assumptions, and we define a swapped direct effect (SDE) and a swapped indirect effect (SIE) to assess the mediation. We show that the SDE and SIE are identical to the NDE and NIE, respectively, based on a causal interpretation. Moreover, the empirical expressions of the SDE and SIE are derived with and without an intermediate mediator-outcome confounder. Then, a multiply robust estimation method is derived to mitigate the model misspecification problem. We prove that the proposed estimator is consistent, asymptotically normal, and achieves the semiparametric efficiency bound. As an illustration, we apply the proposed method to genomic datasets of lung cancer to investigate the potential role of the epidermal growth factor receptor in the treatment of lung cancer.

ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA			English	Article							BLOOD-PRESSURE-MEASUREMENT; PALLIATIVE CARE RESEARCH; RANDOMIZED-TRIALS; ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT; MEDIATION ANALYSIS; PROPENSITY-SCORE; SELECTION BIAS; CLINICAL-TRIALS; MATCHED-COHORT; TOTAL HIP	Epidemiologists seek to make a valid inference about the causal effect between an exposure and a disease in a specific population, using representative sample data from a specific population. Clinical researchers likewise seek to make a valid inference about the association between an intervention and outcome(s) in a specific population, based upon their randomly collected, representative sample data. Both do so by using the available data about the sample variable to make a valid estimate about its corresponding or underlying, but unknown population parameter. Random error in an experiment can be due to the natural, periodic fluctuation or variation in the accuracy or precision of virtually any data sampling technique or health measurement tool or scale. In a clinical research study, random error can be due to not only innate human variability but also purely chance. Systematic error in an experiment arises from an innate flaw in the data sampling technique or measurement instrument. In the clinical research setting, systematic error is more commonly referred to as systematic bias. The most commonly encountered types of bias in anesthesia, perioperative, critical care, and pain medicine research include recall bias, observational bias (Hawthorne effect), attrition bias, misclassification or informational bias, and selection bias. A confounding variable is a factor associated with both the exposure of interest and the outcome of interest. A confounding variable (confounding factor or confounder) is a variable that correlates (positively or negatively) with both the exposure and outcome. Confounding is typically not an issue in a randomized trial because the randomized groups are sufficiently balanced on all potential confounding variables, both observed and nonobserved. However, confounding can be a major problem with any observational (nonrandomized) study. Ignoring confounding in an observational study will often result in a "distorted" or incorrect estimate of the association or treatment effect. Interaction among variables, also known as effect modification, exists when the effect of 1 explanatory variable on the outcome depends on the particular level or value of another explanatory variable. Bias and confounding are common potential explanations for statistically significant associations between exposure and outcome when the true relationship is noncausal. Understanding interactions is vital to proper interpretation of treatment effects. These complex concepts should be consistently and appropriately considered whenever one is not only designing but also analyzing and interpreting data from a randomized trial or observational study.

We accessed a cohort of patients with relapsing-onset MS from British Columbia, Canada (1995-2013), to examine the potential survival advantage associated with beta-interferon exposure using a marginal structural model. Accounting for potential treatment-confounder feedback between comorbidity, MS disease progression, and beta-interferon exposure, we found an association between beta-interferon exposure of at least 6 contiguous months and improved survival (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.63, 95% confidence interval 0.47, 0.86). We also assessed potential effect modifications by sex, baseline age, or baseline disease duration, and found these factors to be important effect modifiers. Sparse follow-up due to variability in patient contact with the health system is one of the biggest challenges in longitudinal analyses. We considered several single-level and multilevel multiple imputation approaches to deal with sparse follow-up and disease progression information; both types of approach produced similar estimates. Compared to ad hoc imputation approaches, such as linear interpolation (HR = 0.63), and last observation carried forward (HR = 0.65), all multiple imputation approaches produced a smaller hazard ratio (HR = 0.53), although the direction of effect and conclusions drawn concerning the survival advantage remained the same.

J	Wiedermann, W; Li, XT				Wiedermann, Wolfgang; Li, Xintong			Confounder detection in linear mediation models: Performance of kernel-based tests of independence	BEHAVIOR RESEARCH METHODS			English	Article						Mediation analysis; Confounder; Exogeneity; Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion; Nonnormality	INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES; DIRECTION-DEPENDENCE; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; JOBS INTERVENTION; CAUSAL; NORMALITY; KURTOSIS; SKEWNESS; SIZE; IDENTIFICATION	It is well-known that the identification of direct and indirect effects in mediation analysis requires strong unconfoundedness assumptions. Even when the predictor is under experimental control, unconfoundedness assumptions must be imposed on the mediator-outcome relation in order to guarantee valid indirect-effect identification. Researchers are therefore advised to test for unconfoundedness when estimating mediation effects. Significance tests to evaluate unconfoundedness usually rely on an instrumental variable (IV)-that is, a variable that is nonindependent of the explanatory variable and, at the same time, independent of all exogenous factors that affect the outcome when the explanatory variable is held constant. Because IVs may be hard to come by, the present study shows that confounders of the mediator-outcome relation can be detected without making use of IVs when variables are nonnormal. We show that kernel-based tests of independence are able to detect confounding under nonnormality. Results from a simulation study are presented that suggest that these tests perform well in terms of Type I error protection and statistical power, independent of the distribution or measurement level of the confounder. A real-world data example from the Job Search Intervention Study (JOBS II) illustrates how the presented approach can be used to minimize the risk of obtaining biased indirect-effect estimates. The data requirements and role of unconfoundedness tests as diagnostic tools are discussed. A Monte Carlo-based power analysis tool for sample size planning is also provided.

In observational studies, however, any detected association between treatment ("on-medication" vs "off-medication") and the outcome (performance in the activity) might be due to confounders. In particular, causal inferences at the personalized level are especially vulnerable to confounding effects that arise in a cyclic fashion. For quick acting medications, effects can be confounded by circadian rhythms and daily routines. Using the time-of-the-day as a surrogate for these confounders and the performance measurements as captured on a smartphone, we propose a personalized statistical approach to disentangle putative treatment and "time-of-the-day" effects, that leverages conditional independence relations spanned by causal graphical models involving the treatment, time-of-the-day, and outcome variables. Our approach is based on conditional independence tests implemented via standard and temporal linear regression models. Using synthetic data, we investigate when and how residual autocorrelation can affect the standard tests, and how time series modeling (namely, ARIMA and robust regression via HAC covariance matrix estimators) can remedy these issues. In particular, our simulations illustrate that when patients perform their activities in a paired fashion, positive autocorrelation can lead to conservative results for the standard regression approach (i.e., lead to deflated true positive detection), whereas negative autocorrelation can lead to anticonservative behavior (i.e., lead to inflated false positive detection). The adoption of time series methods, on the other hand, leads to well controlled type I error rates. We illustrate the application of our methodology with data from a Parkinson's disease mobile health study.

Here, the authors develop a framework based on natural language processing to uncover interpretable potential confounders from text. Randomized clinical trials (RCT) are the gold standard for informing treatment decisions. Observational studies are often plagued by selection bias, and expert-selected covariates may insufficiently adjust for confounding. We explore how unstructured clinical text can be used to reduce selection bias and improve medical practice. We develop a framework based on natural language processing to uncover interpretable potential confounders from text. We validate our method by comparing the estimated hazard ratio (HR) with and without the confounders against established RCTs. We apply our method to four cohorts built from localized prostate and lung cancer datasets from the Stanford Cancer Institute and show that our method shifts the HR estimate towards the RCT results. The uncovered terms can also be interpreted by oncologists for clinical insights. We present this proof-of-concept study to enable more credible causal inference using observational data, uncover meaningful insights from clinical text, and inform high-stakes medical decisions.

This cross-sectional study enrolled 1368 participants from April 2015 to May 2017. Trained research investigators interviewed farmers using a self-administered questionnaire. Logistic regression and DAG models were used to identify the associations between CHD and chronic pesticide exposure. A total of 150 (11.0%) of the 1368 participants are characterized as having CHD. High pesticide exposure (odds ratio=2.852, 95% confidence intervals: 1.951-4.171) is associated with CHD when compare with low pesticide exposure by both DAG and logistic analyses. After adjusting for the additional potential influence of factors identified by the DAG analysis, there is no significant association, such as the results in logistic regression: ethnicity, education level, settlement time, and mixed pesticide status. Specifically, age, meal frequency, and consumption of fresh fruit, according to the DAG analysis, are independent factors for CHD. High pesticide exposure is a risk factor for CHD as indicated by both DAG and logistic regression analyses. DAG can be a preferable improvement over traditional regression methods to identify sources of bias and causal inference in observational studies, especially for complex research questions.

Methods: Using five waves of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (2013-2019), we estimated marginal structural models with inverse probability of treatment and censoring weights to examine the association between time-varying e-cigarette initiation and subsequent cigarette smoking initiation among e-cigarette- and cigarette-naive youth (12-17 years) at baseline. Time-dependent confounders used as predictors in inverse probability weights included tobacco-related attitudes or beliefs, mental health symptoms, substance use, and tobacco-marketing exposure. Results: Among 9,584 youth at baseline, those who initiated e-cigarettes were 2.4 times as likely to subsequently initiate cigarette smoking as youth who did not initiate e-cigarettes (risk ratio - 2.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.1, 2.7), after accounting for timedependent confounding and selection bias. Among youth who initiated e-cigarettes, more frequent vaping was associated with greater risk of smoking initiation (risk ratio >= 3 days/month - 1.8, 95% CI = 1.4, 2.2; 1-2 days/month = 1.2; 95% CI = 0.93, 1.6 vs. 0 days/month). Weighted marginal structural model estimates were moderately attenuated compared with unweighted estimates adjusted for baseline-only confounders. At the US population level, we estimated over half a million youth initiated cigarette smoking because of prior e-cigarette use over follow-up. Conclusions: The association between youth vaping and combustible cigarette smoking persisted after accounting for time-dependent confounding. We estimate that e-cigarette use accounts for a considerable share of cigarette initiation among US youth. See video abstract at, http://links.lww.com/EDE/B937.

Approaches to addressing missing values, measurement error, and confounding in epidemiologic studies	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Data analysis; Confounding; Measurement error; Missing data; Simulation; Regression calibration; Imputation; Regression	MULTIPLE-IMPUTATION; CAUSAL INFERENCE; BIG DATA	Objectives: Epidemiologic studies often suffer from incomplete data, measurement error (or misclassification), and confounding. Each of these can cause bias and imprecision in estimates of exposure-outcome relations. We describe and compare statistical approaches that aim to control all three sources of bias simultaneously. Study Design and Setting: We illustrate four statistical approaches that address all three sources of bias, namely, multiple imputation for missing data and measurement error, multiple imputation combined with regression calibration, full information maximum likelihood within a structural equation modeling framework, and a Bayesian model. In a simulation study, we assess the performance of the four approaches compared with more commonly used approaches that do not account for measurement error, missing values, or confounding. Results: The results demonstrate that the four approaches consistently outperform the alternative approaches on all performance metrics (bias, mean squared error, and confidence interval coverage). Even in simulated data of 100 subjects, these approaches perform well. Conclusion: There can be a large benefit of addressing measurement error, missing values, and confounding to improve the estimation of exposure-outcome relations, even when the available sample size is relatively small.

Summary statistic analyses can mistake confounding bias for heritability	GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						GWAS; heritability estimation; misspecified models	GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; LD SCORE REGRESSION; LINEAR MIXED-MODEL; GENETIC CORRELATION; SNP HERITABILITY; COMPLEX TRAITS; VARIANTS; ARCHITECTURE; LOCI	Linkage disequilibrium SCore regression (LDSC) has become a popular approach to estimate confounding bias, heritability, and genetic correlation using only genome-wide association study (GWAS) test statistics. SumHer is a newly introduced alternative with similar aims. We show using theory and simulations that both approaches fail to adequately account for confounding bias, even when the assumed heritability model is correct. Consequently, these methods may estimate heritability poorly if there was an inadequate adjustment for confounding in the original GWAS analysis. We also show that the choice of a summary statistic for use in LDSC or SumHer can have a large impact on resulting inferences. Further, covariate adjustments in the original GWAS can alter the target of heritability estimation, which can be problematic for test statistics from a meta-analysis of GWAS with different covariate adjustments.

J	Marques, I; Kneib, T; Klein, N				Marques, Isa; Kneib, Thomas; Klein, Nadja			Mitigating spatial confounding by explicitly correlating Gaussian random fields	ENVIRONMETRICS			English	Article						Bayesian inference; penalized complexity prior; spatial statistics; stochastic partial differential equation	MARKOV RANDOM-FIELDS; MODELS	Spatial models are used in a variety of research areas, such as environmental sciences, epidemiology, or physics. A common phenomenon in such spatial regression models is spatial confounding. This phenomenon is observed when spatially indexed covariates modeling the mean of the response are correlated with a spatial random effect included in the model, for example, as a proxy of unobserved spatial confounders. As a result, estimates for regression coefficients of the covariates can be severely biased and interpretation of these is no longer valid. Recent literature has shown that typical solutions for reducing spatial confounding can lead to misleading and counterintuitive results. In this article, we develop a computationally efficient spatial model that explicitly correlates a Gaussian random field for the covariate of interest with the Gaussian random field in the main model equation and integrates novel prior structures to reduce spatial confounding. Starting from the univariate case, we extend our prior structure also to the case of multiple spatially confounded covariates. In simulation studies, we show that our novel model flexibly detects and reduces spatial confounding in spatial datasets, and it performs better than typically used methods such as restricted spatial regression. These results are promising for any applied researcher who wishes to interpret covariate effects in spatial regression models. As a real data illustration, we study the effect of elevation and temperature on the mean of monthly precipitation in Germany.

J	Bender, R; Blettner, M				Bender, R; Blettner, M			Calculating the "number needed to be exposed" with adjustment for confounding variables in epidemiological studies	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						confounding; confidence intervals; epidemiology; logistic regression; number needed to treat; odds ratio; statistics	LOGISTIC-REGRESSION MODELS; ABSOLUTE RISK REDUCTION; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; TREAT; STATISTICS; TRIALS	The number needed to treat (NNT) is a popular summary statistic to describe the absolute effect of a new treatment compared with a standard treatment or control concerning the risk of an adverse event. The NNT concept can be applied whenever the risk of an adverse event is compared between two groups; for the comparison of exposed with unexposed subjects in epidemiological studies, we propose the term "number needed to be exposed" (NINE). Whereas in randomized clinical trials NNT can be calculated on the basis of a simple 2x2 table, in epidemiological studies methods to adjust for confounders are required in most applications. We derive a method based upon multiple logistic regression analysis to pet-form point and interval estimation of NNE with adjustment for confounding variables. The adjusted NNE can be calculated from the adjusted odds ratio (OR) and the unexposed event rate (UER) estimated by means of an appropriate multiple logistic regression model. As UER is dependent on the confounders, the adjusted NNEs also vary with the values of the confounding variables. Two methods are proposed to take the dependence of NNE on the values of the confounders into account. The adjusted number needed to be exposed can be a useful complement to the commonly presented results in epidemiological studies, such as ORs and attributable risks. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Intermediate confounding in trio relationships: The importance of complete data in effect size estimation	GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						bias; confounding; maternal effect; paternal effect; trio		We present an important characteristic of trio models which may lead to bias and loss of power when one parent is unmodeled in trio analyses. Motivated by recent interest in estimating parental effects on postnatal and later-life phenotypes, we consider a causal model where each parent has both an effect on their child's phenotype which is mediated through the genotype transmitted to the child and a direct effect on the phenotype through the parentally provided environment. We derive the power and bias of models in which one parent's genotype is not modeled, showing that while the effect of the child's genotype is biased in the direction of the unmodeled parent's effect as expected, the estimated effect of the observed parent's genotype is also biased in the opposite direction. While this phenomenon may not be intuitive under the assumption of random mating, it can be explained by intermediate confounding of the child's genotype-phenotype effect. These observations have implications for the accurate estimation of maternal and paternal effects in trio data sets with missing genotype data.

We assessed the impact of omitting confounders from a PS analysis on clinical decision making. Study Design and Setting: We conducted Monte Carlo simulations on hypothetical observational studies based on virtual populations and on the population from a large randomized trial (CRASH-2). In both series of simulations, PS analysis was conducted with all confounders and with omitted confounders, which were defined to have different strengths of association with the outcome and treatment exposure. After inverse probability of treatment weighting, we calculated the absolute risk differences and numbers needed to treat (NNT). Results: In both series of simulations, omitting a confounder that was moderately associated with the outcome and exposure led to negligible bias on the NNT scale. The bias induced by omitting strongly positive confounding variables remained less than 15 patients to treat. Major bias and reversed effects were found only when omitting highly prevalent, strongly negative confounders that were similarly associated with the outcome and exposure with odds ratios greater than 4.00 (or <0.25). This omission was accompanied by a substantial decrease in analysis power. Conclusion: The omission of strongly negative confounding variables from a PS analysis can lead to incorrect clinical decision making. However, omitting these variables also decreases the analysis power, which may prevent the reporting of significant but misleading effects. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	le Cessie, S				le Cessie, Saskia			Bias Formulas for Estimating Direct and Indirect Effects When Unmeasured Confounding Is Present	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							MEDIATION ANALYSIS; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; MEASUREMENT-ERROR; MISCLASSIFICATION	Mediation analysis examines the influence of intermediate factors in the causal pathway between an exposure and an outcome. It yields estimates of the direct effect of the exposure on the outcome and of the indirect effect through the intermediate variable. Both estimates can be biased if the relationship between the mediator and the outcome is confounded. In this article, we study the effect of unmeasured confounding on direct and indirect effect estimates for a continuous mediator and an outcome that may be either binary, count, or continuous. We formulate the effect of the confounder on the intermediate and on the outcome directly in regression models, which makes the formulas intuitive to use by applied users. The formulas are derived under the assumption that the confounder follows a normal distribution. In simulations, the formulas for a linear response model performed well, also as it did when the unmeasured confounder was binary. For a rare binary outcome, the formulas for logistic regression performed well if the unmeasured confounder followed a normal distribution, but for a binary confounder the bias in the direct effect was overcorrected. We applied the formulas to data from a case-control study (Leiden Thrombophilia Study) on risk factors for venous thrombosis. This showed that unmeasured confounding can severely bias the estimates of direct and indirect effects.

Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting and Confounder Missingness in Electronic Health Record-based Analyses: A Comparison of Approaches Using Plasmode Simulation	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Comparative effectiveness research; Data quality; Electronic health records; Inverse probability of treatment weighting; Missing data; Propensity scores; Statistical bias	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; PROPENSITY SCORE; MEASUREMENT-ERROR; REGRESSION CALIBRATION; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; SURVIVAL; TIME; CARE	Background:Electronic health record (EHR) data represent a critical resource for comparative effectiveness research, allowing investigators to study intervention effects in real-world settings with large patient samples. However, high levels of missingness in confounder variables is common, challenging the perceived validity of EHR-based investigations. Methods:We investigated performance of multiple imputation and propensity score (PS) calibration when conducting inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW)-based comparative effectiveness research using EHR data with missingness in confounder variables and outcome misclassification. Our motivating example compared effectiveness of immunotherapy versus chemotherapy treatment of advanced bladder cancer with missingness in a key prognostic variable. We captured complexity in EHR data structures using a plasmode simulation approach to spike investigator-defined effects into resamples of a cohort of 4361 patients from a nationwide deidentified EHR-derived database. We characterized statistical properties of IPTW hazard ratio estimates when using multiple imputation or PS calibration missingness approaches. Results:Multiple imputation and PS calibration performed similarly, maintaining <= 0.05 absolute bias in the marginal hazard ratio even when >= 50% of subjects had missing at random or missing not at random confounder data. Multiple imputation required greater computational resources, taking nearly 40 times as long as PS calibration to complete. Outcome misclassification minimally increased bias of both methods. Conclusion:Our results support multiple imputation and PS calibration approaches to missingness in missing completely at random or missing at random confounder variables in EHR-based IPTW comparative effectiveness analyses, even with missingness >= 50%.

Adjusting for unmeasured confounding in nonrandomized longitudinal studies: a methodological review	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Review						Method review; Unmeasured confounding; Unobserved confounding; Longitudinal; Observational data; Electronic health records	PROPENSITY SCORE METHODS; PANEL-DATA; BIAS; ADJUSTMENT; MODELS	Objectives: Motivated by recent calls to use electronic health records for research, we reviewed the application and development of methods for addressing the bias from unmeasured confounding in longitudinal data. Study Design and Setting: Methodological review of existing literature. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for articles addressing the threat to causal inference from unmeasured confounding in nonrandomized longitudinal health data through quasi-experimental analysis. Results: Among the 121 studies included for review, 84 used instrumental variable analysis (IVA), of which 36 used lagged or historical instruments. Difference-in-differences (DiD) and fixed effects (FE) models were found in 29 studies. Five of these combined IVA with DiD or FE to try to mitigate for time-dependent confounding. Other less frequently used methods included prior event rate ratio adjustment, regression discontinuity nested within pre-post studies, propensity score calibration, perturbation analysis, and negative control outcomes. Conclusion: Well-established econometric methods such as DiD and IVA are commonly used to address unmeasured confounding in nonrandomized longitudinal studies, but researchers often fail to take full advantage of available longitudinal information. A range of promising new methods have been developed, but further studies are needed to understand their relative performance in different contexts before they can be recommended for widespread use.

In such studies, the mediation process may flow through the student-level mediator (the within indirect effect) or a class-aggregated mediator (the contextual indirect effect). In this article, we cast mediation analysis within the counterfactual framework and clarify the assumptions that are needed to identify the within and contextual indirect effect. We show that unlike the contextual indirect effect, the within indirect effect can be unbiasedly estimated in linear models in the presence of unmeasured confounders of the mediator-outcome relationship at the upper level that exert additive effects on mediator and outcome. When unmeasured confounding occurs at the individual level, both indirect effects are no longer identified. We propose sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the within and contextual indirect effect under lower and upper-level confounding, respectively.

The key challenge on estimating treatment effect in the wild observational studies is to handle confounding bias induced by imbalance of the confounder distributions between treated and control units. Traditional methods remove confounding bias by re-weighting units with supposedly accurate propensity score estimation under the unconfoundedness assumption. Controlling high-dimensional variables may make the unconfoundedness assumption more plausible, but poses new challenge on accurate propensity score estimation. One strand of recent literature seeks to directly optimize weights to balance confounder distributions, bypassing propensity score estimation. But existing balancing methods fail to do selection and differentiation among the pool of a large number of potential confounders, leading to possible underperformance inmany high-dimensional settings. In this article, we propose a data-driven Differentiated Confounder Balancing (DCB) algorithm to jointly select confounders, differentiate weights of confounders and balance confounder distributions for treatment effect estimation in the wild high-dimensional settings. Besides, under some settings with heavy confounding bias, in order to further reduce the bias and variance of estimated treatment effect, we propose a Regression Adjusted Differentiated Confounder Balancing (RADCB) algorithm based on our DCB algorithm by incorporating outcome regression adjustment. The synergistic learning algorithms we proposed are more capable of reducing the confounding bias in many observational studies. To validate the effectiveness of our DCB and RA-DCB algorithms, we conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that our algorithms outperform the state-of-the-art methods. By incorporating regression adjustment, our RA-DCB algorithm achieves more precise estimation on treatment effect than DCB algorithm, especially under the settings with heavy confounding bias. Moreover, we show that the top features ranked by our algorithm generate accurate prediction of online advertising effect.

EXTENDED SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS FOR HETEROGENEOUS UNMEASURED CONFOUNDING WITH AN APPLICATION TO SIBLING STUDIES OF RETURNS TO EDUCATION	ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Observational studies; causal inference; nuisance parameters; quadratic programming; hidden bias; superpopulation inference	BIAS; CONFIDENCE; DESIGNS; TESTS	The conventional model for assessing insensitivity to hidden bias in paired observational studies constructs a worst-case distribution for treatment assignments subject to bounds on the maximal bias to which any given pair is subjected. In studies where rare cases of extreme hidden bias are suspected, the maximal bias may be substantially larger than the typical bias across pairs, such that a correctly specified bound on the maximal bias would yield an unduly pessimistic perception of the study's robustness to hidden bias. We present an extended sensitivity analysis which allows researchers to simultaneously bound the maximal and typical bias perturbing the pairs under investigation while maintaining the desired Type I error rate. We motivate and illustrate our method with two sibling studies on the impact of schooling on earnings, one containing information of cognitive ability of siblings and the other not. Cognitive ability, clearly influential of both earnings and degree of schooling, is likely similar between members of most sibling pairs yet could, conceivably, vary drastically for some siblings. The method is straightforward to implement, simply requiring the solution to a quadratic program. R code is provided in the Supplementary Material.

In our model, there are L observed contexts and K arms of the bandit. The observed context influences the reward obtained through a latent confounder variable with cardinality m (m << L,K). The arm choice and the latent confounder causally determines the reward while the observed context is correlated with the confounder. Under this model, the L x K mean reward matrix U (for each context in [L] and each arm in [K]) factorizes into non-negative factors A (L x m) and W (m x K). This insight enables us to propose an epsilon-greedy NMF-Bandit algorithm that designs a sequence of interventions (selecting specific arms), that achieves a balance between learning this low-dimensional structure and selecting the best arm to minimize regret. Our algorithm achieves a regret of O (Lpoly(m, log K) log T) at time T, as compared to O(LK log T) for conventional contextual bandits, assuming a constant gap between the best arm and the rest for each context. These guarantees are obtained under mild sufficiency conditions on the factors that are weaker versions of the well-known Statistical RIP condition. We further propose a class of generative models that satisfy our sufficient conditions, and derive a lower bound of O (Km log T). These are the first regret guarantees for online matrix completion with bandit feedback, when the rank is greater than one. We further compare the performance of our algorithm with the state of the art, on synthetic and real world data-sets.

Sharp sensitivity bounds for mediation under unmeasured mediator-outcome confounding	BIOMETRIKA			English	Article						Bounding factor; Causal inference; Collider; Natural direct effect; Natural indirect effect	NATURAL DIRECT; LUNG-CANCER; IDENTIFICATION; SMOKING; MODELS	It is often of interest to decompose the total effect of an exposure into a component that acts on the outcome through some mediator and a component that acts independently through other pathways. Said another way, we are interested in the direct and indirect effects of the exposure on the outcome. Even if the exposure is randomly assigned, it is often infeasible to randomize the mediator, leaving the mediator-outcome confounding not fully controlled. We develop a sensitivity analysis technique that can bound the direct and indirect effects without parametric assumptions about the unmeasured mediator-outcome confounding.

Analyses were conducted in 2687 participants of a German, population-based cohort of older adults with data collection 2008-2010. Polypharmacy was defined as >= 5 drugs and hyperpolypharmacy as >= 10 drugs. Drugs without relevant propensity of causing adverse drug reactions or drug-drug interactions were not counted. Confounding by indication was addressed by model adjustment for a propensity score for polypharmacy. The median age of study participants was 70 years, 10.7% had multi-morbidity, and 47.4% took five drugs or more (8.6% took >= 10 drugs). During 4.4 years of follow-up, 87 participants died of a cause other than cancer. Statistically significant, more than twofold increased non-cancer mortality was observed for subjects with polypharmacy or hyperpolypharmacy in a model adjusted for age, sex, education, lifestyle variables, and comorbidity, but associations lost statistical significance after additional adjustment for a propensity score for polypharmacy. However, a significant interaction of hyperpolypharmacy and multi-morbidity was detected (p = 0.019). The hazard ratio for the association of hyperpolypharmacy with non-cancer mortality was 1.42 (95%CI 0.57; 3.57) in subjects without multi-morbidity and 0.51 (95%CI 0.11; 2.27) in subjects with multi-morbidity. Polypharmacy was not independently associated with non-cancer mortality. This study highlights the importance to adjust for confounding by indication in studies on polypharmacy by a propensity score. The detected interaction suggests that hyperpolypharmacy can be indicated in subjects with multi-morbidity and may only be harmful in subjects without multi-morbidity.

We use microdata collected by the Italian National Statistical Office for the year 2009 during a multi-scope survey of Italian households. The employment-obesity relationship is estimated after controlling for observed confounding by using probit regression and a propensity score weighting approach. To control for both observed and unobserved confounding (endogeneity), a semiparametric recursive bivariate probit model is employed instead. Our findings suggest that obesity has a significant negative effect on the employment probability and that endogeneity might not be an important issue.

The influence of cluster-constant confounders can be eliminated by studying the exposure-outcome association within (conditional on) clusters, but additional regression modeling is usually required to control for observed cluster-varying confounders. A problem is that the working regression model may be misspecified, in which case the estimated within-cluster association may be biased. To reduce sensitivity to model misspecification we propose to augment the standard working model for the outcome with an auxiliary working model for the exposure. We derive a doubly robust conditional generalized estimating equation (DRCGEE) estimator for the within-cluster association. This estimator combines the two models in such a way that it is consistent if either model is correct, not necessarily both. Thus, the DRCGEE estimator gives the researcher two chances instead of only one to make valid inference on the within-cluster association. We have implemented the estimator in an R package and we use it to examine the association between smoking during pregnancy and cognitive abilities in offspring, in a sample of siblings.

Interpreting population- and family-based genome-wide association studies in the presence of confounding	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							GENOTYPE-PHENOTYPE ASSOCIATIONS; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; STRATIFICATION; HERITABILITY; ADMIXTURE; SELECTION; HISTORY; MODEL; RISK	A central aim of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) is to estimate direct genetic effects: the causal effects on an individual's phenotype of the alleles that they carry. However, estimates of direct effects can be subject to genetic and environmental confounding and can also absorb the "indirect" genetic effects of relatives' genotypes. Recently, an important development in controlling for these confounds has been the use of within-family GWASs, which, because of the randomness of mendelian segregation within pedigrees, are often interpreted as producing unbiased estimates of direct effects. Here, we present a general theoretical analysis of the influence of confounding in standard population-based and within-family GWASs. We show that, contrary to common interpretation, family-based estimates of direct effects can be biased by genetic confounding. In humans, such biases will often be small per-locus, but can be compounded when effect-size estimates are used in polygenic scores (PGSs). We illustrate the influence of genetic confounding on population- and family-based estimates of direct effects using models of assortative mating, population stratification, and stabilizing selection on GWAS traits. We further show how family-based estimates of indirect genetic effects, based on comparisons of parentally transmitted and untransmitted alleles, can suffer substantial genetic confounding. We conclude that, while family-based studies have placed GWAS estimation on a more rigorous footing, they carry subtle issues of interpretation that arise from confounding. GWASs aim to estimate direct effects of genotype on an individual's phenotype, but this can be subject to genetic and environmental confounds and "indirect" genetic effects of relatives' genotypes. This study presents a theoretical analysis of the influence of confounders in population-based and within-family GWASs, showing that, while family-based studies are more rigorous, they still carry subtle issues that arise from confounding.

Confounding Effects of Phase Delays on Causality Estimation	PLOS ONE			English	Article							STATISTICAL ASSESSMENT; GRANGER CAUSALITY; EEG; SYNCHRONIZATION; CONNECTIVITY	Linear and non-linear techniques for inferring causal relations between the brain signals representing the underlying neuronal systems have become a powerful tool to extract the connectivity patterns in the brain. Typically these tools employ the idea of Granger causality, which is ultimately based on the temporal precedence between the signals. At the same time, phase synchronization between coupled neural ensembles is considered a mechanism implemented in the brain to integrate relevant neuronal ensembles to perform a cognitive or perceptual task. Phase synchronization can be studied by analyzing the effects of phase-locking between the brain signals. However, we should expect that there is no one-to-one mapping between the observed phase lag and the time precedence as specified by physically interacting systems. Specifically, phase lag observed between two signals may interfere with inferring causal relations. This could be of critical importance for the coupled non-linear oscillating systems, with possible time delays in coupling, when classical linear cross-spectrum strategies for solving phase ambiguity are not efficient. To demonstrate this, we used a prototypical model of coupled non-linear systems, and compared three typical pipelines of inferring Granger causality, as established in the literature. Specifically, we compared the performance of the spectral and information-theoretic Granger pipelines as well as standard Granger causality in their relations to the observed phase differences for frequencies at which the signals become synchronized to each other. We found that an information-theoretic approach, which takes into account different time lags between the past of one signal and the future of another signal, was the most robust to phase effects.

Using examples from large health care database studies, this article provides the clinicians with an overview of standard methods in the analysis phase, such as stratification, standardization, multivariable regression analysis and propensity score (PS) methods, together with the more advanced high-dimensional propensity score (HD-PS) method. We describe the progression from simple stratification confined to the inclusion of a few potential confounders to complex modeling procedures such as the HD-PS approach by which hundreds of potential confounders are extracted from large health care databases. Stratification and standardization assist in the understanding of the data at a detailed level, while accounting for potential confounders. Incorporating several potential confounders in the analysis typically implies the choice between multivariable analysis and PS methods. Although PS methods have gained remarkable popularity in recent years, there is an ongoing discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of PS methods as compared to those of multivariable analysis. Furthermore, the HD-PS method, despite its generous inclusion of potential confounders, is also associated with potential pitfalls. All methods are dependent on the assumption of no unknown, unmeasured and residual confounding and suffer from the difficulty of identifying true confounders. Even in large health care databases, insufficient or poor data may contribute to these challenges. The trend in data collection is to compile more fine-grained data on lifestyle and severity of diseases, based on self-reporting and modern technologies. This will surely improve our ability to incorporate relevant confounders or their proxies. However, despite a remarkable development of methods that account for confounding and new data opportunities, confounding will remain a serious issue. Considering the advantages and disadvantages of different methods, we emphasize the importance of the clinical input and of the interplay between clinicians and analysts to ensure a proper analysis.

The authors review and derive a set of parallel simple formulas for bias factors in the risk difference, risk ratio, and odds ratio from studies with an unmeasured polytomous confounder and a dichotomous exposure and outcome. METHODS: The authors show how the bias formulas are related to and are sometimes simpler than earlier formulas. The article contains three examples, including a Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis of a preadjusted or conditional estimate. RESULTS: All the bias expressions can be given parallel formulations as the difference or ratio of (i) the Sum across confounder strata of each exposure-stratified confounder-outcome effect measure multiplied by the confounder prevalences among the exposed and (ii) the sum across confounder strata of the same effect measure multiplied by the confounder prevalences among the unexposed. The basic formulas can be applied to scenarios with a polytomous confounder, exposure, or outcome. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to aiding design and analysis strategies for confounder control, the bias for, mulas provide a link between classical standardization decompositions of demography and classical bias formulas of epidemiology. They are also useful in constructing general programs for sensitivity analysis and more elaborate probabilistic risk analyses.

Challenging the utility of polygenic scores for social science: Environmental confounding, downward causation, and unknown biology	BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Editorial Material						behavior genetics; environmental confounding; gene-environment correlation; genetic heterogeneity; GWAS; human potential; polygenic scores; population stratification; sociogenomics; statistical genetics	HERITABILITY	The sociogenomics revolution is upon us, we are told. Whether revolutionary or not, sociogenomics is poised to flourish given the ease of incorporating polygenic scores (or PGSs) as "genetic propensities" for complex traits into social science research. Pointing to evidence of ubiquitous heritability and the accessibility of genetic data, scholars have argued that social scientists not only have an opportunity but a duty to add PGSs to social science research. Social science research that ignores genetics is, some proponents argue, at best partial and likely scientifically flawed, misleading, and wasteful. Here, I challenge arguments about the value of genetics for social science and with it the claimed necessity of incorporating PGSs into social science models as measures of genetic influences. In so doing, I discuss the impracticability of distinguishing genetic influences from environmental influences because of non-causal gene-environment correlations, especially population stratification, familial confounding, and downward causation. I explain how environmental effects masquerade as genetic influences in PGSs, which undermines their raison d'etre as measures of genetic propensity, especially for complex socially contingent behaviors that are the subject of sociogenomics. Additionally, I draw attention to the partial, unknown biology, while highlighting the persistence of an implicit, unavoidable reductionist genes versus environments approach. Leaving sociopolitical and ethical concerns aside, I argue that the potential scientific rewards of adding PGSs to social science are few and greatly overstated and the scientific costs, which include obscuring structural disadvantages and cultural influences, outweigh these meager benefits for most social science applications.

Challenging the utility of polygenic scores for social science: Environmental confounding, downward causation, and unknown biology	BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						behavior genetics; environmental confounding; gene-environment correlation; genetic heterogeneity; GWAS; human potential; polygenic scores; population stratification; sociogenomics; statistical genetics	GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; SCALE GENETIC-STRUCTURE; STRUCTURAL VARIATION; MISSING HERITABILITY; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; PREDICTION; RISK; RARE; STRATIFICATION; EXPLANATION	The sociogenomics revolution is upon us, we are told. Whether revolutionary or not, sociogenomics is poised to flourish given the ease of incorporating polygenic scores (or PGSs) as "genetic propensities" for complex traits into social science research. Pointing to evidence of ubiquitous heritability and the accessibility of genetic data, scholars have argued that social scientists not only have an opportunity but a duty to add PGSs to social science research. Social science research that ignores genetics is, some proponents argue, at best partial and likely scientifically flawed, misleading, and wasteful. Here, I challenge arguments about the value of genetics for social science and with it the claimed necessity of incorporating PGSs into social science models as measures of genetic influences. In so doing, I discuss the impracticability of distinguishing genetic influences from environmental influences because of non-causal gene-environment correlations, especially population stratification, familial confounding, and downward causation. I explain how environmental effects masquerade as genetic influences in PGSs, which undermines their raison d'etre as measures of genetic propensity, especially for complex socially contingent behaviors that are the subject of sociogenomics. Additionally, I draw attention to the partial, unknown biology, while highlighting the persistence of an implicit, unavoidable reductionist genes versus environments approach. Leaving sociopolitical and ethical concerns aside, I argue that the potential scientific rewards of adding PGSs to social science are few and greatly overstated and the scientific costs, which include obscuring structural disadvantages and cultural influences, outweigh these meager benefits for most social science applications.

J	Landeiro, V; Culotta, A				Landeiro, Virgile; Culotta, Aron			Robust Text Classification under Confounding Shift	JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH			English	Article							PROPENSITY SCORE	As statistical classifiers become integrated into real-world applications, it is important to consider not only their accuracy but also their robustness to changes in the data distribution. Although identifying and controlling for confounding variables Z - correlated with both the input X of a classifier and its output Y - has been assiduously studied in empirical social science, it is often neglected in text classification. This can be understood by the fact that, if we assume that the impact of confounding variables does not change between the time we fit a model and the time we use it, then prediction accuracy should only be slightly affected. We show in this paper that this assumption often does not hold and that when the influence of a confounding variable changes from training time to prediction time (i.e. under confounding shift), the classifier accuracy can degrade rapidly. We use Pearl's back-door adjustment as a predictive framework to develop a model robust to confounding shift under the condition that Z is observed at training time. Our approach does not make any causal conclusions but by experimenting on 6 datasets, we show that our approach is able to outperform baselines 1) in controlled cases where confounding shift is manually injected between fitting time and prediction time 2) in natural experiments where confounding shift appears either abruptly or gradually 3) in cases where there is one or multiple confounders. Finally, we discuss multiple issues we encountered during this research such as the effect of noise in the observation of Z and the importance of only controlling for confounding variables.

Meta-analysis of lung cancer in asphalt roofing and paving workers with external adjustment for confounding by coal tar	JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HYGIENE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Health Effects of Occupational Exposure to Emissions from Asphalt/Bitumen Symposium	JUN 07-08, 2006	BG Acad Occupat Hlth & Safety, Dresden, GERMANY	ACGIH, Commiss Invest Hlth Hazards Chem Compounds Work Area, DFG	BG Acad Occupat Hlth & Safety	meta-analysis; confounding; asphalt; coal tar; epidemiology; lung cancer	BITUMEN FUME; AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; MORTALITY; RISK; EXPOSURE; COHORT; OCCUPATION; SMOKING; CARCINOGENICITY; ROOFERS	The study's objectives were to update Partanen's and Boffetta's 1994 meta- analysis of lung cancer among roofing and paving asphalt workers and explore the role of coal tar in explaining the statistical heterogeneity among these studies. Information retrieval strategies and eligibility criteria were defined for identifying the epidemiologic studies to be included in the analysis. The relative risk ratio ( RR) for lung cancer was selected as the effect measure of interest. Coal tar bias factors were developed and used to externally adjust each eligible study's published RR for confounding by coal tar. Confidence intervals on adjusted RRs were estimated by the Monte Carlo methods outlined by Steenland and Greenland ( 2004). The meta- Relative Risk ( meta- RR) and its variance were estimated by general variance- based methods. Heterogeneity of the RRs was assessed by heterogeneity chisquare and I-2 tests. Also explored were the influences of study design; differences between internally and externally adjusted RRs; and the potential impact of coal tar misclassification. The results from this update were similar to those in Partanen's and Boffetta's original meta- analysis. The unadjusted metaRR ( random effects model) for the roofing studies was elevated ( meta- RR= 1.67, 95% CI = 1.39 - 2.02, I-2 = 80%) and significantly greater than the meta- RR for the paving studies ( meta RR=0.98, 95% CI = 0.81 - 1.18, I-2 = 59%). After adjustment for confounding by coal tar, however, the corrected roofers' meta- RR dropped to 1.10 ( meta- RR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.91 1.33, I-2 = 60%), while the corrected pavers' meta- RR was nearly unchanged at 0.96 ( meta- RR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.80 1.16, I-2 = 56%). Although the meta- RRs for the roofers and the pavers were no longer statistically significantly different from one another, significant heterogeneity remained within each of the coal tar- adjusted sectors. Stratifying the roofing and paving studies by study design revealed that statistical heterogeneity was concentrated in the weaker designs such as those relying on death certificates for work history. When the weaker studies were excluded, the remaining roofing and paving studies had a combined meta- RR close to 1.0 ( meta- RR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.88 - 1.17) with no significant heterogeneity ( I-2 = 0%). Meta- analysis of non- experimental epidemiologic studies is subject to significant uncertainties as is externally correcting studies for confounding. Given these uncertainties, the specific quantitative estimates in this ( or any similar) analysis must be viewed with caution. Nevertheless, this analysis provides support for the hypothesis proposed by several major reviewers that confounding by coal tar- related PAH exposures may explain most or all of the lung cancer risks found in the epidemiologic literature on asphalt roofing and paving workers.

Study Design and Setting: In each example, we constructed a concurrent cohort of new and old drug initiators using US claims databases. In historical cohorts of old drug initiators, we developed hdDRS models including investigator-specified plus empirically identified variables and using principal component analysis and lasso regression for dimension reduction. We applied the models to the concurrent cohorts to obtain predicted outcome probabilities, which we used for confounding adjustment. We compared the resulting estimates to those from hdPS. Results: The crude odds ratio (OR) comparing dabigatran to warfarin was 0.52 (95% confidence interval: 0.37-0.72) for hemorrhage and 0.38 (0.26-0.55) for death. Decile stratification yielded an OR of 0.64 (0.46-0.90) for hemorrhage using hdDRS vs. 0.70 (0.49-1.02) for hdPS. ORs for death were 0.69 (0.45-1.06) and 0.73 (0.48-1.10), respectively. The relative performance of hdDRS in the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors example was similar. Conclusion: hdDRS achieved similar or better confounding adjustment compared to conventional regression approach but worked slightly less well than hdPS. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, these eQTL studies may suffer from low or moderate statistical power and overly conservative false-discovery rate. In practice, most algorithms for eQTL identification do not model the joint effects of multiple genetic variants with weak or moderate influence. Here we present a novel machine-learning algorithm, lasso least-squares kernel machine (LSKM-LASSO) that model the association between multiple genetic variants and phenotypic traits simultaneously with the existence of nongenetic and genetic confounding. With a more general and flexible framework for the estimation of genetic confounding, LSKM-LASSO is able to provide a more accurate evaluation of the joint effects of multiple genetic variants. Our simulations demonstrate that our approach outperforms three state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of eQTL identification and phenotype prediction. We then apply our method to genotype and gene expression data of 11 tissues obtained from the Genotype-Tissue Expression project. Our algorithm was able to identify more genes with eQTL than other algorithms. By incorporating a regularization term and combining it with least-squares kernel machine, LSKM-LASSO provides a powerful tool for eQTL mapping and phenotype prediction.

J	Jackson, JW				Jackson, John W.			Diagnostics for Confounding of Time-varying and Other Joint Exposures	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; SELECTION BIAS; DIAGRAMS; OUTCOMES; WEIGHTS	The effects of joint exposures (or exposure regimes) include those of adhering to assigned treatment versus placebo in a randomized controlled trial, duration of exposure in a cohort study, interactions between exposures, and direct effects of exposure, among others. Unlike the setting of a single point exposure (e.g., propensity score matching), there are few tools to describe confounding for joint exposures or how well a method resolves it. Investigators need tools that describe confounding in ways that are conceptually grounded and intuitive for those who read, review, and use applied research to guide policy. We revisit the implications of exchangeability conditions that hold in sequentially randomized trials, and the bias structure that motivates the use of g-methods, such as marginal structural models. From these, we develop covariate balance diagnostics for joint exposures that can (1) describe time-varying confounding, (2) assess whether covariates are predicted by prior exposures given their past, the indication for g-methods, and (3) describe residual confounding after inverse probability weighting. For each diagnostic, we present time-specific metrics that encompass a wide class of joint exposures, including regimes of multivariate time-varying exposures in censored data, with multivariate point exposures as a special case. We outline how to estimate these directly or with regression and how to average them over person-time. Using a simulated example, we show how these metrics can be presented graphically. This conceptually grounded framework can potentially aid the transparent design, analysis, and reporting of studies that examine joint exposures. We provide easy-to-use tools to implement it.

TOXICS			English	Article						confounder; mediator; perfluoroalkyl substances; body mass index; Danish National Birth Cohort; National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey	THYROID-HORMONE; NUCLEAR RECEPTORS; CAUSAL DIAGRAMS; DISEASE; BIRTH; ASSOCIATION; PREGNANCY; CHEMICALS; EXPOSURE; LIFE	Confounding adjustment is important for observational studies to derive valid effect estimates for inference. Despite the theoretical advancement of confounding selection procedure, it is often challenging to distinguish between confounders and mediators due to the lack of information about the time-ordering and latency of each variable in the data. This is also the case for the studies of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a group of synthetic chemicals used in industry and consumer products that are persistent and have endocrine-disrupting properties on health outcomes. In this article, we used directed acyclic graphs to describe potential biases introduced by adjusting for or stratifying by the measure of obesity as an intermediate variable in PFAS exposure analyses. We compared results with or without adjusting for body mass index in two cross-sectional data analyses: (1) PFAS levels and maternal thyroid function during early pregnancy using the Danish National Birth Cohort and (2) PFAS levels and cardiovascular disease in adults using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. In these examples, we showed that the potential heterogeneity observed in stratified analyses by overweight or obese status needs to be interpreted cautiously considering collider stratification bias. This article highlights the complexity of seemingly simple adjustment or stratification analyses, and the need for careful consideration of the confounding and/or mediating role of obesity in PFAS studies.

In particular, we will show how to identify and infer the path-specific effect of treatment on the event time via the repeatedly measured mediator levels. The considered proposal addresses complications due to patients dying before the mediator is assessed, due to the mediator being repeatedly measured, and due to posttreatment confounding of the effect of the mediator by other mediators. We illustrate the method by an application to data from the LEADER cardiovascular outcomes trial.

J	Greenland, S				Greenland, S			The impact of prior distributions for uncontrolled confounding and response bias: A case study of the relation of wire codes and magnetic fields to childhood leukemia	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article						Bayesian statistics; confounding; epidermologic methods; leukemia; magnetic fields; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis	VOLTAGE POWER-LINES; ELECTROMAGNETIC-FIELDS; SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS; RISK; CHILDREN; CANCER; EXPOSURE; MISCLASSIFICATION; COLLAPSIBILITY; INFERENCE	This article examines the potential for misleading inferences from conventional analyses and sensitivity analyses of observational data, and describes some proposed solutions based on specifying prior distributions for uncontrolled sources of bias. The issues are illustrated in a sensitivity analysis of confounding in a study of residential wire code and childhood leukemia and in a pooled analysis of 12 studies of magnetic-field measurements and childhood leukemia. Both analyses have been interpreted as evidence in favor of a causal effect of magnetic fields on leukemia risk. This interpretation is contrasted with results from analyses based on prior distributions for the unidentified bias parameters used in the original sensitivity-analysis model. These analyses indicate that accounting for uncontrolled confounding and response bias under a reasonable prior can substantially alter inferences about the existence of a magnetic-field effect. More generally, analyses with informative priors for unidentified bias parameters can help avoid misinterpretation of conventional results and ordinary sensitivity analyses.

Chronic Periodontitis Case Definitions and Confounders in Periodontal Research: A Systematic Assessment	BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL			English	Review							POPULATION-BASED SURVEILLANCE; PERI-IMPLANT DISEASES; RISK INDICATORS; SEX-DIFFERENCES; KEY CHANGES; SMOKING; CLASSIFICATION; EPIDEMIOLOGY; DIAGNOSIS; SCHEME	Case definitions and criteria of periodontal diseases are not yet consistent worldwide. This can affect the accuracy of any comparison made between two studies. This study determines which are the most common chronic periodontitis case definitions as well as confounding variables that have been reported worldwide in periodontal literature. A systematic assessment on periodontal disease classification and confounders was conducted using all publications in MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar between 1965 and October 2017. Screening of eligible studies and data extraction were conducted in duplicate and independently by two reviewers. The search protocol produced 4,218 articles. Out of these, 492 potentially relevant articles were selected for review. Only 351 studies fulfilled the selection criteria. Combination of probing depth and clinical attachment loss was the most common chronic periodontitis case definitions used (121, studies, 34.5%). CPI/CPITNwas the most common classification used. Age was the most common confounder studied in periodontal research (303 studies, 86.3%), followed by gender (268 studies, 76.4%) and race (138 studies, 39.3%). Albumin and creatinine were the least common variables studied (1 or 2 studies each). Different case definitions affect the prevalence and treatment consequences of periodontitis. We need to standardize periodontitis case definitions worldwide to avoid difficulties in case diagnosis and prognosis. Further studies need to be done to assess the association between periodontitis and several potential confounders.

We aimed to evaluate the effect when accounting for time-dependent confounding affected by previous adherence as well as time sequence between factors. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Finnish healthcare registers. Participants Women aged 45-64years initiating statin use for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in 2001-2004 (n=42807). Outcomes Acute cardiovascular event defined as a composite of acute coronary syndrome and acute ischaemic stroke was our primary outcome. Low-energy fractures were used as a negative control outcome to evaluate the healthy-adherer effect. Results During the 3-year follow-up, 474 women experienced the primary outcome event and 557 suffered a low-energy fracture. The causal HR estimated with marginal structural model for acute cardiovascular events for all the women who remained adherent (proportion of days covered 80%) to statin therapy during the previous adherence assessment year was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.65 to 0.94) when compared with everybody remaining non-adherent (proportion of days covered <80%). The result was robust against alternative model specifications. Statin adherers had a potentially reduced risk of experiencing low-energy fractures compared with non-adherers (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.07). Conclusions Our study, which took into account the time dependence of adherence and confounders, as well as temporal order between these factors, is support for the concept that adherence to statins in women in primary prevention decreases the risk of acute cardiovascular events by about one-fifth in comparison to non-adherence. However, part of the observed effect of statin adherence on acute cardiovascular events may be due to the healthy-adherer effect.

The propensity score allows one to design and analyze an observational (nonrandomized) study so that it mimics some of the particular characteristics of a randomized controlled trial. In particular, the propensity score is a balancing score: conditional on the propensity score, the distribution of observed baseline covariates will be similar between treated and untreated subjects. I describe 4 different propensity score methods: matching on the propensity score, stratification on the propensity score, inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score, and covariate adjustment using the propensity score. I describe balance diagnostics for examining whether the propensity score model has been adequately specified. Furthermore, I discuss differences between regression-based methods and propensity score-based methods for the analysis of observational data. I describe different causal average treatment effects and their relationship with propensity score analyses.

Noncollapsibility and its role in quantifying confounding bias in logistic regression	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Logistic regression; Confounding; Noncollapsibility; Confounder-adjustment; Univariable regression analysis; Multivariable regression analysis; Inverse probability weighting; Conditional effect; Marginal effect	PROPENSITY SCORE METHODS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; COLLAPSIBILITY; LOGIT; PROBIT; MODELS	BackgroundConfounding bias is a common concern in epidemiological research. Its presence is often determined by comparing exposure effects between univariable- and multivariable regression models, using an arbitrary threshold of a 10% difference to indicate confounding bias. However, many clinical researchers are not aware that the use of this change-in-estimate criterion may lead to wrong conclusions when applied to logistic regression coefficients. This is due to a statistical phenomenon called noncollapsibility, which manifests itself in logistic regression models. This paper aims to clarify the role of noncollapsibility in logistic regression and to provide guidance in determining the presence of confounding bias.MethodsA Monte Carlo simulation study was designed to uncover patterns of confounding bias and noncollapsibility effects in logistic regression. An empirical data example was used to illustrate the inability of the change-in-estimate criterion to distinguish confounding bias from noncollapsibility effects.ResultsThe simulation study showed that, depending on the sign and magnitude of the confounding bias and the noncollapsibility effect, the difference between the effect estimates from univariable- and multivariable regression models may underestimate or overestimate the magnitude of the confounding bias. Because of the noncollapsibility effect, multivariable regression analysis and inverse probability weighting provided different but valid estimates of the confounder-adjusted exposure effect. In our data example, confounding bias was underestimated by the change in estimate due to the presence of a noncollapsibility effect.ConclusionIn logistic regression, the difference between the univariable- and multivariable effect estimate might not only reflect confounding bias but also a noncollapsibility effect. Ideally, the set of confounders is determined at the study design phase and based on subject matter knowledge. To quantify confounding bias, one could compare the unadjusted exposure effect estimate and the estimate from an inverse probability weighted model.	[Schuster, Noah A.; Twisk, Jos W.

We examined a cohort of 24,680 new users who were 4-17 years of age at the incident dispensing from the Population-Based Effectiveness in Asthma and Lung Diseases (PEAL) Network of 5 commercial health plans and TennCare, the Tennessee Medicaid program, during the period January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2010. The 3 methods yielded similar results, indicating that pediatric patients treated with leukotriene antagonists were no more likely than those treated with inhaled corticosteroids to experience adverse outcomes. Children in the TennCare population who had a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis and who then initiated the use of leukotriene antagonists were less likely to experience an asthma-related emergency department visit. A plausible explanation is that our data set is large enough that the 2 advanced propensity score-based analyses do not have advantages over the traditional covariate-adjusted regression approach. We provide important observations on how to correctly apply the methods in observational data analysis and suggest statistical research areas that need more work to guide implementation.

A sensitivity analysis using information about measured confounders yielded improved uncertainty assessments for unmeasured confounding	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						unmeasured confounding; bias; observational studies; sensitivity analysis; Bayesian statistics; pharmacoepidemiology	HEART-FAILURE; MORTALITY; BIAS; ADJUSTMENT; BLOCKERS; DATABASE	Objective: In the analysis of observational data, the argument is sometimes made that if adjustment for measured confounders induces little change in the treatment-outcome association, then there is less concern about the extent to which the association is driven by unmeasured confounding. We quantify this reasoning using Bayesian sensitivity analysis (BSA) for unmeasured confounding. Using hierarchical models, the confounding effect of a binary unmeasured variable is modeled as arising from the same distribution as that of measured confounders. Our objective is to investigate the performance of the method compared to sensitivity analysis, which assumes that there is no relationship between measured and unmeasured confounders. Study Design and Setting: We apply the method in an observational study of the effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy in heart failure patients. Results: BSA for unmeasured confounding using hierarchical prior distributions yields an odds ratio (OR) of 0.72, 95% credible interval (CrI): 0.56, 0.93 for the association between beta-blockers and mortality, whereas using independent priors yields OR = 0.72, 95% CrI: 0.45, 1.15. Conclusion: If the confounding effect of a binary unmeasured variable is similar to that of measured confounders, then conventional sensitivity analysis may give results that overstate the uncertainty about bias.

Objective: To determine the extent to which the association between SDP and offspring substance use/problems depends on confounded familial background factors by using a quasi-experimental design. Design: We used 2 separate samples from the United States and Sweden. The analyses prospectively predicted multiple indices of substance use and problems while controlling for statistical covariates and comparing differentially exposed siblings to minimize confounding. Setting: Offspring of a representative sample of women in the United States (sample 1) and the total Swedish population born during the period from January 1, 1983, to December 31, 1995 (sample 2). Patients or Other Participants: Adolescent offspring of the women in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (n=6904) and all offspring born in Sweden during the 13-year period (n=1187360). Main Outcome Measures: Self-reported adolescent alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use and early onset (before 14 years of age) of each substance (sample 1) and substance-related convictions and hospitalizations for an alcohol-or other drug-related problem (sample 2). Results: The same pattern emerged for each index of substance use/problems across the 2 samples. At the population level, maternal SDP predicted every measure of offspring substance use/problems in both samples, ranging from adolescent alcohol use (hazard ratio [HR](moderate), 1.32 [95% CI, 1.22-1.43]; HRhigh, 1.33 [1.17-1.53]) to a narcotics-related conviction (HRmoderate, 2.23 [2.14-2.31]; HRhigh, 2.97 [2.86-3.09]). When comparing differentially exposed siblings to minimize genetic and environmental confounds, however, the association between SDP and each measure of substance use/problems was minimal and not statistically significant. Conclusions: The association between maternal SDP and offspring substance use/problems is likely due to familial background factors, not a causal influence, because siblings have similar rates of substance use and problems regardless of their specific exposure to SDP.

We propose a two-stage approach for estimating the degree to which such observed associations can be explained by genetic confounding. First, we assess attenuation of exposure effects in regressions controlling for increasingly powerful polygenic scores. Second, we use structural equation models to estimate genetic confounding using heritability estimates derived from both SNP-based and twin-based studies. We examine associations between maternal education and three developmental outcomes-child educational achievement, Body Mass Index, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Polygenic scores explain between 14.3% and 23.0% of the original associations, while analyses under SNP- and twin-based heritability scenarios indicate that observed associations could be almost entirely explained by genetic confounding. Thus, caution is needed when interpreting associations from non-genetically informed epidemiology studies. Our approach, akin to a genetically informed sensitivity analysis can be applied widely. Author summary An objective shared across the life, behavioural, and social sciences is to identify factors that increase risk for a particular disease or trait. However, identifying true risk factors is challenging. Often, a risk factor is statistically associated with a disease even if it is not really relevant, meaning that even successfully improving the risk factor will not impact the disease. One reason for the existence of such misleading associations stems from genetic confounding. This is when genetic factors influence directly both the risk factor and the disease, which generates a statistical association even in the absence of a true effect of the risk factor. Here, we propose a method to estimate genetic confounding and quantify its effect on observed associations. We show that a large part of the associations between maternal education and three child outcomes-educational achievement, body mass index and Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder- is explained by genetic confounding. Our findings can be applied to better understand the role of genetics in explaining associations of key risk factors with diseases and traits.

J	Garner, C				Garner, Chad			Confounded by Sequencing Depth in Association Studies of Rare Alleles	GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						case-control study; next-generation DNA sequencing; false-positive association; genome-wide association	GENETIC-ASSOCIATION; COMMON DISEASES; GENOME; VARIANTS; REGRESSION	Next-generation DNA sequencing technologies are facilitating large-scale association studies of rare genetic variants. The depth of the sequence read coverage is an important experimental variable in the next-generation technologies and it is a major determinant of the quality of genotype calls generated from sequence data. When case and control samples are sequenced separately or in different proportions across batches, they are unlikely to be matched on sequencing read depth and a differential misclassification of genotypes can result, causing confounding and an increased false-positive rate. Data from Pilot Study 3 of the 1000 Genomes project was used to demonstrate that a difference between the mean sequencing read depth of case and control samples can result in false-positive association for rare and uncommon variants, even when the mean coverage depth exceeds 30 x in both groups. The degree of the confounding and inflation in the false-positive rate depended on the extent to which the mean depth was different in the case and control groups. A logistic regression model was used to test for association between case-control status and the cumulative number of alleles in a collapsed set of rare and uncommon variants. Including each individual's mean sequence read depth across the variant sites in the logistic regression model nearly eliminated the confounding effect and the inflated false-positive rate. Furthermore, accounting for the potential error by modeling the probability of the heterozygote genotype calls in the regression analysis had a relatively minor but beneficial effect on the statistical results.

Methods The Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases is a population-based study, where 2698 eyes (1076 Chinese, 704 Malays and 918 Indians) with high-quality SD-OCT images from individuals without eye diseases were identified. Optic disc and macular cube scans were registered to determine the distance between fovea and optic disc centres (fovea distance) and their respective angle (fovea angle). Retinal vessels were segmented in the projection images and used to calculate the circumpapillary retinal vessel density profile. Compensated RNFL thickness was generated based on optic disc (ratio, orientation and area), fovea (distance and angle), retinal vessel density, refractive error and age. Linear regression models were used to investigate the effects of clinical factors on RNFL thickness. Results Retinal vessel density reduced significantly with increasing age (1487 +/- 214 mu m in 40-49, 1458 +/- 208 mu m in 50-59, 1429 +/- 223 mu m in 60-69 and 1415 +/- 233 mu m in >= 70). Compensation reduced the variability of RNFL thickness, where the effect was greatest for Chinese (10.9%; p<0.001), followed by Malays (6.6%; p=0.075) and then Indians (4.3%; p=0.192). Compensation reduced the age-related RNFL decline by 55% in all participants (beta=-3.32 mu m vs beta=-1.50 mu m/10 years; p<0.001). Nearly 62% of the individuals who were initially classified as having abnormally thin RNFL (outside the 99% normal limits) were later reclassified as having normal RNFL. Conclusions RNFL thickness compensated for anatomical parameters reduced the variability of measurements and may improve glaucoma detection, which needs to be confirmed in future studies.

J	Strauss, D				Strauss, D			On Miettinen's multivariate confounder score	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						logistic regression; multivariate confounder score; mental retardation; tube feeding; mortality	MENTAL-RETARDATION; MORTALITY; PEOPLE	Consider a regression model for the effect of a treatment on an outcome variable in the presence of potential confounders. It is common to test for main effects and interactions of the treatment variable; if the confounding variables are discrete, one might then compare the treatment groups within strata formed by suitable covariate patterns. An alternative, due to Miettinen, is to stratify according to a "multivariate confounder score" and test for treatment effects within strata. This test has been shown to be flawed, and the method appears largely to have fallen into disuse. Here we show that such stratification nevertheless provides a sound and often useful graphical comparison of treatment and control groups. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc.

Variations in prostate biopsy recommendation and acceptance confound evaluation of risk factors for prostate cancer: Examining race and BMI	CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Risk factor; Prevention; Prostate cancer; Differential misclassification	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; VITAMIN-E; TRIAL; SELENIUM; MEN; FINASTERIDE	Background: Prostate cancer is ubiquitous in older men; differential screening patterns and variations in biopsy recommendations and acceptance will affect which man is diagnosed and, therefore, evaluation of cancer risk factors. We describe a statistical method to reduce prostate cancer detection bias among African American (n = 3398) and Non-Hispanic White men (n = 22,673) who participated in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention trial (SELECT) and revisit a previously reported association between race, obesity and prostate cancer risk. Methods: For men with screening values suggesting prostate cancer but in whom biopsy was not performed, the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator was used to estimate probability of prostate cancer. Associations of body mass index (BMI) and race with incident prostate cancer were compared for observed versus imputation-enhanced outcomes using incident density ratios. Results: Accounting for differential biopsy assessment, the previously reported positive linear trend between BMI and prostate cancer in African American men was not observed; no BMI association was found among Non-Hispanic White men. Conclusions: Differential disease classification among men who may be recommended to undergo and then consider whether to accept a prostate biopsy leads to inaccurate identification of prostate cancer risk factors. Imputing a man's prostate cancer status reduces detection bias. Covariate adjustment does not address the problem of outcome misclassification. Cohorts evaluating incident prostate cancer should collect longitudinal screening and biopsy data to adjust for this potential bias.

Since these assumptions cannot be tested using the observed data, a mediation analysis should always be accompanied by a sensitivity analysis of the resulting estimates. In this article, we propose a sensitivity analysis method for parametric estimation of direct and indirect effects when the exposure, mediator, and outcome are all binary. The sensitivity parameters consist of the correlations between the error terms of the exposure, mediator, and outcome models. These correlations are incorporated into the estimation of the model parameters and identification sets are then obtained for the direct and indirect effects for a range of plausible correlation values. We take the sampling variability into account through the construction of uncertainty intervals. The proposed method is able to assess sensitivity to both mediator-outcome confounding and confounding involving the exposure. To illustrate the method, we apply it to a mediation study based on the data from the Swedish Stroke Register (Riksstroke). An R package that implements the proposed method is available.

AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						beta carotene; lung neoplasms; measurement error; smoking	SELF-REPORTED SMOKING; BASE-LINE CHARACTERISTICS; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; ALPHA-TOCOPHEROL; CONSUMPTION; NICOTINE; COTININE; RETINOL; PLASMA; MISCLASSIFICATION	The results of three randomized trials of beta-carotene supplementation for the prevention of lung cancer among smokers are in contradiction to a large body of epidemiologic evidence for the reduction of risk of lung cancer among smokers with higher intake and/or higher serum levels of beta-carotene. Complicating this issue are widely noted negative associations between tobacco use and intake or serum levels of beta-carotene. Although observational studies attempt to control for reported smoking histories, the accuracy of self-reported smoking is uncertain; correlations as low as 0.5 between reported and true smoking exposure are not inconsistent with studies of biomarkers of cigarette exposure. The authors developed a simple statistical model for random errors in reported smoking (relative to true tobacco exposure) and assumed a modest (inverse) relation between true tobacco exposure and serum beta-carotene. Calculations from this model, combined with a model for lung cancer contemplated by Doll and Peto (J Epidemiol Community Health 1978;78:303-13), suggest that biases in assessment of smoking exposure between smokers with low versus high beta-carotene intake may plausibly explain much or all of the observed protective effect of high beta-carotene levels. Appropriate cohort studies of lung cancer in smokers, utilizing biomarkers of smoking, are needed and are presently ongoing.

J	Santacatterina, M				Santacatterina, Michele			Robust weights that optimally balance confounders for estimating marginal hazard ratios	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Survival analysis; covariate balance; Cox regression; optimization; continuous treatments; hazard ratio	OPTIMAL PROBABILITY WEIGHTS; RED MEAT CONSUMPTION; PROPENSITY SCORE; CAUSAL INFERENCE; STRUCTURAL MODELS; REGRESSION; RISK	Covariate balance is crucial in obtaining unbiased estimates of treatment effects in observational studies. Methods that target covariate balance have been successfully proposed and largely applied to estimate treatment effects on continuous outcomes. However, in many medical and epidemiological applications, the interest lies in estimating treatment effects on time-to-event outcomes. With this type of data, one of the most common estimands of interest is the marginal hazard ratio of the Cox proportional hazards model. In this article, we start by presenting robust orthogonality weights, a set of weights obtained by solving a quadratic constrained optimization problem that maximizes precision while constraining covariate balance defined as the correlation between confounders and treatment. By doing so, robust orthogonality weights optimally deal with both binary and continuous treatments. We then evaluate the performance of the proposed weights in estimating marginal hazard ratios of binary and continuous treatments with time-to-event outcomes in a simulation study. We finally apply robust orthogonality weights in the evaluation of the effect of hormone therapy on time to coronary heart disease and on the effect of red meat consumption on time to colon cancer among 24,069 postmenopausal women enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative observational study.

The effect of confounding variables in studies of lead exposure and IQ	CRITICAL REVIEWS IN TOXICOLOGY			English	Review						Blood lead; IQ; pooled-analysis; confounding variables; covariates	LEVEL; INTELLIGENCE	Methods proposed to address confounding variables frequently do not adequately distinguish confounding from covariation. A confounder is a variable that correlates both with the outcome and the major exposure variable. Accurate treatment of confounding is crucial to low dose extrapolation of the effects of chemical exposures based on epidemiology studies. This study explores the limitations of current regression models in extrapolation to the low dose region of the dose-response curve due to the existence of unrecognized and uncontrolled confounding, using epidemiological data for lead. Based on the reported data in analyses by Lanphear and colleagues and Crump and colleagues, and drawing on other studies, Wilson and Wilson considered maternal IQ, HOME score, SES, parental education, birthweight, smoking, and race as characteristic variables which may have interaction effects. This analysis identifies confounding variables based on the seven longitudinal cohorts in analyses conducted by Lanphear and colleagues and by Crump and colleagues and confirms maternal IQ, HOME score, maternal education and maternal marital status at birth are "Highly Likely" confounders, while race is a "Likely" confounder. The cohort data were reanalyzed using the methods presented by Crump and colleagues while also considering the interaction among the identified confounding variables. This analysis determined that confounders influence IQ estimates in a quantifiable way that may exceed or at least obscure previously-reported effects of blood lead on IQ with blood lead levels below 5 mu g/dL; however, limitations in the datasets make predictions of the low dose dose-response analysis questionable.

Purpose We address a bias that arises from adaptive randomization in the setting of a time trend in disease incidence. Methods We use a potential-outcome model and directed acyclic graphs to illustrate the bias that arises from a changing subject allocation ratio with a concurrent change in background risk. Results In a trial that uses adaptive randomization, time trends in risk can bias the crude effect estimate obtained by naively combining the data from the different stages of the trial. We illustrate how the bias arises from an interplay of departures from exchangeability among groups and the changing randomization proportions. Limitations We focus on risk-ratio and risk-difference analysis. Conclusions Analysis of trials using adaptive randomization should involve attention to or adjustment for possible trends in background risk. Numerous modeling strategies are available for that purpose, including stratification, trend modeling, inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting, and hierarchical regression.

Methods Using multilevel statistical models, we examined the association between state income inequality and poor self-rated health. The analysis was based on the pooled 1995 and 1997 Current Population Surveys, comprising 201 221 adults nested within 50 US states. Results Controlling for the individual effects of age, sex, race, marital status, education, income, health insurance coverage, and employment status, we found a significant effect of state income inequality on poor self-rated health. For every 0.05-increase in the Gini coefficient, the odds ratio (OR) of reporting poor health increased by 1.39 (95% CI: 1.26, 1.51). Additionally controlling for the proportion of the state population who are black did not explain away the effect of income inequality (OR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.15, 1.45). While being black at the individual level was associated with poorer self-rated health, no significant relationship was found between poor self-rated health and the proportion of black residents in a state. Conclusion Our finding demonstrates that neither race, at the individual level, nor racial composition, as measured at the state level, explain away the previously reported association between income inequality and poorer health status in the US.

Using an instrumental variable to test for unmeasured confounding	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						instrumental variables; observational study; confounding; comparative effectiveness	TO-TREAT ANALYSIS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; TREATMENT-NONCOMPLIANCE; ACCELERATION; DELIVERY; OUTCOMES; MODELS; CARE	An important concern in an observational study is whether or not there is unmeasured confounding, that is, unmeasured ways in which the treatment and control groups differ before treatment, which affect the outcome. We develop a test of whether there is unmeasured confounding when an instrumental variable (IV) is available. An IV is a variable that is independent of the unmeasured confounding and encourages a subject to take one treatment level versus another, while having no effect on the outcome beyond its encouragement of a certain treatment level. We show what types of unmeasured confounding can be tested for with an IV and develop a test for this type of unmeasured confounding that has correct type I error rate. We show that the widely used Durbin-Wu-Hausman test can have inflated type I error rates when there is treatment effect heterogeneity. Additionally, we show that our test provides more insight into the nature of the unmeasured confounding than the Durbin-Wu-Hausman test. We apply our test to an observational study of the effect of a premature infant being delivered in a high-level neonatal intensive care unit (one with mechanical assisted ventilation and high volume) versus a lower level unit, using the excess travel time a mother lives from the nearest high-level unit to the nearest lower-level unit as an IV.

Impact of parity on anthropometric measures of obesity controlling by multiple confounders: a cross-sectional study in Chilean women	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY AND COMMUNITY HEALTH			English	Article							BODY-WEIGHT CHANGES; TO-HEIGHT RATIO; WAIST CIRCUMFERENCE; RISK-FACTORS; LIFE-STYLE; MATERNAL CHARACTERISTICS; RELATIVE IMPORTANCE; METABOLIC SYNDROME; DIABETES-MELLITUS; PAROUS WOMEN	Aim: To find out whether there is an association between parity and obesity, evaluated through body mass index (BMI), waist circumference ( WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) in Chilean women after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, health risk and gynaeco-obstetric factors. Design: Cross-sectional study, using baseline data of the San Francisco Project. Setting: San Francisco de Mostazal, located in the central region of Chile, 6512 Chilean-Hispanic women ( Spanish heritage with a variable indigenous component). Methods: A weighted random sample of 508 women who had their first pregnancy inside the primary childbearing ages. Data were collected between 1997 and 1999. Statistical associations between parity and different anthropometric measurements of adiposity in multiple linear (MLnR) and logistic regression models (MLtR) were evaluated. Results: In MLnR a modest parity-related increment in BMI and practically null increment in WC, WHR and WHtR was observed. Covariates that showed a statistically significant association with anthropometric measures of adiposity were age, low education, marital status, employment, smoking, smoking cessation, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, parent's obesity, menarche and fetal macrosomia. Crude odds ratio ( OR) showed a strong association between parity and anthropometric markers of obesity. Nevertheless, after adjustments in MLtR models, the association remained only for BMI. All the measures of abdominal obesity related to parous women showed OR smaller than 1 (95% confidence intervals 0.57 to 0.96). Conclusions: Parity modestly influences BMI, but does not seem to be related to WC, WHR and WHtR after controlling by confounders. Parity can increase adiposity but not necessarily following an abdominal pattern.

Addressing unmeasured confounding in comparative observational research	PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY			English	Article						best practice recommendation; pharmacoepidemiology; sensitivity analyses; systematic review; unmeasured confounding	REGRESSION DISCONTINUITY DESIGNS; INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE METHODS; BAYESIAN SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; PROPENSITY SCORE CALIBRATION; FALSIFICATION END-POINTS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; PROGRAM-EVALUATION; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; VALIDATION DATA; FRACTURES	PurposeObservational pharmacoepidemiological studies can provide valuable information on the effectiveness or safety of interventions in the real world, but one major challenge is the existence of unmeasured confounder(s). While many analytical methods have been developed for dealing with this challenge, they appear under-utilized, perhaps due to the complexity and varied requirements for implementation. Thus, there is an unmet need to improve understanding the appropriate course of action to address unmeasured confounding under a variety of research scenarios. MethodsWe implemented a stepwise search strategy to find articles discussing the assessment of unmeasured confounding in electronic literature databases. Identified publications were reviewed and characterized by the applicable research settings and information requirements required for implementing each method. We further used this information to develop a best practice recommendation to help guide the selection of appropriate analytical methods for assessing the potential impact of unmeasured confounding. ResultsOver 100 papers were reviewed, and 15 methods were identified. We used a flowchart to illustrate the best practice recommendation which was driven by 2 critical components: (1) availability of information on the unmeasured confounders; and (2) goals of the unmeasured confounding assessment. Key factors for implementation of each method were summarized in a checklist to provide further assistance to researchers for implementing these methods. ConclusionWhen assessing comparative effectiveness or safety in observational research, the impact of unmeasured confounding should not be ignored. Instead, we suggest quantitatively evaluating the impact of unmeasured confounding and provided a best practice recommendation for selecting appropriate analytical methods.

The incorporation of external data on more detailed confounding information into the main study data may help remove confounding bias. This work was motivated by a study of the association between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and herpes zoster. Analyses were based on administrative databases in which information on important confounders-cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption-was lacking. We consider adjusting for the confounding bias arising from missing confounders by incorporating a validation sample with data on smoking and alcohol consumption obtained from a small-scale National Health Interview Survey study. We propose a 2-stage calibration (TSC) method, which summarizes the confounding information through propensity scores and combines the analysis results from the main and the validation study samples, where the propensity score adjustment from the main sample is crude and that from the validation sample is more precise. Unlike the existing methods, the validity of the TSC approach does not rely on any specific measurement error model. When applying the TSC method to the motivating study above, the odds ratio of herpes zoster associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is 1.91 (95% confidence interval: 1.62, 2.26) after adjustment for cumulative smoking and alcohol consumption.

Their joint effects are less well understood. Methods: We explored the role of air pollution in modifying the effects of heat waves on mortality, within the EuroHEAT project. Daily mortality, meteorologic, and air pollution data from nine European cities for the years 1990-2004 were assembled. We defined heat waves by taking both intensity and duration into account. The city-specific effects of heat wave episodes were estimated using generalized estimating equation models, adjusting for potential confounders with and without inclusion of air pollutants (particles, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide). To investigate effect modification, we introduced an interaction term between heat waves and each single pollutant in the models. Random effects meta-analysis was used to summarize the city-specific results. Results: The increase in the number of daily deaths during heat wave episodes was 54% higher on high ozone days compared with low, among people age 75-84 years. The heat wave effect on high PM10 days was increased by 36% and 106% in the 75-84 year and 85+ year age groups, respectively. A similar pattern was observed for effects on cardiovascular mortality. Effect modification was less evident for respiratory mortality, although the heat wave effect itself was greater for this cause of death. The heat wave effect was smaller (15-30%) after adjustment for ozone or PM10. Conclusions: The heat wave effect on mortality was larger during high ozone or high PM10 days. When assessing the effect of heat waves on mortality, lack of adjustment for ozone and especially PM10 overestimates effect parameters. This bias has implications for public health policy.

Study Design and Setting: Interrupted time series design was applied to study the prevalence of statin use in Dutch diabetes patients over the period 1998-2011. Effects of guideline changes on the outcome were estimated using a Poisson regression model with and without the birth cohort dimension modeled through random intercepts. Results: Both models estimated a stronger increase in prevalence of statin use after influential studies were published in 2003 for patients aged below 50 and above 70 years. The model that controlled for birth cohort also estimated an effect for patients aged 50-70 years from 2003 onward. The magnitude of the intervention effect for patients aged above 70 years when we controlled for birth cohort was reduced from 0.078 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.065, 0.091] to 0.027 (95% CI: 0.013, 0.041). Similarly, for patients aged below 50 years, the estimated guideline effect was reduced from 0.070 (95% CI: 0.048, 0.092) to 0.055 (95% CI: 0.035, 0.075). Conclusion: In this case study, the birth cohort dimension appeared to confound population-level effect estimates of guideline changes on prevalence of statin use in patients with diabetes.

Intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired bacteraemia and ICU mortality and discharge: addressing time-varying confounding using appropriate methodology	JOURNAL OF HOSPITAL INFECTION			English	Article						Burden; Intensive care units; Bacteraemia; Inverse probability weighting; Bias	BLOOD-STREAM INFECTIONS; MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; ATTRIBUTABLE MORTALITY; NOSOCOMIAL INFECTIONS; MULTISTATE MODELS; RISK-FACTORS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; POPULATION	Background: Studies often ignore time-varying confounding or may use inappropriate methodology to adjust for time-varying confounding. Aim: To estimate the effect of intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired bacteraemia on ICU mortality and discharge using appropriate methodology. Methods: Marginal structural models with inverse probability weighting were used to estimate the ICU mortality and discharge associated with ICU-acquired bacteraemia among patients who stayed more than two days at the general ICU of a London teaching hospital and remained bacteraemia-free during those first two days. For comparison, the same associations were evaluated with (i) a conventional Cox model, adjusting only for baseline confounders and (ii) a Cox model adjusting for baseline and time-varying confounders. Findings: Using the marginal structural model with inverse probability weighting, bacteraemia was associated with an increase in ICU mortality (cause-specific hazard ratio (CSHR): 1.29; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02-1.63)and a decrease in discharge (CSHR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.45-0.60). By 60 days, among patients still in the ICU after two days and without prior bacteraemia, 8.0% of ICU deaths could be prevented by preventing all ICU-acquired bacteraemia cases. The conventional Cox model adjusting for time-varying confounders gave substantially different results [for ICU mortality, CSHR: 1.08 (95% CI: 0.88-1.32); for discharge, CSHR: 0.68 (95% CI: 0.60-0.77)].

We used daily measurements for particulate matter less than 10 mum in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) and/or black smoke from 29 European cities. We considered confounding from other pollutants as well as meteorologic and chronologic variables. We investigated several variables describing the cities' pollution, climate, population, and geography as potential effect modifiers. For the individual city analysis, generalized additive models extending Poisson regression, using a smoother to control for seasonal patterns, were applied. To provide quantitative summaries of the results and explain remaining heterogeneity, we applied second-stage regression models. The estimated increase in the daily number of deaths for all ages for a 10 mug/m(3) increase in daily PM10 or black smoke concentrations was 0.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.4-0.8%], whereas for the elderly it was slightly higher. We found important effect modification for several of the variables studied. Thus, in a city with low average NO2, the estimated increase in daily mortality for an increase of 10 mug/m(3) in PM10 was 0.19 (95% CI = 0.00-0.41), whereas in a city with high average NO2 it was 0.80% (95% CI = 0.67-0.93%); in a relatively cold climate the corresponding effect was 0.29% (95% CI = 0.16-0.42), whereas in a warm climate it was 0.82% (95% CI = 0.69-0.96); in a city with low standardized mortality rate it was 0.80% (95% CI = 0.65-0.95%), and in one with a high rate it was 0.43% (95% CI = 0.24-0.62). Our results confirm those previously reported on the effects of ambient particles on mortality. Furthermore, they show that the heterogeneity found in the effect parameters among cities reflects real effect modification, which is explained by specific city characteristics.

Possible confounders are typically not measured in such databases. We show how to assess the impact of confounders in a study aimed at comparing cardiovascular (CV) risk according to drug regimen prescribed at starting antihypertensive therapy, nominally one agent (monotherapy) or a combination of agents in a unique tablet (fixed-dose combination) or in at least two distinct tablets (extemporaneous combination). Study Design and Settings: A nested case-control study was carried out by including the 209,650 patients from Lombardy (Italy) newly treated between 2000 and 2001. Cases were the 10,688 patients who were hospitalized for CV disease until 2007. Three controls were selected for each case. Logistic regression was used to model the CV risk associated with initial therapeutic regimen. A Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis was performed for accounting unmeasured confounders (hypertension severity and chronic disease score) by means of external adjustment with medical record (MR) data. Results: Compared with patients on fixed-dose combination, those on extemporaneous combination or monotherapy, respectively, had CV risk increased to 15% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3%, 29%) or 17% (95% CI: 8%, 26%). External adjustment did not modify the risk associated with monotherapy. In contrast, the excess of risk associated with extemporaneous combination was annulled when external adjustment was applied. Conclusion: MR data can be used to assess confounding bias unmeasured from HCU database. Starting antihypertensive therapy with a combination of agents probably reduces the CV risk with respect to monotherapy, even in the setting of primary prevention. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Addressing geographic confounding through spatial propensity scores: a study of racial disparities in diabetes	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Diabetes control; doubly robust estimator; geographic confounding; health disparities; propensity scores; spatial data analysis	US POPULATION; CAUSAL INFERENCE; STROKE MORTALITY; NATIONAL-HEALTH; UNITED-STATES; REGRESSION; ADULTS; AMERICANS; TUTORIAL; MODELS	Motivated by a study exploring differences in glycemic control between non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white veterans with type 2 diabetes, we aim to address a type of confounding that arises in spatially referenced observational studies. Specifically, we develop a spatial doubly robust propensity score estimator to reduce bias associated with geographic confounding, which occurs when measured or unmeasured confounding factors vary by geographic location, leading to imbalanced group comparisons. We augment the doubly robust estimator with spatial random effects, which are assigned conditionally autoregressive priors to improve inferences by borrowing information across neighboring geographic regions. Through a series of simulations, we show that ignoring spatial variation results in increased absolute bias and mean squared error, while the spatial doubly robust estimator performs well under various levels of spatial heterogeneity and moderate sample sizes. In the motivating application, we construct three global estimates of the risk difference between race groups: an unadjusted estimate, a doubly robust estimate that adjusts only for patient-level information, and a hierarchical spatial doubly robust estimate. Results indicate a gradual reduction in the risk difference at each stage, with the inclusion of spatial random effects providing a 20% reduction compared to an estimate that ignores spatial heterogeneity. Smoothed maps indicate poor glycemic control across Alabama and southern Georgia, areas comprising the so-called "stroke belt." These results suggest the need for community-specific interventions to target diabetes in geographic areas of greatest need.

Matching Methods for Confounder Adjustment: An Addition to the Epidemiologist's Toolbox	EPIDEMIOLOGIC REVIEWS			English	Review						epidemiologic methods; propensity score	PROPENSITY-SCORE; CAUSAL INFERENCE; MODEL MISSPECIFICATION; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; REMOVE BIAS; BALANCE; STRATIFICATION; ROBUSTNESS; ESTIMATORS; SELECTION	Propensity score weighting and outcome regression are popular ways to adjust for observed confounders in epidemiologic research. Here, we provide an introduction to matching methods, which serve the same purpose but can offer advantages in robustness and performance. A key difference between matching and weighting methods is that matching methods do not directly rely on the propensity score and so are less sensitive to its misspecification or to the presence of extreme values. Matching methods offer many options for customization, which allow a researcher to incorporate substantive knowledge and carefully manage bias/variance trade-offs in estimating the effects of nonrandomized exposures. We review these options and their implications, provide guidance for their use, and compare matching methods with weighting methods. Because of their potential advantages over other methods, matching methods should have their place in an epidemiologist's methodological toolbox.

Adjusting for confounding by indication in observational studies: a case study in traumatic brain injury	CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						confounding; observational studies; traumatic brain injury; instrumental variable analysis; comparative effectiveness research	ACUTE SUBDURAL-HEMATOMA; PROPENSITY SCORE; HEAD-INJURY; MORTALITY; MANAGEMENT; CARE; BIAS; CLASSIFICATION; HEMORRHAGE; GUIDELINES	Introduction: Observational studies of interventions are at risk for confounding by indication. The objective of the current study was to define the circumstances for the validity of methods to adjust for confounding by indication in observational studies. Patients and methods: We performed post hoc analyses of data prospectively collected from three European and North American traumatic brain injury studies including 1,725 patients. The effects of three interventions (intracranial pressure [ICP] monitoring, intracranial operation and primary referral) were estimated in a proportional odds regression model with the Glasgow Outcome Scale as ordinal outcome variable. Three analytical methods were compared: classical covariate adjustment, propensity score matching and instrumental variable (IV) analysis in which the percentage exposed to an intervention in each hospital was added as an independent variable, together with a random intercept for each hospital. In addition, a simulation study was performed in which the effect of a hypothetical beneficial intervention (OR 1.65) was simulated for scenarios with and without unmeasured confounders. Results: For all three interventions, covariate adjustment and propensity score matching resulted in negative estimates of the treatment effect (OR ranging from 0.80 to 0.92), whereas the IV approach indicated that both ICP monitoring and intracranial operation might be beneficial (OR per 10% change 1.17, 95% CI 1.01-1.42 and 1.42, 95% CI 0.95-1.97). In our simulation study, we found that covariate adjustment and propensity score matching resulted in an invalid estimate of the treatment effect in case of unmeasured confounders (OR ranging from 0.90 to 1.03). The IV approach provided an estimate in the similar direction as the simulated effect (OR per 10% change 1.04-1.05) but was statistically inefficient. Conclusion: The effect estimation of interventions in observational studies strongly depends on the analytical method used. When unobserved confounding and practice variation are expected in observational multicenter studies, IV analysis should be considered.

Method - Standardised morbidity ratios were calculated for cancers in Great Britain for 1981 and standardised mortality ratios for all cause mortality in Great Britain between 1982 and 1985. Deprivation indices were calculated for enumeration districts and wards from 1981 small area census statistics. Cancers and deaths were allocated to enumeration districts via their postcode. Standardised morbidity and mortality ratios were calculated by quintile of enumeration district according to the deprivation index. Standardised mortality ratios were further analysed by deprivation of ward, region, and urban/rural status. Results - Strong relationships were found between all cause mortality and the incidence of selected cancers and deprivation quintile - there was up to a twofold difference in lung cancer incidence between the highest and lowest quintile. The deprivation index can be used to measure gradients of deprivation according to the distance from industrial sites. The deprivation index for enumeration districts showed similar discrimination of mortality as the index for wards. There is some interaction between deprivation and region in their effect on the standardised mortality ratios, leading to a small bias in the estimation of expected numbers if this is not taken into account. The relationship between deprivation, urban/rural status, and mortality is complex and confounded by region, but mortality tends to be higher in urban than in rural areas within quintiles of deprivation. Discussion - Whether calculated for enumeration districts or wards, the main problems in the interpretation of the deprivation index may be its limited correlation with the risk factors of interest and its concentration on present rather than past socioeconomic status. Indirect standardisation based on stratification for deprivation and other variables involves a trade off between bias and precision in determining the fineness and the number of axes of stratification. Some bias may occur due to interaction between region and deprivation and the effects of urban/rural status. Complementary approaches including modelling and proportional mortality or morbidity analyses may be needed and the possibility of residual socioeconomic confounding must always be considered. Conclusion - There is potential for important socioeconomic confounding in small area studies of environmental pollution and health where the health outcome under examination has a strong relationship to socioeconomic status and where the putative excess risk due to pollution may be small. One method of controlling for confounding is to use an ecological measurement of deprivation in small areas, and to adjust for deprivation by indirect standardisation. However, residual socioeconomic confounding can be expected, which may seriously complicate the interpretation of small area studies.

Birthweight, gestational age and familial confounding in sex differences in infant mortality: a matched co-twin control study of Brazilian male-female twin pairs identified by population data linkage	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Twins; infant; neonatal; mortality; sex differences; birthweight; familial confounding; gestational age; data linkage; administrative data	NEONATAL-MORTALITY; MODELS; LENGTH	Background In infancy, males are at higher risk of dying than females. Birthweight and gestational age are potential confounders or mediators but are also familial and correlated, posing epidemiological challenges that can be addressed by studying male-female twin pairs. Methods We studied 28 558 male-female twin pairs born in Brazil between 2012 and 2016, by linking their birth and death records. Using a co-twin control study matched for gestational age and familial factors, we applied logistic regression with random effects (to account for paired data) to study the association between male sex and infant death, adjusting for: birthweight, within- and between-pair effects of birthweight, birth order and gestational age, including interactions. The main outcome was infant mortality (0-365 days) stratified by neonatal (early and late) and postneonatal deaths. Results Males were 100 g heavier and more at risk of infant death than their female co-twins before [odds ratio (OR) = 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11-1.49, P = 0.001] and after (OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.39-1.83, P <0.001) adjusting for birthweight and birth order. When adjusting for birthweight within-pair difference and mean separately, the OR attenuated to 1.40 (95% CI: 1.21-1.61, P <0.001), with evidence of familial confounding (likelihood ratio test, P <0.001). We found evidence of interaction (P = 0.001) between male sex and gestational age for early neonatal death. Conclusions After matching for gestational age and familial factors by design and controlling for birthweight and birth order, males remain at greater risk of infant death than their female co-twins. Birthweight's role as a confounder can be partially explained by familial factors.
