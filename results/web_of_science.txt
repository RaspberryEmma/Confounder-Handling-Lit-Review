Variable Selection for Confounding Adjustment in High-dimensional Covariate Spaces When Analyzing Healthcare Databases	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							PROPENSITY-SCORE; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; SIMULATION; SHRINKAGE; EVENTS; NUMBER; SAFETY; BIAS	Background: Data-adaptive approaches to confounding adjustment may improve performance beyond expert knowledge when analyzing electronic healthcare databases and have additional practical advantages for analyzing multiple databases in rapid cycles. Improvements seemed possible if outcome predictors were reliably identified empirically and adjusted. Methods: In five cohort studies from diverse healthcare databases, we implemented a base-case high-dimensional propensity score algorithm with propensity score decile-adjusted outcome models to estimate treatment effects among prescription drug initiators. The original variable selection procedure based on the estimated bias of each variable using unadjusted associations between confounders and exposure (RRCE) and disease outcome (RRCD) was augmented by alternative strategies. These included using increasingly adjusted RRCD estimates, including models considering > 1,500 variables jointly (Lasso, Bayesian logistic regression); using prediction statistics or likelihood-ratio statistics for covariate prioritization; directly estimating the propensity score with > 1,500 variables (Lasso, Bayesian regression); or directly fitting an outcome model using all covariates jointly (Lasso, Ridge). Results: In five example studies, most tested augmentations of the base-case hdPS did not meaningfully change estimates in light of wide confidence intervals except for Bayesian regression and Lasso to estimate RRCD, which moved estimates minimally closer to the expectation in three of five examples. The direct outcome estimation with Lasso performed worst. Conclusion: Overall, the basic heuristic of variable reduction in highdimensional propensity score adjustment performed, as well as alternative approaches in diverse settings. Minor improvements in variable selection may be possible using Bayesian outcome regression to prioritize variables for propensity score estimation when outcomes are rare.

This has led to an interest in developing microbial interventions for treatment of disease and optimization of crop yields which requires identification of microbiome features that impact the outcome in the population of interest. That task is challenging because of the high dimensionality of microbiome data and the confounding that results from the complex and dynamic interactions among host, environment, and microbiome. In the presence of such confounding, variable selection and estimation procedures may have unsatisfactory performance in identifying microbial features with an effect on the outcome. Results In this manuscript, we aim to estimate population-level effects of individual microbiome features while controlling for confounding by a categorical variable. Due to the high dimensionality and confounding-induced correlation between features, we propose feature screening, selection, and estimation conditional on each stratum of the confounder followed by a standardization approach to estimation of population-level effects of individual features. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate the advantages of our approach in recovering relevant features. Utilizing a potential-outcomes framework, we outline assumptions required to ascribe causal, rather than associational, interpretations to the identified microbiome effects. We conducted an agricultural study of the rhizosphere microbiome of sorghum in which nitrogen fertilizer application is a confounding variable. In this study, the proposed approach identified microbial taxa that are consistent with biological understanding of potential plant-microbe interactions. Conclusions Standardization enables more accurate identification of individual microbiome features with an effect on the outcome of interest compared to other variable selection and estimation procedures when there is confounding by a categorical variable.

J	DeMaris, A				DeMaris, Alfred			Combating Unmeasured Confounding in Cross-Sectional Studies: Evaluating Instrumental-Variable and Heckman Selection Models	PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS			English	Article						instrumental-variables regression; Heckman selection model; Monte Carlo study; causal inference; nonexperimental design	MARITAL-STATUS; MENTAL-HEALTH; COHABITATION; DEPRESSION; MARRIAGE; GENDER; BIAS; BENEFITS; PROBIT	Unmeasured confounding is the principal threat to unbiased estimation of treatment "effects" (i.e., regression parameters for binary regressors) in nonexperimental research. It refers to unmeasured characteristics of individuals that lead them both to be in a particular "treatment" category and to register higher or lower values than others on a response variable. In this article, I introduce readers to 2 econometric techniques designed to control the problem, with a particular emphasis on the Heckman selection model (HSM). Both techniques can be used with only cross-sectional data. Using a Monte Carlo experiment, I compare the performance of instrumental-variable regression (IVR) and HSM to that of ordinary least squares (OLS) under conditions with treatment and unmeasured confounding both present and absent. I find HSM generally to outperform IVR with respect to mean-square-error of treatment estimates, as well as power for detecting either a treatment effect or unobserved confounding. However, both HSM and IVR require a large sample to be fully effective. The use of HSM and IVR in tandem with OLS to untangle unobserved confounding bias in cross-sectional data is further demonstrated with an empirical application. Using data from the 2006 - 2010 General Social Survey (National Opinion Research Center, 2014), I examine the association between being married and subjective well-being.

These phenomena are particularly dangerous in internet-based public health surveillance, where traditional mitigation and adjustment methods are inapplicable, unavailable, or out of date. Recent theoretical advances in causal modeling can mitigate these threats, but these innovations have not been widely deployed in the epidemiological community.Objective: The purpose of our paper is to demonstrate the practical utility of causal modeling to both detect unmeasured confounding and selection bias and guide model selection to minimize bias. We implemented this approach in an applied epidemiological study of the COVID-19 cumulative infection rate in the New York City (NYC) spring 2020 epidemic.Methods: We collected primary data from Qualtrics surveys of Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) crowd workers residing in New Jersey and New York State across 2 sampling periods: April 11-14 and May 8-11, 2020. The surveys queried the subjects on household health status and demographic characteristics. We constructed a set of possible causal models of household infection and survey selection mechanisms and ranked them by compatibility with the collected survey data. The most compatible causal model was then used to estimate the cumulative infection rate in each survey period.Results: There were 527 and 513 responses collected for the 2 periods, respectively. Response demographics were highly skewed toward a younger age in both survey periods. Despite the extremely strong relationship between age and COVID-19 symptoms, we recovered minimally biased estimates of the cumulative infection rate using only primary data and the most compatible causal model, with a relative bias of +3.8% and -1.9% from the reported cumulative infection rate for the first andConclusions: We successfully recovered accurate estimates of the cumulative infection rate from an internet-based crowdsourced sample despite considerable selection bias and unmeasured confounding in the primary data. This implementation demonstrates how simple applications of structural causal modeling can be effectively used to determine falsifiable model conditions, detect selection bias and confounding factors, and minimize estimate bias through model selection in a novel epidemiological context. As the disease and social dynamics of COVID-19 continue to evolve, public health surveillance protocols must continue to adapt; the emergence of Omicron variants and shift to at-home testing as recent challenges. Rigorous and transparent methods to develop, deploy, and diagnosis adapted surveillance protocols will be critical to their success.

We illustrate these limitations in the case of random confounding and designs that prevent such confounding. In many experimental designs individual treatment allocations are dependent, and explicit population models are needed to show this dependency. In particular, certain designs impose unfaithful covariate-treatment distributions to prevent random confounding, yet ordinary causal graphs cannot discriminate between these unconfounded designs and confounded studies. Causal models for populations are better suited for displaying these phenomena than are individual-level models, because they allow representation of allocation dependencies as well as outcome dependencies across individuals. Nonetheless, even with this extension, ordinary graphical models still fail to capture distinctions between hypothetical superpopulations (sampling distributions) and observed populations (actual distributions), although potential-outcome models can be adapted to show these distinctions and their consequences.

More recently it has been shown that stratifying on a variable that precedes exposure and disease can induce confounding, even if there is no confounding in the unstratified (crude) estimate. This paper examines the relative magnitudes of these biases under some simple causal models in which the stratification variable is graphically depicted as a collider (a variable directly affected by two or more other variables in the graph). The results suggest that bias from stratifying on variables affected by exposure and disease may often be comparable in size with bias from classical confounding (bias from failing to stratify on a common cause of exposure and disease), whereas other biases from collider stratification may tend to be much smaller.

Selection of confounding variables should not be based on observed associations with exposure	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Bias; Confounder selection; Confounding; Pharmacoepidemiology	CLINICAL-TRIALS; MODELS; BIAS	In observational studies, selection of confounding variables for adjustment is often based on observed baseline incomparability. The aim of this study was to evaluate this selection strategy. We used clinical data on the effects of inhaled long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) use on the risk of mortality among patients with obstructive pulmonary disease to illustrate the impact of selection of confounding variables for adjustment based on baseline comparisons. Among 2,394 asthma and COPD patients included in the analyses, the LABA ever-users were considerably older than never-users, but cardiovascular co-morbidity was equally prevalent (19.9% vs. 19.9%). Adjustment for cardiovascular co-morbidity status did not affect the crude risk ratio (RR) for mortality: crude RR 1.19 (95% CI 0.93-1.51) versus RR 1.19 (95% CI 0.94-1.50) after adjustment for cardiovascular co-morbidity. However, after adjustment for age (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.76-1.19), additional adjustment for cardiovascular co-morbidity status did affect the association between LABA use and mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.80-1.26). Confounding variables should not be discarded based on balanced distributions among exposure groups, because residual confounding due to the omission of confounding variables from the adjustment model can be relevant.

The modelling approach typically involves selecting both a lag at which the effect of particulates should be evaluated and a level of filtering to remove long-term associations confounded with seasonal variations and secular trend. In this paper we investigate the bias introduced by model selection and residual confounding using simulations based on a previous analysis of data from King County, Washington. In comparison with the original analyses we find that the bias is small in absolute terms but of the same order as the estimated health impacts. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Papadogeorgou, G; Dominici, F				Papadogeorgou, Georgia; Dominici, Francesca			A CAUSAL EXPOSURE RESPONSE FUNCTION WITH LOCAL ADJUSTMENT FOR CONFOUNDING: ESTIMATING HEALTH EFFECTS OF EXPOSURE TO LOW LEVELS OF AMBIENT FINE PARTICULATE MATTER	ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Air pollution; cardiovascular hospitalizations; causal inference; exposure response function; local confounding; low-exposure levels; particulate matter	AIR-POLLUTION EXPOSURE; CANADIAN CENSUS HEALTH; TERM PM2.5 EXPOSURE; MORTALITY; ASSOCIATION; SELECTION; CURVE; RISK; POPULATION; COHORT	In the last two decades ambient levels of air pollution have declined substantially. At the same time the Clean Air Act mandates that the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) must be routinely assessed to protect populations based on the latest science. Therefore, researchers should continue to address the following question: is exposure to levels of air pollution below the NAAQS harmful to human health? Furthermore, the contentious nature surrounding environmental regulations urges us to cast this question within a causal inference framework. Several parametric and semiparametric regression approaches have been used to estimate the exposure-response (ER) curve between long-term exposure to ambient air pollution concentrations and health outcomes. However, most of the existing approaches are not formulated within a formal framework for causal inference, adjust for the same set of potential confounders across all levels of exposure and do not account for model uncertainty regarding covariate selection and the shape of the ER. In this paper we introduce a Bayesian framework for the estimation of a causal ER curve called LERCA (Local Exposure Response Confounding Adjustment), which: (a) allows for different confounders and different strength of confounding at the different exposure levels, and (b) propagates model uncertainty regarding confounders' selection and the shape of the ER. Importantly, LERCA provides a principled way of assessing the observed covariates' confounding importance at different exposure levels, providing researchers with important information regarding the set of variables to measure and adjust for in regression models. Using simulation studies, we show that state-of-the-art approaches perform poorly in estimating the ER curve in the presence of local confounding. LERCA is used to evaluate the relationship between long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5, a key regulated pollutant, and cardiovascular hospitalizations for 5,362 zip codes in the continental U.S. and located near a pollution monitoring site, while adjusting for a potentially varying set of confounders across the exposure range. Our data set includes rich health, weather, demographic and pollution information for the years of 2011-2013. The estimated exposure-response curve is increasingly indicating that higher ambient concentrations lead to higher cardiovascular hospitalization rates, and ambient PM2.5 was estimated to lead to an increase in cardiovascular hospitalization rates when focusing at the low-exposure range. Our results indicate that there is no threshold for the effect of PM2.5 on cardiovascular hospitalizations.

The authors present findings from the Slone Epidemiology Unit Birth Defects Study, 1992-1997, a case-control study on folic acid supplementation and risk of neural tube defects. When statistical strategies for confounding evaluation are used, the adjusted odds ratio is 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.62, 1.21). However, the consideration of a priori causal knowledge suggests that the crude odds ratio of 0.65 (95% confidence interval: 0.46, 0.94) should be used because the adjusted odds ratio is invalid. Causal diagrams are used to encode qualitative a priori subject matter knowledge.

One possible reason is that many research programs involve themes in which there is a certain degree of uncertainty as to mechanisms in the processes that generate the data. In this study, the relationship between occupational stress and obesity is used as an example of the application of causal diagrams to questions related to confounding. The article presents the selection stages for variables in statistical adjustment and the derivation of a causal diagram's statistical implications. The main advantage of causal diagrams is that they explicitly reveal the respective model's underlying hypotheses, allowing critical analysis of the implications and thereby facilitating identification of sources of bias and uncertainty in the epidemiological study's results.

Time-Dependent Confounding in the Estimation of Treatment Effects in Randomised Trials with Multimodal Therapies - An Illustration of the Problem of Time-Dependent Confounding by Causal Graphs	GESUNDHEITSWESEN			German	Article						time-dependent confounding; selection bias; randomised trials; causal inference; directed acyclic graphs	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; INTENT-TO-TREAT	Biased effect estimates induced by unconsidered confounding variables are a known problem in observational studies. Selection bias, resulting from non-random sampling of study participants, is widely recognised as a problem in case-control and cross-sectional studies. In contrast, possible bias in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is mostly ignored. This paper illustrates, by applying directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), possible bias in the effect estimates of first-line therapy, caused by subsequent changes in therapy (time-dependent confounding). Possible selection bias, induced by not only random loss to follow-up, will be explained as well using DAGs. Underlying assumptions of standard methods usually used to analyse RCTs (like intention-to-treat, per-protocol) are shown and it is explained why effect estimates may be biased in RCTs, if only these conventional methods are used. Adequate statistical methods (causal inference models as marginal structural models and structural nested models) exist. Higher documentary efforts, however, are necessary, because any changes in medication, loss to follow-up as well as reasons for such changes need to be documented in detail as required by these advanced statistical methods. Nevertheless, causal inference models should become standard along side the currently applied standard methods, especially in studies with high non-compliance due to changes in therapy and substantial loss to follow-up. Possible bias cannot be excluded if similar results are obtained from both methods. However, study results should be interpreted with caution if they differ between both approaches.	[Zietemann, V.

We propose a Bayesian nonparametric approach that simultaneously (1) prioritizes inclusion of adjustment variables in accordance with existing principles of confounder selection; (2) estimates causal effects in a manner that permits complex relationships among confounders, exposures, and outcomes; and (3) provides causal estimates that account for uncertainty in the nature of confounding. The proposal relies on specification of multiple Bayesian additive regression trees models, linked together with a common prior distribution that accrues posterior selection probability to covariates on the basis of association with both the exposure and the outcome of interest. A set of extensive simulation studies demonstrates that the proposed method performs well relative to similarly-motivated methodologies in a variety of scenarios. We deploy the method to investigate the causal effect of emissions from coal-fired power plants on ambient air pollution concentrations, where the prospect of confounding due to local and regional meteorological factors introduces uncertainty around the confounding role of a high-dimensional set of measured variables. Ultimately, we show that the proposed method produces more efficient and more consistent results across adjacent years than alternative methods, lending strength to the evidence of the causal relationship between SO2 emissions and ambient particulate pollution.

If the number of the potential confounders (p) is larger than the number of observations (n), then direct control for all potential confounders is infeasible. Existing approaches for dimension reduction and penalization are generally aimed at predicting the outcome, and are less suited for estimation of causal effects. Under standard penalization approaches (e.g. Lasso), if a variable X-j is strongly associated with the treatment T but weakly with the outcome Y, the coefficient beta(j) will be shrunk towards zero thus leading to confounding bias. Under the assumption of a linear model for the outcome and sparsity, we propose continuous spike and slab priors on the regression coefficients beta(j) corresponding to the potential confounders X-j. Specifically, we introduce a prior distribution that does not heavily shrink to zero the coefficients (beta(j)s) of the X(j)s that are strongly associated with T but weakly associated with Y. We compare our proposed approach to several state of the art methods proposed in the literature. Our proposed approach has the following features: 1) it reduces confounding bias in high dimensional settings; 2) it shrinks towards zero coefficients of instrumental variables; and 3) it achieves good coverages even in small sample sizes. We apply our approach to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data to estimate the causal effects of persistent pesticide exposure on triglyceride levels.

Patients' characteristics can affect the exposure (confounding) as well as the timing of routine visits (measurement process), and those characteristics may be altered following a visit which can create dependencies between the monitoring and body mass index when viewed as a stochastic or random processes in time. This may result in a form of selection bias that distorts the estimation of the marginal effect of the antidepressant. Inverse intensity of visit weights have been proposed to adjust for these imbalances, however no approaches have addressed complex settings where the covariate and the monitoring processes affect each other in time so as to induce endogeneity, a situation likely to occur in electronic health records. We review how selection bias due to outcome-dependent follow-up times may arise and propose a new cumulated weight that models a complete monitoring path so as to address the above-mentioned challenges and produce a reliable estimate of the impact of antide-pressants on body mass index. More specifically, we do so using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink in the United Kingdom, comparing the marginal effect of two commonly used antidepressants, citalopram and fluoxetine, on body mass index. The results are compared to those obtained with simpler methods that do not account for the extent of the dependence due to an endogenous covariate process.	[Coulombe, Janie; Moodie, Erica E.

Confounding, causality, and confusion: the role of intermediate variables in interpreting observational studies in obstetrics	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY			English	Article						causal pathway; collider stratification bias; confounder; descending proxy; inappropriate adjustment; intermediate variable; overadjustment; perinatal paradox; selection bias; unmeasured confounding	BIRTH-WEIGHT; PERINATAL-MORTALITY; GESTATIONAL-AGE; CEREBRAL-PALSY; PRETERM BIRTH; BIAS; PREECLAMPSIA; DIAGRAMS; RISK; FETAL	Prospective and retrospective cohorts and case-control studies are some of the most important study designs in epidemiology because, under certain assumptions, they can mimic a randomized trial when done well. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, properly accounting for 2 important sources of bias: confounding and selection bias. While not adjusting the causal association for an intermediate variable will yield an unbiased estimate of the exposure-outcome's total causal effect, it is often that obstetricians will want to adjust for an intermediate variable to assess if the intermediate is the underlying driver of the association. Such a practice must be weighed in light of the underlying research question and whether such an adjustment is necessary should be carefully considered. Gestational age is, by far, the most commonly encountered variable in obstetrics that is often mislabeled as a confounder when, in fact, it may be an intermediate. If, indeed, gestational age is an intermediate but if mistakenly labeled as a confounding variable and consequently adjusted in an analysis, the conclusions can be unexpected. The implications of this overadjustment of an intermediate as though it were a confounder can render an otherwise persuasive study downright meaningless. This commentary provides an exposition of confounding bias, collider stratification, and selection biases, with applications in obstetrics and perinatal epidemiology.

We present a two-step approach for exposure selection with subsequent confounder adjustment for statistical inference. Methods: We measured cognitive ability in 338 children using the Woodcock-Mun similar to oz General Intellectual Ability (GIA) score, and potential associated features across several environmental domains. Initially, 111 variables theoretically associated with GIA score were introduced into a Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) in a 50% feature selection subsample. Effect estimates for selected features were subsequently modeled in linear regressions in a 50% inference (hold out) subsample, first adjusting for sex and age and later for covariates selected via directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). All models were adjusted for clustering by school. Results: Of the 15 LASSO selected variables, eleven were not associated with GIA score following our inference modeling approach. Four variables were associated with GIA scores, including: serum ferritin adjusted for inflammation (inversely), mother's IQ (positively), father's education (positively), and hours per day the child works on homework (positively). Serum ferritin was not in the expected direction. Conclusions: Our two-step approach moves high-dimensional feature selection a step further by incorporating DAG-based confounder adjustment for statistical inference.

Ignoring selection bias can result in unreliable or misleading estimates of the causal effect. Generalized boosted models were used to estimate propensity scores from 42 confounding variables for a sample of 361 neonates. Using emergent neonatal attention and orientation skills as an example developmental outcome, we examined the impact of tobacco exposure with and without accounting for selection bias. Weight at birth, an outcome related to tobacco exposure, also was used to examine the functionality of the propensity score approach. Without inclusion of propensity scores, tobacco-exposed neonates did not differ from their nonexposed peers in attention skills over the first month or in weight at birth. When the propensity score was included as a covariate, exposed infants had marginally lower attention and a slower linear change rate at 4 weeks, with greater quadratic deceleration over the first month. Similarly, exposure-related differences in birth weight emerged when propensity scores were included as a covariate. The propensity score method captured the selection bias intrinsic to this observational study of prenatal tobacco exposure. Selection bias obscured the deleterious impact of tobacco exposure on the development of neonatal attention. The illustrated analytic strategy offers an example to better characterize the impact of prenatal tobacco exposure on important developmental outcomes by directly modeling and statistically accounting for the selection bias from the sampling process.

J	Wilson, IH; Wilson, SB				Wilson, Ian Harold; Wilson, Simon Barton			Confounding and causation in the epidemiology of lead	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH RESEARCH			English	Article						Lead epidemiology; confounding; statistical analysis; bias; threshold	BLOOD LEAD; ENVIRONMENTAL LEAD; CHILDRENS INTELLIGENCE; INTELLECTUAL-DEVELOPMENT; EXPOSURE; LEVEL; IQ; CONSEQUENCES; AGE	The National Health and Medical Research Council recently reported that there were not enough high-quality studies to conclude that associations between health effects and blood lead levels<10g/dL were caused by lead. It identified uncontrolled confounding, measurement error and other potential causal factors as common weaknesses. This paper supports those findings with evidence of uncontrolled confounding by parental education, intelligence or household management from several papers. It suggests that inappropriate statistical tests and aggregation of data representing different exposure routes partly explain why confounding has been overlooked. Inadequate correction of confounding has contributed to incorrect conclusions regarding causality at low levels of lead. Linear or log-linear regression models have tended to mask any threshold. While the effects of higher levels of lead exposure are not disputed, overestimation of health effects at low lead exposures has significant implications for policy-makers endeavouring to protect public health through cost-effective regulations.

Although the principles behind confounder selection are now well established, variable selection for confounder adjustment remains a difficult problem in practice, particularly in secondary analyses of databases. We present a simulation study that compares the high-dimensional propensity score algorithm for variable selection with approaches that utilize direct adjustment for all potential confounders via regularized regression, including ridge regression and lasso regression. Simulations were based on 2 previously published pharmacoepidemiologic cohorts and used the plasmode simulation framework to create realistic simulated data sets with thousands of potential confounders. Performance of methods was evaluated with respect to bias and mean squared error of the estimated effects of a binary treatment. Simulation scenarios varied the true underlying outcome model, treatment effect, prevalence of exposure and outcome, and presence of unmeasured confounding. Across scenarios, high-dimensional propensity score approaches generally performed better than regularized regression approaches. However, including the variables selected by lasso regression in a regular propensity score model also performed well and may provide a promising alternative variable selection method.

J	Yuan, YB; Qu, AN				Yuan, Yubai; Qu, Annie			De-confounding Causal Inference Using Latent Multiple-Mediator Pathways	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION			English	Article; Early Access						Causal identification; Generalized additive model; Latent factor modeling; Mediation analysis; Sequential ignorability	DNA METHYLATION; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; NONLINEAR ICA; DEATH; VARIABLES; HEALTH; CANCER; RISK; BIAS	Causal effect estimation from observational data is one of the essential problems in causal inference. However, most estimation methods rely on the strong assumption that all confounders are observed, which is impractical and untestable in the real world. We develop a mediation analysis framework inferring the latent confounder for debiasing both direct and indirect causal effects. Specifically, we introduce generalized structural equation modeling that incorporates structured latent factors to improve the goodness-of-fit of the model to observed data, and deconfound the mediators and outcome simultaneously. One major advantage of the proposed framework is that it uses the causal pathway structure from cause to outcome via multiple mediators to debias the causal effect without requiring external information on latent confounders. In addition, the proposed framework is flexible in terms of integrating powerful nonparametric prediction algorithms while retaining interpretable mediation effects. In theory, we establish the identification of both causal and mediation effects based on the proposed deconfounding method. Numerical experiments on both simulation settings and a normative aging study indicate that the proposed approach reduces the estimation bias of both causal and mediation effects.

Simultaneous adjustment of uncontrolled confounding, selection bias and misclassification in multiple-bias modelling	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Multi-bias modelling; confounding; information bias; selection bias; parameters; imputed; regression weight; mis-specification; simulation	REAL-WORLD EVIDENCE; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; CAUSAL DIAGRAMS; FORMULAS	Background Adjusting for multiple biases usually involves adjusting for one bias at a time, with careful attention to the order in which these biases are adjusted. A novel, alternative approach to multiple-bias adjustment involves the simultaneous adjustment of all biases via imputation and/or regression weighting. The imputed value or weight corresponds to the probability of the missing data and serves to 'reconstruct' the unbiased data that would be observed based on the provided assumptions of the degree of bias. Methods We motivate and describe the steps necessary to implement this method. We also demonstrate the validity of this method through a simulation study with an exposure-outcome relationship that is biased by uncontrolled confounding, exposure misclassification, and selection bias. Results The study revealed that a non-biased effect estimate can be obtained when correct bias parameters are applied. It also found that incorrect specification of every bias parameter by +/-25% still produced an effect estimate with less bias than the observed, biased effect. Conclusions Simultaneous multi-bias analysis is a useful way of investigating and understanding how multiple sources of bias may affect naive effect estimates. This new method can be used to enhance the validity and transparency of real-world evidence obtained from observational, longitudinal studies.

We develop a loss minimization approach for estimating bounds on the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) when unobserved confounders have a bounded effect on the odds ratio of treatment selection. Our approach is scalable and allows flexible use of model classes in estimation, including nonparametric and black-box machine learning methods. Based on these bounds for the CATE, we propose a sensitivity analysis for the average treatment effect (ATE). Our semiparametric estimator extends/bounds the augmented inverse propensity weighted (AIPW) estimator for the ATE under bounded unobserved confounding. By constructing a Neyman orthogonal score, our estimator of the bound for the ATE is a regular root-n estimator so long as the nuisance parameters are estimated at the op(n(-1/4)) rate. We complement our methodology with optimality results showing that our proposed bounds are tight in certain cases. We demonstrate our method on simulated and real data examples, and show accurate coverage of our confidence intervals in practical finite sample regimes with rich covariate information.

Confounding in Statistical Mediation Analysis: What It Is and How to Address It	JOURNAL OF COUNSELING PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						mediation; causal inference; confounder adjustment	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; PREVENTION PROGRAM; CAUSAL INFERENCE; BIAS FORMULAS; SELF-EFFICACY; IDENTIFICATION; INTERVENTION; CHILDREN; DESIGN	Psychology researchers are often interested in mechanisms underlying how randomized interventions affect outcomes such as substance use and mental health. Mediation analysis is a common statistical method for investigating psychological mechanisms that has benefited from exciting new methodological improvements over the last 2 decades. One of the most important new developments is methodology for estimating causal mediated effects using the potential outcomes framework for causal inference. Potential outcomes-based methods developed in epidemiology and statistics have important implications for understanding psychological mechanisms. We aim to provide a concise introduction to and illustration of these new methods and emphasize the importance of confounder adjustment. First, we review the traditional regression approach for estimating mediated effects. Second, we describe the potential outcomes framework. Third, we define what a confounder is and how the presence of a confounder can provide misleading evidence regarding mechanisms of interventions. Fourth, we describe experimental designs that can help rule out confounder bias. Fifth, we describe new statistical approaches to adjust for measured confounders of the mediator-outcome relation and sensitivity analyses to probe effects of unmeasured confounders on the mediated effect. All approaches are illustrated with application to a real counseling intervention dataset. Counseling psychologists interested in understanding the causal mechanisms of their interventions can benefit from incorporating the most up-to-date techniques into their mediation analyses.

Often this data does not measure all the necessary confounders. In many occasions, an extensive set of additional covariates is measured for a smaller and non-representative population (the validation study). In this setting, standard approaches for missing data imputation might not be adequate due to the large number of missing covariates in the main data relative to the smaller sample size of the validation data. We propose a Bayesian approach to estimate the average causal effect in the main study that borrows information from the validation study to improve confounding adjustment. Our approach combines ideas of Bayesian model averaging, confounder selection, and missing data imputation into a single framework. It allows for different treatment effects in the main study and in the validation study, and propagates the uncertainty due to the missing data imputation and confounder selection when estimating the average causal effect (ACE) in the main study. We compare our method to several existing approaches via simulation. We apply our method to a study examining the effect of surgical resection on survival among 10 396 Medicare beneficiaries with a brain tumor when additional covariate information is available on 2220 patients in SEER-Medicare. We find that the estimated ACE decreases by 30% when incorporating additional information from SEER-Medicare.

J	Norström, F; Hammarström, A				Norstrom, Fredrik; Hammarstrom, Anne			Methodological perspectives on the study of the health effects of unemployment - reviewing the mode of unemployment, the statistical analysis method and the role of confounding factors	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Unemployment; Labour market; Propensity score weighting; G-computation; Biased estimates	PROPENSITY SCORE METHODS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; REGRESSION; QUALITY	Introduction Studying the relationship between unemployment and health raises many methodological challenges. In the current study, the aim was to evaluate the sensitivity of estimates based on different ways of measuring unemployment and the choice of statistical model. Methods The Northern Swedish cohort was used, and two follow-up surveys thereof from 1995 and 2007, as well as register data about unemployment. Self-reported current unemployment, self-reported accumulated unemployment and register-based accumulated unemployment were used to measure unemployment and its effect on self-reported health was evaluated. Analyses were conducted with G-computation, logistic regression and three estimators for the inverse probability weighting propensity scores, and 11 potentially confounding variables were part of the analyses. Results were presented with absolute differences in the proportion with poor self-reported health between unemployed and employed individuals, except when logistic regression was used alone. Results Of the initial 1083 pupils in the cohort, our analyses vary between 488-693 individuals defined as employed and 61-214 individuals defined as unemployed. In the analyses, the deviation was large between the unemployment measures, with a difference of at least 2.5% in effect size when unemployed was compared with employed for the self-reported and register-based unemployment modes. The choice of statistical method only had a small influence on effect estimates and the deviation was in most cases lower than 1%. When models were compared based on the choice of potential confounders in the analytical model, the deviations were rarely above 0.6% when comparing models with 4 and 11 potential confounders. Our variable for health selection was the only one that strongly affected estimates when it was not part of the statistical model. Conclusions How unemployment is measured is highly important when the relationship between unemployment and health is estimated. However, misspecifications of the statistical model or choice of analytical method might not matter much for estimates except for the inclusion of a variable measuring health status before becoming unemployed. Our results can guide researchers when analysing similar research questions. Model diagnostics is commonly lacking in publications, but they remain very important for validation of analyses.

J	Genbäck, M; de Luna, X				Genback, Minna; de Luna, Xavier			Causal inference accounting for unobserved confounding after outcome regression and doubly robust estimation	BIOMETRICS			English	Article						average causal effects; double robust; ignorability assumption; regular food intake; sensitivity analysis; uncertainty intervals	SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; SAMPLE SELECTION; GRIP STRENGTH; UNCERTAINTY; MODELS; HEALTH; BIAS	Causal inference with observational data can be performed under an assumption of no unobserved confounders (unconfoundedness assumption). There is, however, seldom clear subject-matter or empirical evidence for such an assumption. We therefore develop uncertainty intervals for average causal effects based on outcome regression estimators and doubly robust estimators, which provide inference taking into account both sampling variability and uncertainty due to unobserved confounders. In contrast with sampling variation, uncertainty due to unobserved confounding does not decrease with increasing sample size. The intervals introduced are obtained by modeling the treatment assignment mechanism and its correlation with the outcome given the observed confounders, allowing us to derive the bias of the estimators due to unobserved confounders. We are thus also able to contrast the size of the bias due to violation of the unconfoundedness assumption, with bias due to misspecification of the models used to explain potential outcomes. This is illustrated through numerical experiments where bias due to moderate unobserved confounding dominates misspecification bias for typical situations in terms of sample size and modeling assumptions. We also study the empirical coverage of the uncertainty intervals introduced and apply the results to a study of the effect of regular food intake on health. An R-package implementing the inference proposed is available.

If the number of covariates is large relative to the number of observations, then controlling for all available covariates is infeasible. In cases where a sparsity condition holds, variable selection or penalization can reduce the dimension of the covariate space in a manner that allows for valid estimation of treatment effects. In this article, we propose matching on both the estimated propensity score and the estimated prognostic scores when the number of covariates is large relative to the number of observations. We derive asymptotic results for the matching estimator and show that it is doubly robust in the sense that only one of the two score models need be correct to obtain a consistent estimator. We show via simulation its effectiveness in controlling for confounding and highlight its potential to address nonlinear confounding. Finally, we apply the proposed procedure to analyze the effect of gender on prescription opioid use using insurance claims data.

This study aimed to explain (dis)advantages of these techniques in estimating the effect of breast-conserving therapy (BCT) and mastectomy on 10-year distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS).MethodsAll women diagnosed in 2005 with primary T1-2N0-1 breast cancer treated with BCT or mastectomy were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. We used multivariable Cox regression to correct for confounding. Propensity trimming was used to create a more homogeneous population for which the treatment choice was not self-evident. Hospital of surgery was used as hierarchical level to handle hospital-related variation, and as IV to deal with unmeasured confounding.ResultsMultivariable Cox regression showed higher 10-year DMFS for BCT than mastectomy [HR 0.70 (95% CI 0.60-82)]. Propensity trimming on the 10-90th and the 20-80th percentile of the propensity score distribution and hierarchical modelling showed similar HRs. IV analysis showed no significant difference between BCT and mastectomy.ConclusionUnmeasured confounding is very difficult to eliminate in observational research. We cannot conclude that BCT or mastectomy has a causal relationship with 10-year DMFS. It is crucial to critically evaluate all model's assumptions, and to be careful in drawing firm conclusions.

In this article, we develop theory for causal effects defined with respect to a different type of intervention, one which alters the information propagated through the edges of the graph. These information transfer interventions may be more useful than node interventions in settings in which causes are non-manipulable, for example when considering race or genetics as a causes. Furthermore, information transfer interventions allow us to define path-specific decompositions which are identified in the presence of treatment-induced mediator-outcome confounding, a practical problem whose general solution remains elusive. We prove that the proposed effects provide valid statistical tests of mechanisms, unlike popular methods based on randomised interventions on the mediator. We propose efficient non-parametric estimators for a covariance version of the proposed effects, using data-adaptive regression coupled with semi-parametric efficiency theory to address model misspecification bias while retaining n-consistency and asymptotic normality. We illustrate the use of our methods in two examples using publicly available data.

Appropriate adjustment for confounding in such studies is challenging because exposure is determined by a complex interaction of patient, physician, and healthcare system factors. The challenges of confounding control are particularly acute in studies using healthcare utilization databases where information on many potential confounding factors is lacking and the meaning of variables is often unclear. We discuss advantages and disadvantages of different approaches to confounder control in healthcare databases. In settings where considerable uncertainty surrounds the data or the causal mechanisms underlying the treatment assignment and outcome process, we suggest that researchers report a panel of results under various specifications of statistical models. Such reporting allows the reader to assess the sensitivity of the results to model assumptions that are often not supported by strong subject-matter knowledge.	[Brookhart, M.

In the presence of structural confounding, certain covariate strata will contain only subjects who could never be exposed, a violation of the positivity or experimental treatment effect assumption. Thus, structural confounding can prohibit the exchangeability necessary for meaningful causal contrasts across levels of exposure. The authors explored the presence and magnitude of structural confounding by estimating the independent effects of neighborhood deprivation and neighborhood racial composition (segregation) on rates of preterm birth in Wake and Durham counties, North Carolina (1999-2001). Tabular analyses and random-intercept fixed-slope multilevel logistic models portrayed different structural realities in these counties. The multilevel modeling results suggested some nonsignificant effect of residence in tracts with high levels of socioeconomic deprivation or racial residential segregation on adjusted odds of preterm birth for white and black women living in these counties, and the confidence limit ratios indicated fairly consistent levels of precision around the estimates. The results of the tabular analysis, however, suggested that many of these regression modeling findings were off-support and based on no actual data. The implications for statistical and public health inference, in the presence of no data, are considered.

However, with few exposed outcomes to inform covariate selection and many candidate confounders, optimal approaches to construct and implement propensity-score-based confounding adjustment remain unclear. Methods: In a cohort study on the effect of anticonvulsant drugs on cardiovascular risk among adult patients from the HealthCore Integrated Research Database, we compared the performance for confounding control of various covariate-selection strategies for propensity-score estimation (expert knowledge only, expert knowledge informed by empirical covariate selection via high-dimensional propensity-score, and high-dimensional propensity-score empirical specification only) and propensity-score-based adjustment methods (propensity-score-matching and propensity-score-decile stratification). This article focuses on the first 90 days of follow-up because any treatment effect identified in this temporal window almost certainty originates from residual confounding rather than pharmacologic action. Results: We identified 166,031 new users and 564 ischemic cardiovascular events. Among those, 12,580 patients initiated anticonvulsants that strongly induce cytochrome P450 enzymes and experienced 68 events. The unadjusted hazard ratio was 1.72 (95% confidence interval = 1.34-2.22). Adjustment for investigator-identified covariates led to 41% to 59% reductions in the hazard ratio; adjustment for both investigator-identified and high-dimensional propensity-score empirically identified covariates led to larger reductions (54% to 72%). A selection strategy based on high-dimensional propensity-score empirical specification alone produced less-attenuated and more-volatile hazard ratio estimates. This volatility seemed to be slightly attenuated in a trimmed propensity-score-stratified analysis. Conclusions: The high-dimensional propensity-score algorithm complements expert knowledge for confounding adjustment, but in settings with few exposed outcomes, its performance without investigator-specified covariates is less clear and may be associated with an increased likelihood of bias. In our example, investigator specification of variables combined with high-dimensional propensity-score empirical selection and the use of trimmed propensity-score-stratified analysis seem to improve effect estimation. Plotting the relation of effect estimates to the increasing number of empirical covariates is a useful diagnostic.

The first school is linked to path analysis and structural equation models (SEMs), while the second is related mostly to methods developed within the potential outcomes approach to causal inference. By giving model-free definitions of direct and indirect effects and clear assumptions for their identification, the latter school has formalized notions intuitively developed in the former and has greatly increased the flexibility of the models involved. However, through its predominant focus on nonparametric identification, the causal inference approach to effect decomposition via natural effects is limited to settings that exclude intermediate confounders. Such confounders are naturally dealt with (albeit with the caveats of informality and modeling inflexibility) in the SEM framework. Therefore, it seems pertinent to revisit SEMs with intermediate confounders, armed with the formal definitions and (parametric) identification assumptions from causal inference. Here we investigate: 1) how identification assumptions affect the specification of SEMs, 2) whether the more restrictive SEM assumptions can be relaxed, and 3) whether existing sensitivity analyses can be extended to this setting. Data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (1990-2005) are used for illustration.

We demonstrate the use of multiple PS estimation methods to optimize covariate balance. Methods: We used secondary data from 1292 adults with nonpsychotic major depressive disorder in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression trial (2001-2004). After initial citalopram treatment failed, patient preference influenced assignment to medication augmentation (n = 565) or switch (n = 727). To reduce selection bias, we used boosted classification and regression trees (BCART) and logistic regression iteratively to identify two potentially optimal PSs. We assessed and compared covariate balance. Results: After iterative selection of interaction terms to minimize imbalance, logistic regression yielded better balance than BCART (average standardized absolute mean difference across 47 covariates: 0.03 vs. 0.08, matching; 0.02 vs. 0.05, weighting). Conclusions: Comparing multiple PS estimates is a pragmatic way to optimize balance. Logistic regression remains valuable for this purpose. Simulation studies are needed to compare PS models under varying conditions. Such studies should consider more flexible estimation methods, such as logistic models with automated selection of interactions or hybrid models using main effects logistic regression instead of a constant log-odds as the initial model for BCART.

Multiply robust causal inference with double-negative control adjustment for categorical unmeasured confounding	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES B-STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Causal inference; Negative control; Semiparametric inference; Unmeasured confounding	CONTROL EXPOSURES; TIME-SERIES; BIAS	Unmeasured confounding is a threat to causal inference in observational studies. In recent years, the use of negative controls to mitigate unmeasured confounding has gained increasing recognition and popularity. Negative controls have a long-standing tradition in laboratory sciences and epidemiology to rule out non-causal explanations, although they have been used primarily for bias detection. Recently, Miao and colleagues have described sufficient conditions under which a pair of negative control exposure and outcome variables can be used to identify non-parametrically the average treatment effect (ATE) from observational data subject to uncontrolled confounding. We establish non-parametric identification of the ATE under weaker conditions in the case of categorical unmeasured confounding and negative control variables. We also provide a general semiparametric framework for obtaining inferences about the ATE while leveraging information about a possibly large number of measured covariates. In particular, we derive the semiparametric efficiency bound in the non-parametric model, and we propose multiply robust and locally efficient estimators when non-parametric estimation may not be feasible. We assess the finite sample performance of our methods in extensive simulation studies. Finally, we illustrate our methods with an application to the post-licensure surveillance of vaccine safety among children.

A Proxy Variable View of Shared Confounding	INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MACHINE LEARNING, VOL 139	Proceedings of Machine Learning Research		English	Proceedings Paper	International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)	JUL 18-24, 2021	ELECTR NETWORK				BLESSINGS; IDENTIFICATION	Causal inference from observational data can be biased by unobserved confounders. Confounders-the variables that affect both the treatments and the outcome-induce spurious non-causal correlations between the two. Without additional conditions, unobserved confounders generally make causal quantities hard to identify. In this paper, we focus on the setting where there are many treatments with shared confounding, and we study under what conditions is causal identification possible. The key observation is that we can view subsets of treatments as proxies of the unobserved confounder and identify the intervention distributions of the rest. Moreover, while existing identification formulas for proxy variables involve solving integral equations, we show that one can circumvent the need for such solutions by directly modeling the data. Finally, we extend these results to an expanded class of causal graphs, those with other confounders and selection variables.

These range from ultrasensitive molecular switches in signaling pathways, to assembly and activation of inflammasomes, to rupture of lysosomes and pyroptosis of cells. Realistic dose-response modeling and risk analysis must confront the reality of nonlinear C-R functions. This paper reviews several challenges for traditional statistical regression modeling of C-R functions with thresholds and nonlinearities, together with methods for overcoming them. Statistically significantly positive exposure-response regression coefficients can arise from many non-causal sources such as model specification errors, incompletely controlled confounding, exposure estimation errors, attribution of interactions to factors, associations among explanatory variables, or coincident historical trends. If so, the unadjusted regression coefficients do not necessarily predict how or whether reducing exposure would reduce risk. We discuss statistical options for controlling for such threats, and advocate causal Bayesian networks and dynamic simulation models as potentially valuable complements to nonparametric regression modeling for assessing causally interpretable nonlinear C-R functions and understanding how time patterns of exposures affect risk. We conclude that these approaches are promising for extending the great advances made in statistical C-R modeling methods in recent decades to clarify how to design regulations that are more causally effective in protecting human health.

Double Bias: Estimation of Causal Effects from Length-Biased Samples in the Presence of Confounding	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOSTATISTICS			English	Article						Causal Inference; Length-biased Sampling; Propensity Score; Cox Proportional Hazard model; Accelerated Failure Time model	PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS REGRESSION; NONPARAMETRIC-ESTIMATION; PREVALENT COHORT; PROPENSITY SCORE; SURVIVAL CURVES; LIKELIHOOD; MODELS; STATIONARITY; STATISTICS	Length bias in survival data occurs in observational studies when, for example, subjects with shorter lifetimes are less likely to be present in the recorded data. In this paper, we consider estimating the causal exposure (treatment) effect on survival time from observational data when, in addition to the lack of randomization and consequent potential for confounding, the data constitute a length-biased sample; we hence term this a double-bias problem. We develop estimating equations that can be used to estimate the causal effect indexing the structural Cox proportional hazard and accelerated failure time models for point exposures in double-bias settings. The approaches rely on propensity score-based adjustments, and we demonstrate that estimation of the propensity score must be adjusted to acknowledge the length-biased sampling. Large sample properties of the estimators are established and their small sample behavior is studied using simulations. We apply the proposed methods to a set of, partly synthesized, length-biased survival data collected as part of the Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA) to compare survival of subjects with dementia among institutionalized patients versus those recruited from the community and depict their adjusted survival curves.

Unifying instrumental variable and inverse probability weighting approaches for inference of causal treatment effect and unmeasured confounding in observational studies	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Causal treatment effect; identification bounds; instrumental variable; inverse probability weighting; unmeasured confounding	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; PRINCIPAL STRATIFICATION; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; PROPENSITY SCORE; BOUNDS; IDENTIFICATION; REGRESSION; DESIGN; TRIALS; COHORT	Confounding is a major concern when using data from observational studies to infer the causal effect of a treatment. Instrumental variables, when available, have been used to construct bound estimates on population average treatment effects when outcomes are binary and unmeasured confounding exists. With continuous outcomes, meaningful bounds are more challenging to obtain because the domain of the outcome is unrestricted. In this paper, we propose to unify the instrumental variable and inverse probability weighting methods, together with suitable assumptions in the context of an observational study, to construct meaningful bounds on causal treatment effects. The contextual assumptions are imposed in terms of the potential outcomes that are partially identified by data. The inverse probability weighting component incorporates a sensitivity parameter to encode the effect of unmeasured confounding. The instrumental variable and inverse probability weighting methods are unified using the principal stratification. By solving the resulting system of estimating equations, we are able to quantify both the causal treatment effect and the sensitivity parameter (i.e. the degree of the unmeasured confounding). We demonstrate our method by analyzing data from the HIV Epidemiology Research Study.

For a time-to-event response, marginal structural Cox models are frequently used to deal with such confounding. To avoid some of the problems of fitting marginal structural Cox model, the sequential Cox approach has been suggested as an alternative. Although the estimation mechanisms are different, both approaches claim to estimate the causal effect of treatment by appropriately adjusting for time-dependent confounding. We carry out simulation studies to assess the suitability of the sequential Cox approach for analyzing time-to-event data in the presence of a time-dependent covariate that may or may not be a time-dependent confounder. Results from these simulations revealed that the sequential Cox approach is not as effective as marginal structural Cox model in addressing the time-dependent confounding. The sequential Cox approach was also found to be inadequate in the presence of a time-dependent covariate. We propose a modified version of the sequential Cox approach that correctly estimates the treatment effect in both of the above scenarios. All approaches are applied to investigate the impact of beta-interferon treatment in delaying disability progression in the British Columbia Multiple Sclerosis cohort (1995-2008).

Controlling for time-dependent confounding using marginal structural models	STATA JOURNAL			English	Article						st0075; marginal structural models; causal models; weighted regression; survival analysis; logistic regression; confounding		Longitudinal studies in which exposures, confounders, and outcomes are measured repeatedly over time have the potential to allow causal inferences about the effects of exposure on outcome. There is particular interest in estimating the causal effects of medical treatments (or other interventions) in circumstances in which a randomized controlled trial is difficult or impossible. However, standard methods for estimating exposure effects in longitudinal studies are biased in the presence of time-dependent confounders affected by prior treatment. This article describes the use of marginal structural models (described by Robins, Hern'an, and Brumback [2000]) to estimate exposure or treatment effects in the presence of time-dependent confounders affected by prior treatment. The method is based on deriving inverse-probability-of-treatment weights, which are then used in a pooled logistic regression model to estimate the causal effect of treatment on outcome. We demonstrate the use of marginal structural models to estimate the effect of methotrexate on mortality in persons suffering from rheumatoid arthritis.

Time-modified Confounding	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						bias (epidemiology); confounding factors (epidemiology); structural model	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL; CAUSAL INFERENCE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; DEFINITION; MORTALITY; KNOWLEDGE; RATIO; BIAS	According to the authors, time-modified confounding occurs when the causal relation between a time-fixed or time-varying confounder and the treatment or outcome changes over time. A key difference between previously described time-varying confounding and the proposed time-modified confounding is that, in the former, the values of the confounding variable change over time while, in the latter, the effects of the confounder change over time. Using marginal structural models, the authors propose an approach to account for time-modified confounding when the relation between the confounder and treatment is modified over time. An illustrative example and simulation show that, when time-modified confounding is present, a marginal structural model with inverse probability-of-treatment weights specified to account for time-modified confounding remains approximately unbiased with appropriate confidence limit coverage, while models that do not account for time-modified confounding are biased. Correct specification of the treatment model, including accounting for potential variation over time in confounding, is an important assumption of marginal structural models. When the effect of confounders on either the treatment or outcome changes over time, time-modified confounding should be considered.

J	Lindmark, A				Lindmark, Anita			Sensitivity analysis for unobserved confounding in causal mediation analysis allowing for effect modification, censoring and truncation	STATISTICAL METHODS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Causal inference; Indirect effect; Direct effect; Parametric estimation; Sequential ignorability; Uncertainty interval	BIAS FORMULAS; INFERENCE	Causal mediation analysis is used to decompose the total effect of an exposure on an outcome into an indirect effect, taking the path through an intermediate variable, and a direct effect. To estimate these effects, strong assumptions are made about unconfoundedness of the relationships between the exposure, mediator and outcome. These assumptions are difficult to verify in a given situation and therefore a mediation analysis should be complemented with a sensitivity analysis to assess the possible impact of violations. In this paper we present a method for sensitivity analysis to not only unobserved mediator-outcome confounding, which has largely been the focus of previous literature, but also unobserved confounding involving the exposure. The setting is estimation of natural direct and indirect effects based on parametric regression models. We present results for combinations of binary and continuous mediators and outcomes and extend the sensitivity analysis for mediator-outcome confounding to cases where the continuous outcome variable is censored or truncated. The proposed methods perform well also in the presence of interactions between the exposure, mediator and observed confounders, allowing for modeling flexibility as well as exploration of effect modification. The performance of the method is illustrated through simulations and an empirical example.

Although this approach controls for time-invariant confounders by design, it may allow for selection bias and confounding by time-varying factors. We conducted a simulation study of the sensitivity of the symmetric bidirectional case-crossover design to time-varying patterns in exposure and outcome. We identified the effects of selection bias and confounding on symmetric bidirectional case-cross, over results and offer strategies to eliminate or reduce these biases. Selection bias results when exposure in the reference periods is not identically representative of exposure in the hazard periods, even when the distribution of exposure is stationary. This bias can be estimated and removed. Selection bias also occurs when the distribution of exposure is nonstationary, but the adjusted symmetric bidirectional case-crossover methodology substantially controls for this. Confounding results from a common temporal pattern in the exposure and the outcome time series, but can also be the result of patterns in exposure and outcome that, although asymptotically uncorrelated, are correlated at finite series lengths. All three biases are reduced by choosing shorter referent-spacing lengths. This effect is illustrated using data on air pollution and daily deaths in Chicago.

We propose a semiparametric identification of natural direct and indirect effects in the presence of unmeasured mediatoroutcome confounding by leveraging heteroskedasticity restrictions on the observed data law. For inference, we develop semiparametric estimators that remain consistent under partial misspecifications of the observed data model. We illustrate the proposed estimators using simulations and an application that evaluates the effect of self-efficacy on fatigue among health care workers during the COVID-19 outbreak.

J	Schnell, PM; Papadogeorgou, G				Schnell, Patrick M.; Papadogeorgou, Georgia			MITIGATING UNOBSERVED SPATIAL CONFOUNDING WHEN ESTIMATING THE EFFECT OF SUPERMARKET ACCESS ON CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE DEATHS	ANNALS OF APPLIED STATISTICS			English	Article						Causal inference; cardiovascular disease; food access; Markov random field spatial confounding; unmeasured confounding	PROPENSITY SCORE; FOOD STORES; REGRESSION; SELECTION; MODELS; SENSITIVITY; INFERENCE; DESIGN	Confounding by unmeasured spatial variables has received some attention in the spatial statistics and causal inference literatures, but concepts and approaches have remained largely separated. In this paper we aim to bridge these distinct strands of statistics by considering unmeasured spatial confounding within a causal inference framework and estimating effects using outcome regression tools popular within the spatial literature. First, we show how using spatially correlated random effects in the outcome model, an approach common among spatial statisticians, does not necessarily mitigate bias due to spatial confounding, a previously published but not universally known result. Motivated by the bias term of commonly-used estimators, we propose an affine estimator which addresses this deficiency. We discuss how unbiased estimation of causal parameters in the presence of unmeasured spatial confounding can only be achieved under an untestable set of assumptions which will often be application specific. We provide a set of assumptions which describe how the exposure and outcome of interest relate to the unmeasured variables, and we show that this set of assumptions is sufficient for identification of the causal effect based on the observed data when spatial dependencies can be represented by a ring graph. We implement our method using a fully Bayesian approach applicable to any type of outcome variable. This work is motivated by and used to estimate the effect of county-level limited access to supermarkets on the rate of cardiovascular disease deaths in the elderly across the whole continental United States. Even though standard approaches return null or protective effects, our approach uncovers evidence of unobserved spatial confounding and indicates that limited supermarket access has a harmful effect on cardiovascular mortality.

Comparative Effectiveness of Prostate Cancer Treatments: Evaluating Statistical Adjustments for Confounding in Observational Data	JNCI-JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE			English	Article							ANDROGEN DEPRIVATION THERAPY; INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE METHODS; HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY; PROPENSITY SCORE; RADICAL PROSTATECTOMY; BREAST-CANCER; MEDICARE CLAIMS; SELF-SELECTION; LUNG-CANCER; MEN	Background Using observational data to assess the relative effectiveness of alternative cancer treatments is limited by patient selection into treatment, which often biases interpretation of outcomes. We evaluated methods for addressing confounding in treatment and survival of patients with early-stage prostate cancer in observational data and compared findings with those from a benchmark randomized clinical trial. Methods We selected 14 302 early-stage prostate cancer patients who were aged 66-74 years and had been treated with radical prostatectomy or conservative management from linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare data from January 1, 1995, through December 31, 2003. Eligibility criteria were similar to those from a clinical trial used to benchmark our analyses. Survival was measured through December 31, 2007, by use of Cox proportional hazards models. We compared results from the benchmark trial with results from models with observational data by use of traditional multivariable survival analysis, propensity score adjustment, and instrumental variable analysis. Results Prostate cancer patients receiving conservative management were more likely to be older, nonwhite, and single and to have more advanced disease than patients receiving radical prostatectomy. In a multivariable survival analysis, conservative management was associated with greater risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality ( hazard ratio [HR] = 1.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.27 to 2.00) and all-cause mortality ( HR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.35 to 1.59) than radical prostatectomy. Propensity score adjustments resulted in similar patient characteristics across treatment groups, although survival results were similar to traditional multivariable survival analyses. Results for the same comparison from the instrumental variable approach, which theoretically equalizes both observed and unobserved patient characteristics across treatment groups, differed from the traditional multivariable and propensity score results but were consistent with findings from the subset of elderly patient with early-stage disease in the trial (ie, conservative management vs radical prostatectomy: for prostate cancer-specific mortality, HR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.08 to 6.73; for all-cause mortality, HR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.46 to 2.59). Conclusion Instrumental variable analysis may be a useful technique in comparative effectiveness studies of cancer treatments if an acceptable instrument can be identified.

However, in the literature, the term confounding by indication is not always used consistently. The authors found three different situations in which the term has been applied or might have been used but was not: confounding by indication as protopathic bias, as confounding by severity, or as a form of selection bias. It might be helpful to limit use of the term confounding by indication to the situation in which the disease that forms the indication acts as a confounder irrespective of its severity and to apply the term confounding by severity ii the severity of this disease acts as a confounder. Protopathic bias and selection bias should not be confused with these terms. The use of appropriate terms ultimately will improve communication among researchers and contribute to the clarity of their papers.

To study the potential for ecological Variables to reduce confounding by indication, we used a large database of admissions for ruptured cerebral aneurysms to evaluate the association of in-hospital death with treatment type-surgery or endovascular therapy. We compared results of three multivariable models: individual-level, ecological, and a two-level model with an ecological treatment variable and individual-level covariates and outcome. Trends in the individual-level and ecological models were in opposite directions. suggesting confounding by indication in the individual-level analysis. The two-level analysis revealed a strong association between institutional utilization of endovascular therapy and reduced individual risk of in-hospital death. Using an ecological treatment variable in an individual analysis may combine reduced confounding by indication in ecological analyses with increased power and more precise specification of outcomes and covariates in individual-level analyses.

Treatment Effects in the Presence of Unmeasured Confounding: Dealing With Observations in the Tails of the Propensity Score Distribution-A Simulation Study	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						bias (epidemiology); causal inference; cohort studies; confounding factors (epidemiology); epidemiologic methods; models, statistical; propensity score; research design	ADJUSTMENT; MORTALITY	Frailty, a poorly measured confounder in older patients, can promote treatment in some situations and discourage it in others. This can create unmeasured confounding and lead to nonuniform treatment effects over the propensity score (PS). The authors compared bias and mean squared error for various PS implementations under PS trimming, thereby excluding persons treated contrary to prediction. Cohort studies were simulated with a binary treatment T as a function of 8 covariates X. Two of the covariates were assumed to be unmeasured strong risk factors for the outcome and present in persons treated contrary to prediction. The outcome Y was simulated as a Poisson function of T and all X's. In analyses based on measured covariates only, the range of PS's was trimmed asymmetrically according to the percentile of PS in treated patients at the lower end and in untreated patients at the upper end. PS trimming reduced bias due to unmeasured confounders and mean squared error in most scenarios assessed. Treatment effect estimates based on PS range restrictions do not correspond to a causal parameter but may be less biased by such unmeasured confounding. Increasing validity based on PS trimming may be a unique advantage of PS's over conventional outcome models.

Although studies using more robust methodologies provided some clarity, sources of bias persist and it remains critical to quickly address this question. In this review, we discuss pernicious sources of bias using a causal model framework, including time-varying confounder, collider, information, and time-dependent bias, in the context of recently published studies. We discuss causal inference methodologies that can address these issues, including causal diagrams, time-to-event analyses, sensitivity analyses, and marginal structural modeling. We discuss effect modification and we propose a role for causal mediation analysis to estimate indirect effects via mediating factors, especially components of the renin--angiotensin system. Thorough knowledge of these sources of bias and the appropriate methodologies to address them is crucial when evaluating observational studies to inform patient management decisions regarding whether ACE inhibitors or ARBs are associated with greater risk from COVID-19.

These associations are commonly caused by confusion derived from social, environmental, and behavioral factors, which can be difficult to measure. Mendelian randomization is based on the selection of genetic variants that are used as instrumental variables that influence exposure patterns or are associated with an intermediate phenotype of the disease. The present work aims to discuss how to select the appropriate genetic variants as instrumental variables and to present methodological tools to deal with the limitations of this epidemiological method. The use of instrumental variables for modifiable exposures has the potential to mitigate the effects of common limitations, such as confusion, when robust genetic variants are chosen as instrumental variables.

A crucial source of violation of the internal validity of a study involves bias arising from confounding, which is always a challenge in observational research, including life course epidemiology. The increasingly popular approach of meta-analyzing individual participant data from several observational studies also brings up to discussion the problem of confounding when combining data from different populations. In this study, we review and discuss the most common sources of confounding in life course epidemiology: (i) confounding by indication, (ii) impact of baseline selection on confounding, (iii) time-varying confounding and (iv) mediator-outcome confounding. We also discuss the issue of addressing confounding in the context of an individual participant data meta-analysis.

Unfortunately, the word confounding has been used synonymously with several other terms, and it has been used to refer to at least four distinct concepts. This paper provides an overview of confounding and related concepts based on a counterfactual model of causation. In this context, which predominates in nonexperimental research, confounding is a source of bias in the estimation of causal effects. Special attention is given to the history of definitions of confounding, the distinction between confounding and confounders, problems in the control of confounding, the relations of confounding to exchangeability and collapsibility, and confounding in randomized trials.

This problem is paramount in medicine, where we would like to answer causal questions from large observational datasets like electronic health records (EHRs) and administrative claims. Modern medical data typically contain tens of thousands of covariates. Such a large set carries hope that many of the confounders are directly measured, and further hope that others are indirectly measured through their correlation with measured covariates. How can we exploit these large sets of covariates for causal inference? To help answer this question, this paper examines the performance of the large-scale propensity score (LSPS) approach on causal analysis of medical data. We demonstrate that LSPS may adjust for indirectly measured confounders by including tens of thousands of covariates that may be correlated with them. We present conditions under which LSPS removes bias due to indirectly measured confounders, and we show that LSPS may avoid bias when inadvertently adjusting for variables (like colliders) that otherwise can induce bias. We demonstrate the performance of LSPS with both simulated medical data and real medical data.

In the context of the proportional hazard Cox regression models, this problem has recently received attention with several methods being proposed. Previously, we developed an improved estimator under the incumbent two-stage residual inclusion procedure called '2SRI' by adding a Gaussian frailty in the second stage. We now consider the more complex situation in which the treatment and the unmeasured confounders can have time varying effects, illustrating the method with the case of a step function with one prespecified change point. We prove that, in situations where the effects of the unmeasured confounder or the treatment change during the follow-up, the first stage of the 2SRI algorithm induces a frailty with time varying coefficients in the second stage, which enables incumbent methods and our previously developed procedure to be improved on. A Monte Carlo simulation study demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed extension of 2SRI that we develop. We apply the new procedure to estimate the effect of endarterectomy versus carotid artery stenting on the time to death of patients suffering from carotid artery disease by using linked vascular quality initiative registry-Medicare data.

We propose a method to simultaneously address both issues in the form of a semi-parametric sensitivity analysis. In particular, our approach incorporates Bayesian Additive Regression Trees into a two-parameter sensitivity analysis strategy that assesses sensitivity of posterior distributions of treatment effects to choices of sensitivity parameters. This results in an easily interpretable framework for testing for the impact of an unmeasured confounder that also limits the number of modeling assumptions. We evaluate our approach in a large-scale simulation setting and with high blood pressure data taken from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. The model is implemented as open-source software, integrated into the treatSens package for the R statistical programming language. (c) 2016 The Authors.

This article establishes an "orthogonal" score for learning treatment effects, using observational data with a potentially large number of confounders. The estimator allows for root-n, asymptotically valid confidence intervals, despite the bias induced by the regularization. Moreover, we develop a novel hazard difference (HDi), estimator. We establish rate double robustness through the cross-fitting formulation. Numerical experiments illustrate the finite sample performance, where we observe that the cross-fitted HDi estimator has the best performance. We study the radical prostatectomy's effect on conservative prostate cancer management through the SEER-Medicare linked data.

Bias is evident when estimating influenza vaccine effectiveness, even after adjustment for claims-based indicators of illness. We explored bias reduction methods while estimating vaccine effectiveness in a cohort of adult hemodialysis patients. Using the United States Renal Data System and linked data from a commercial dialysis provider, we estimated vaccine effectiveness using a Cox proportional hazards marginal structural model of all-cause mortality before and during 3 influenza seasons in 2005/2006 through 2007/2008. To improve confounding control, we added frailty indicators to the model, measured time-varying confounders at different time intervals, and restricted the sample in multiple ways. Crude and baseline-adjusted marginal structural models remained strongly biased. Restricting to a healthier population removed some unmeasured confounding; however, this reduced the sample size, resulting in wide confidence intervals. We estimated an influenza vaccine effectiveness of 9% (hazard ratio = 0.91, 95% confidence interval: 0.72, 1.15) when bias was minimized through cohort restriction. In this study, the healthy-user bias could not be controlled through statistical adjustment; however, sample restriction reduced much of the bias.	[McGrath, Leah J.; Brookhart, M.

Potential confounding by exposure history and prior outcomes - An example from perinatal epidemiology	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; CLEARER DEFINITION; PREGNANCY OUTCOMES; CAUSAL INFERENCE; RISK; DEFECTS; TIME; BIAS	Prior pregnancy outcomes, such as spontaneous abortion and preterm birth, are often predictive of future pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, many researchers adjust for reproductive history. Although this adjustment may be appropriate for a predictive model, it is not necessarily appropriate when the goal is to obtain an unbiased estimate of the effect of exposure on disease. Reproductive history may seem to meet the conventional criteria for confounding because it is unlikely to be on the causal pathway between exposure and current outcome, is often associated with current outcome, and may be associated with exposure as well. However, whether reproductive history is a confounder or not depends on the underlying reason for its associations with exposure and current outcome. Thus, conventional methods for assessing confounding are often inadequate. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) can be used to evaluate complex scenarios for confounding when the research question is clearly defined with respect to the exposure, the outcome, and the effect estimate of interest. Special care is required when reproductive history affects future exposure. We use 5 DAGs to illustrate possible relations between reproductive history and current outcome. We assess each DAG for confounding, and identify the appropriate analytic technique. We provide a numeric example using data from the Collaborative Perinatal Project. There is no single answer as to whether reproductive history should be included in the model; the decision depends on the research question and the underlying DAG.

Methods: Using data from the CARDIA study (n = 12 174 person-observations; 6 examinations; 1985-2011) across four US cities (Birmingham, AL; Chicago, IL; Minneapolis, MN; Oakland, CA), we used instrumental-variables (IV) regression to obtain causal estimates of the longitudinal associations between the percentage of neighbourhood food stores or restaurants (per total food outlets within 1 km network distance of respondent residence) with body mass index (BMI), adjusting for individual-level socio-demographics, health behaviours, city, year, total food outlets and market-level prices. To determine the presence and extent of bias, we compared the magnitude and direction of results with ordinary least squares (OLS) and random effects (RE) regression, which do not control for residual confounding, and with fixed effects (FE) regression, which does not control for time-varying residual confounding. Results: Relative to neighbourhood supermarkets (which tend to be larger and have healthier options than grocery stores), a higher percentage of grocery stores [mean=53.4%; standard deviation (SD) = 31.8%] was positively associated with BMI [beta = 0.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.01, 0.10] using IV regression. However, associations were negligible or null using OLS (beta = -0.001; 95% CI = -0.01, 0.01), RE (beta = -0.003; 95% CI = -0.01, 0.0001) and FE (beta = -0.003; 95% CI = -0.01, 0.0002) regression. Neighbourhood convenience stores and fast-food restaurants were not associated with BMI in any model. Conclusions: Longitudinal associations between neighbourhood food outlets and BMI were greater in magnitude using a causal model, suggesting that weak findings in the literature may be due to residual confounding.

Although certain functions will require investigator intervention, confounding control is one area that can largely be automated. The high-dimensional propensity score (hd-PS) algorithm is one option for automated confounding control in longitudinal healthcare databases. In this article, we discuss the use of hd-PS for automating confounding control in sequential database cohort studies, as applied to safety monitoring systems. In particular, we discuss the robustness of the covariate selection process, the potential for over- or under-selection of variables including the possibilities of M-bias and Z-bias, the computation requirements, the practical considerations in a federated database network, and the cases where automated confounding adjustment may not function optimally. We also outline recent improvements to the algorithm and show how the algorithm has performed in several published studies. We conclude that despite certain limitations, hd-PS offers substantial advantages over non-automated alternatives in active product safety monitoring systems.

Safety surveillance and the estimation of risk in select populations: Flexible methods to control for confounding while targeting marginal comparisons via standardization	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						causal inference; electronic health records; pharmacosurveillance; propensity score; rare adverse event	PROPENSITY SCORE METHODS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; ASYMPTOTIC VARIANCE; PERFORMANCE; MODELS	We consider the critical problem of pharmacosurveillance for adverse events once a drug or medical product is incorporated into routine clinical care. When making inference on comparative safety using large-scale electronic health records, we often encounter an extremely rare binary adverse outcome with a large number of potential confounders. In this context, it is challenging to offer flexible methods to adjust for high-dimensional confounders, whereas use of the propensity score (PS) can help address this challenge by providing both confounding control and dimension reduction. Among PS methods, regression adjustment using the PS as a covariate in an outcome model has been incompletely studied and potentially misused. Previous studies have suggested that simple linear adjustment may not provide sufficient control of confounding. Moreover, no formal representation of the statistical procedure and associated inference has been detailed. In this paper, we characterize a three-step procedure, which performs flexible regression adjustment of the estimated PS followed by standardization to estimate the causal effect in a select population. We also propose a simple variance estimation method for performing inference. Through a realistic simulation mimicking data from the Food and Drugs Administration's Sentinel Initiative comparing the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta blockers on incidence of angioedema, we show that flexible regression on the PS resulted in less bias without loss of efficiency, and can outperform other methods when the PS model is correctly specified. In addition, the direct variance estimation method is a computationally fast and reliable approach for inference.

Objective: To determine the frequency and adequacy of adjustment for confounding in medical articles. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: 34 scientific medical journals with a high impact factor. Measurements: Frequency of reporting on methods used to adjust for confounding in 537 original research articles published in January 1998. Results: Of the 537 articles, 169 specified that adjustment for confounding was used. In 1 paper in 10, it was unclear which statistical method was used or for which variables adjustment was made. In 45% of papers, it was not clear how multicategory or continuous variables were treated in the analysis. inadequate reporting was less frequent if an author was affiliated with a department of statistics, epidemiology, or public health and if articles were published in journals with a high impact factor. Conclusions: Details of methods used to adjust for confounding are frequently not reported in original research articles.

Propensity score methods for time-dependent cluster confounding	BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						clustering; matching; observational study; propensity score; survival analysis	CAUSAL INFERENCE; MODELS	In observational studies, subjects are often nested within clusters. In medical studies, patients are often treated by doctors and therefore patients are regarded as nested or clustered within doctors. A concern that arises with clustered data is that cluster-level characteristics (e.g., characteristics of the doctor) are associated with both treatment selection and patient outcomes, resulting in cluster-level confounding. Measuring and modeling cluster attributes can be difficult and statistical methods exist to control for all unmeasured cluster characteristics. An assumption of these methods however is that characteristics of the cluster and the effects of those characteristics on the outcome (as well as probability of treatment assignment when using covariate balancing methods) are constant over time. In this paper, we consider methods that relax this assumption and allow for estimation of treatment effects in the presence of unmeasured time-dependent cluster confounding. The methods are based on matching with the propensity score and incorporate unmeasured time-specific cluster effects by performing matching within clusters or using fixed- or random-cluster effects in the propensity score model. The methods are illustrated using data to compare the effectiveness of two total hip devices with respect to survival of the device and a simulation study is performed that compares the proposed methods. One method that was found to perform well is matching within surgeon clusters partitioned by time. Considerations in implementing the proposed methods are discussed.

Instrumental variables as bias amplifiers with general outcome and confounding	BIOMETRIKA			English	Article						Causal inference; Directed acyclic graph; Interaction; Monotonicity; Potential outcome	PROPENSITY SCORE METHODS; CAUSAL; DISTRIBUTIONS; COLLAPSIBILITY; AMPLIFICATION; ASSOCIATION; BALANCE; BALLOON; DESIGN; MODELS	Drawing causal inference with observational studies is the central pillar of many disciplines. One sufficient condition for identifying the causal effect is that the treatment-outcome relationship is unconfounded conditional on the observed covariates. It is often believed that the more covariates we condition on, the more plausible this unconfoundedness assumption is. This belief has had a huge impact on practical causal inference, suggesting that we should adjust for all pretreatment covariates. However, when there is unmeasured confounding between the treatment and outcome, estimators adjusting for some pretreatment covariate might have greater bias than estimators that do not adjust for this covariate. This kind of covariate is called a bias amplifier, and includes instrumental variables that are independent of the confounder and affect the outcome only through the treatment. Previously, theoretical results for this phenomenon have been established only for linear models. We fill this gap in the literature by providing a general theory, showing that this phenomenon happens under a wide class of models satisfying certain monotonicity assumptions.

When there are time-varying confounders, which may include past outcomes, affected by prior exposure, standard regression methods can lead to bias. Methods such as inverse probability weighted estimation of marginal structural models have been developed to address this problem. However, in this paper we show how standard regression methods can be used, even in the presence of time-dependent confounding, to estimate the total effect of an exposure on a subsequent outcome by controlling appropriately for prior exposures, outcomes, and time-varying covariates. We refer to the resulting estimation approach as sequential conditional mean models (SCMMs), which can be fitted using generalized estimating equations. We outline this approach and describe how including propensity score adjustment is advantageous. We compare the causal effects being estimated using SCMMs and marginal structural models, and we compare the two approaches using simulations. SCMMs enable more precise inferences, with greater robustness against model misspecification via propensity score adjustment, and easily accommodate continuous exposures and interactions. A new test for direct effects of past exposures on a subsequent outcome is described.

Comparison of Instrumental Variable Analysis Using a New Instrument With Risk Adjustment Methods to Reduce Confounding by Indication	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						asthma; comparative effectiveness research; confounding factors (epidemiology); instrumental variable; propensity score; risk adjustment; therapeutics	PROPENSITY SCORE; PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT; BREAST-CANCER; ASTHMA; HETEROGENEITY; IDENTIFICATION; SELECTION; DATABASE; THERAPY; BIAS	Confounding by indication is a vexing problem, especially in evaluating treatment effects using observational data, since treatment decisions are often related to disease severity, prognosis, and frailty. To compare the ability of the instrumental variable (IV) approach with a new instrument based on the local-area practice style and risk adjustment methods, including conventional multivariate regression and propensity score adjustment, to reduce confounding by indication, the authors investigated the effects of long-term control (LTC) therapy on the occurrence of acute asthma exacerbation events among children and young adults with incident and uncontrolled persistent asthma, using Iowa Medicaid claims files from 1997-1999. Established evidence from clinical trials has demonstrated the protective benefits of LTC therapy for persistent asthma. Among patients identified (n = 4,275), those with higher asthma severity at baseline were more likely to receive LTC therapy. The multivariate regression and propensity score adjustment methods suggested that LTC therapy had no effect on the occurrence of acute exacerbation events. Estimates from the new IV approach showed that LTC therapy significantly decreased the occurrence of acute exacerbation events, which is consistent with established clinical evidence. The authors discuss how to interpret estimates from the risk adjustment and IV methods when the treatment effect is heterogeneous.

Time-Dependent Confounding in the Study of the Effects of Regular Physical Activity in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: An Application of the Marginal Structural Model	ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Confounding Factors (Epidemiology); Epidemiology; Epidemiologic Methods; Exercise; Models; Statistical; Motor Activity; Pulmonary Disease; Chronic Obstructive	BODY-COMPOSITION; RISK; MORTALITY; LIMITATION; SURVIVAL; DECLINE; DEATH; COPD	PURPOSE: Results from longitudinal studies about the association between physical activity and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may have been biased because they did not properly adjust for time-dependent confounders. Marginal structural models (MSMs) have been proposed to address this type of confounding. We sought to assess the presence of time-dependent confounding in the association between physical activity and COPD development and course by comparing risk estimates between standard statistical methods and MSMs. METHODS: By using the population-based cohort Copenhagen City Heart Study, 6,568 subjects selected from the general population in 1976 were followed up until 2004 with three repeated examinations. RESULTS: Moderate to high compared with low physical activity was associated with a reduced risk of developing COPD both in the standard analysis (odds ratio [OR] 0.76, p = 0.007) and in the MSM analysis (OR 0.79, p = 0.025). In the subgroup with COPD (n = 2,226), high physical activity was associated with a reduced risk of COPD admissions during follow-up (standard, incidence rate ratio, 0.74; p = 0.096; MSM, 0.68, p = 0.044), and with a reduced risk of mortality (standard, hazard ratio 0.80, p = 0.001; MSM, 0.81, p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: These results support the previously reported associations between physical activity and reduced risk of COPD development, hospitalizations, and mortality, thereby suggesting they were not due to time-dependent confounding.

Confounding by Season in Ecologic Studies of Seasonal Exposures and Outcomes: Examples From Estimates of Mortality Due to Influenza	ANNALS OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Seasons; Epidemiologic Methods; Models; Statistical; Influenza; Human	TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS; RESPIRATORY SYNCYTIAL VIRUS; EXCESS HOSPITAL ADMISSIONS; UNITED-STATES; AIR-POLLUTION; PNEUMONIA; EPIDEMICS; IMPACT; DISEASE; MORBIDITY	PURPOSE: Many health outcomes exhibit seasonal variation in incidence, including accidents, suicides, and infections. For seasonal outcomes it can be difficult to distinguish the causal roles played by factors that also vary seasonally, such as weather, air pollution, and pathogen circulation. METHODS: Various approaches to estimating the association between a seasonal exposure and a seasonal outcome in ecologic Studies are reviewed, using studies of influenza-related mortality as an example. Because mortality rates vary seasonally and circulation of other respiratory viruses peaks during influenza season, it is a challenge to estimate which winter deaths were caused by influenza. Results of studies that estimated the contribution of influenza to all-cause mortality using different methods on the same data are compared. RESULTS: Methods for estimating associations between season exposures and outcomes vary greatly in their advantages, disadvantages, and assumptions. Even when applied to identical data, different methods can give greatly different results for the expected contribution of influenza to all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: When the association between exposures and outcomes that vary seasonally is estimated, models must be selected carefully, keeping in mind the assumptions inherent in each model.

We derive narrower bounds by adding assumptions regarding bias due to confounding. This bias is defined as the difference between the expectation of potential outcomes for the exposed group and that for the unexposed group. We show that crude effect measures bound causal effects under the given assumptions. We then derive bounds for randomized studies with noncompliance, which are given by the per protocol effect. With perfect compliance in one treatment group, the direction of effect becomes identifiable under our assumptions. Although the assumptions are not themselves identifiable, they are nonetheless reasonable in some situations. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						selection bias; confounding; magnetic fields; wire codes; childhood leukemia; case-control studies	ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC-LEUKEMIA; CHILDHOOD-CANCER; WIRE CODES; EXPOSURE; NONRESPONDENTS; RESPONDENTS; ASSOCIATION	In contrast with several previous studies, our recent large case-control study found little association between childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and electric-power-line wire codes. Here we examine internal evidence from our study to assess the possibility that selection bias and/or confounding may have affected the findings. We compared the relation between childhood ALL and wire codes and direct measurements of magnetic fields in subjects who participated in all phases of the study with the relation in all subjects, including those who declined to allow access inside the home. We found that the odds ratio for ALL among those living in homes with very high current configurations increased by 23% when 107 "partial participants" were excluded. We found similar, but slightly smaller, increases in the odds ratios when we performed the same comparisons using direct measurements of magnetic fields, excluding subjects who allowed only a measurement outside the front door. "Partial participants" tended to be characterized by lower socioeconomic status than subjects who participated fully, suggesting possible selection bias. We also examined the relation between a large number of potential confounding variables and both proxy and direct measurements of magnetic fields. Univariate adjustment for individual variables changed the odds ratio for ALL by less than 8%, while simultaneous adjustment for several factors reduced the estimate by a maximum of 15%. We conclude that while confounding alone is unlikely to be an important source of bias in our own and previous studies of magnetic fields, selection bias may be more of a concern, particularly in light of the generally low response rates among controls in case-control studies.

A Comparison of Methods to Estimate the Hazard Ratio Under Conditions of Time-varying Confounding and Nonpositivity	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							CAUSAL INFERENCE; MORTALITY; EXPOSURE; MODEL; SELECTION; SURVIVAL; BIAS	In occupational epidemiologic studies, the healthy worker survivor effect refers to a process that leads to bias in the estimates of an association between cumulative exposure and a health outcome. In these settings, work status acts both as an intermediate and confounding variable and may violate the positivity assumption (the presence of exposed and unexposed observations in all strata of the confounder). Using Monte Carlo simulation, we assessed the degree to which crude, work-status adjusted, and weighted (marginal structural) Cox proportional hazards models are biased in the presence of time-varying confounding and nonpositivity. We simulated the data representing time-varying occupational exposure, work status, and mortality. Bias, coverage, and root mean squared error (MSE) were calculated relative to the true marginal exposure effect in a range of scenarios. For a base-case scenario, using crude, adjusted, and weighted Cox models, respectively, the hazard ratio was biased downward 19%, 9%, and 6%; 95% confidence interval coverage was 48%, 85%, and 91%; and root MSE was 0.20, 0.13, and 0.11. Although marginal structural models were less biased in most scenarios studied, neither standard nor marginal structural Cox proportional hazards models fully resolve the bias encountered under conditions of time-varying confounding and nonpositivity.

Here we show that using rich data on comorbidities and automatic variable selection strategies for selecting confounders can better control confounding within a case-control study design and provide a more solid basis for inference regarding the causal effects of drugs on HOIs. Four HOIs are examined: acute kidney injury, acute liver injury, acute myocardial infarction and gastrointestinal ulcer hospitalization. For each of these HOIs we use a previously published reference set of positive and negative control drugs to evaluate the performance of our methods. Our methods have AUCs that are often substantially higher than the AUCs of a baseline method that only uses demographic characteristics for confounding control. Our methods also give confidence intervals for causal effect parameters that cover the expected no effect value substantially more often than this baseline method. The case-control study design, unlike the self- controlled study design, can be used in the fairly typical setting of EHR databases without longitudinal information on patients. With our variable selection method, these databases can be more effectively used for the detection of ADRs.

Efforts to adjust for confounding by neighborhood using complex survey data	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						confounding; conditional logistic regression; generalized linear mixed models: misspecified mixing distribution; complex survey data: causal inference	LONGITUDINAL DATA; CLUSTERED DATA; MODELS; SELECTION	In social epidemiology, one often considers neighborhood or contextual effects on health outcomes, in addition to effects of individual exposures. This paper is concerned with the estimation of an individual exposure effect in the presence of confounding by neighborhood effects, motivated by an analysis of National health Interview Survey (NHIS) data. In the analysis, we operationalize neighborhood as the secondary sampling unit of the survey, which consists of small groups of neighboring census blocks. Thus the neighborhoods are sampled with unequal probabilities, as are individuals within neighborhoods. We develop and compare several approaches for the analysis of the effect of dichotomized individual-level education on the receipt of adequate mammography screening. In the analysis, neighborhood effects are likely to confound the individual effects, due to such factors as differential availability of health services and differential neighborhood culture. The approaches can be grouped into three broad classes: ordinary logistic regression for survey data, with either no effect or a fixed effect for each cluster; conditional logistic regression extended for survey data; and generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) regression for survey data. Standard use of GLMMs with small clusters fails to adjust for confounding by cluster (e.g. neighborhood); this motivated us to develop an adaptation. We use theory, simulation, and analyses of the NIIIS data to compare and contrast all of these methods. One conclusion is that all of the methods perform poorly when the sampling bias is strong; more research and new methods are clearly needed. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

This study aimed to investigate whether autoencoders, which are unsupervised deep learning architectures, might be leveraged to compute PS. Methods: We selected patient-level data of 128,368 first-line treated cancer patients from the Flatiron Health EHR-derived de-identified database. We trained an autoencoder architecture to learn a lower-dimensional patient representation, which we used to compute PS. To compare the performance of an autoencoder-based PS with established methods, we performed a simulation study. We assessed the balancing and adjustment performance using standardized mean differences, root mean square errors (RMSE), percent bias, and confidence interval coverage. To illustrate the application of the autoencoder-based PS, we emulated the PRONOUNCE trial by applying the trial's protocol elements within an observational database setting, comparing two chemotherapy regimens. Results: All methods but the manual variable selection approach led to well-balanced cohorts with average standardized mean differences <0.1. LASSO yielded on average the lowest deviation of resulting estimates (RMSE 0.0205) followed by the autoencoder approach (RMSE 0.0248). Altering the hyperparameter setup in sensitivity analysis, the autoencoder approach led to similar results as LASSO (RMSE 0.0203 and 0.0205, respectively). In the case study, all methods provided a similar conclusion with point estimates clustered around the null (e.g., HRautoencoder 1.01 [95% confidence interval = 0.80, 1.27] vs. HRPRONOUNCE 1.07 [0.83, 1.36]). Conclusions: Autoencoder-based PS computation was a feasible approach to control for confounding but did not perform better than some established approaches like LASSO.

In observational studies, however, any detected association between treatment ("on-medication" vs "off-medication") and the outcome (performance in the activity) might be due to confounders. In particular, causal inferences at the personalized level are especially vulnerable to confounding effects that arise in a cyclic fashion. For quick acting medications, effects can be confounded by circadian rhythms and daily routines. Using the time-of-the-day as a surrogate for these confounders and the performance measurements as captured on a smartphone, we propose a personalized statistical approach to disentangle putative treatment and "time-of-the-day" effects, that leverages conditional independence relations spanned by causal graphical models involving the treatment, time-of-the-day, and outcome variables. Our approach is based on conditional independence tests implemented via standard and temporal linear regression models. Using synthetic data, we investigate when and how residual autocorrelation can affect the standard tests, and how time series modeling (namely, ARIMA and robust regression via HAC covariance matrix estimators) can remedy these issues. In particular, our simulations illustrate that when patients perform their activities in a paired fashion, positive autocorrelation can lead to conservative results for the standard regression approach (i.e., lead to deflated true positive detection), whereas negative autocorrelation can lead to anticonservative behavior (i.e., lead to inflated false positive detection). The adoption of time series methods, on the other hand, leads to well controlled type I error rates. We illustrate the application of our methodology with data from a Parkinson's disease mobile health study.

Confounding Adjustment in Comparative Effectiveness Research Conducted Within Distributed Research Networks	MEDICAL CARE			English	Article						comparative effectiveness research; distributed research network; confounding; propensity score; disease risk score; instrumental variable; marginal structural model; pharmacoepidemiology	DISEASE RISK SCORES; PROPENSITY SCORE; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES; CAUSAL INFERENCE; SAFETY SURVEILLANCE; OUTCOMES RESEARCH; HEALTH; MORTALITY; SELECTION	Background: A distributed research network (DRN) of electronic health care databases, in which data reside behind the firewall of each data partner, can support a wide range of comparative effectiveness research (CER) activities. An essential component of a fully functional DRN is the capability to perform robust statistical analyses to produce valid, actionable evidence without compromising patient privacy, data security, or proprietary interests. Objectives and Methods: We describe the strengths and limitations of different confounding adjustment approaches that can be considered in observational CER studies conducted within DRNs, and the theoretical and practical issues to consider when selecting among them in various study settings. Results: Several methods can be used to adjust for multiple confounders simultaneously, either as individual covariates or as confounder summary scores (eg, propensity scores and disease risk scores), including: (1) centralized analysis of patient-level data, (2) case-centered logistic regression of risk set data, (3) stratified or matched analysis of aggregated data, (4) distributed regression analysis, and (5) meta-analysis of site-specific effect estimates. These methods require different granularities of information be shared across sites and afford investigators different levels of analytic flexibility. Conclusions: DRNs are growing in use and sharing of highly detailed patient-level information is not always feasible in DRNs. Methods that incorporate confounder summary scores allow investigators to adjust for a large number of confounding factors without the need to transfer potentially identifiable information in DRNs. They have the potential to let investigators perform many analyses traditionally conducted through a centralized dataset with detailed patient-level information.

J	McCandless, LC; Gustafson, P				McCandless, Lawrence C.; Gustafson, Paul			A comparison of Bayesian and Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						Bayesian analysis; causal inference; non-identifiable model; sensitivity analysis	OBSERVATIONAL DATA; BIAS; BOUNDS; MODELS; RISK	Bias from unmeasured confounding is a persistent concern in observational studies, and sensitivity analysis has been proposed as a solution. In the recent years, probabilistic sensitivity analysis using either Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis (MCSA) or Bayesian sensitivity analysis (BSA) has emerged as a practical analytic strategy when there are multiple bias parameters inputs. BSA uses Bayes theorem to formally combine evidence from the prior distribution and the data. In contrast, MCSA samples bias parameters directly from the prior distribution. Intuitively, one would think that BSA and MCSA ought to give similar results. Both methods use similar models and the same (prior) probability distributions for the bias parameters. In this paper, we illustrate the surprising finding that BSA and MCSA can give very different results. Specifically, we demonstrate that MCSA can give inaccurate uncertainty assessments (e.g. 95% intervals) that do not reflect the data's influence on uncertainty about unmeasured confounding. Using a data example from epidemiology and simulation studies, we show that certain combinations of data and prior distributions can result in dramatic prior-to-posterior changes in uncertainty about the bias parameters. This occurs because the application of Bayes theorem in a non-identifiable model can sometimes rule out certain patterns of unmeasured confounding that are not compatible with the data. Consequently, the MCSA approach may give 95% intervals that are either too wide or too narrow and that do not have 95% frequentist coverage probability. Based on our findings, we recommend that analysts use BSA for probabilistic sensitivity analysis. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding in a marginal structural Cox proportional hazards model	LIFETIME DATA ANALYSIS			English	Article						Sensitivity analysis; Selection bias; Unmeasured confounding	CAUSAL INFERENCE; LIFE EVENTS; SMOKING; EPIDEMIOLOGY; DEPRESSION; SYMPTOMS; EXPOSURE; PERIOD; BIASES; MEN	Sensitivity analysis for unmeasured confounding should be reported more often, especially in observational studies. In the standard Cox proportional hazards model, this requires substantial assumptions and can be computationally difficult. The marginal structural Cox proportional hazards model (Cox proportional hazards MSM) with inverse probability weighting has several advantages compared to the standard Cox model, including situations with only one assessment of exposure (point exposure) and time-independent confounders. We describe how simple computations provide sensitivity for unmeasured confounding in a Cox proportional hazards MSM with point exposure. This is achieved by translating the general framework for sensitivity analysis for MSMs by Robins and colleagues to survival time data. Instead of bias-corrected observations, we correct the hazard rate to adjust for a specified amount of unmeasured confounding. As an additional bonus, the Cox proportional hazards MSM is robust against bias from differential loss to follow-up. As an illustration, the Cox proportional hazards MSM was applied in a reanalysis of the association between smoking and depression in a population-based cohort of Norwegian adults. The association was moderately sensitive for unmeasured confounding.

Diagnostics for confounding in PK/PD models for oxcarbazepine	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						pharmacokinetics; pharmacodynamics; pediatric bridging; potential outcomes; Rubin's causal model; sensitivity analysis; instrumental variables; two-stage least squares	CAUSAL; INFERENCE; SMOKING	One type of phannacokinetic/pharrnacodynarnic (PK/PD) relationship that is used to characterize the therapeutic action of a drug is the relationship between some univariate summary of the plasmaconcentration-versus-time profile and the drug effect on a response outcome. Operationally, such a relationship may be observed in a large clinical trial where randomly sampled patients are randomized to different values of the concentration summary. If, under such conditions, the relationship between concentration and effect does not depend on the dose needed to attain the target concentration, such a relationship will be called a true PK/PD relationship. When the true PK/PD relationship is assessed as an object of estimation in a dose-controlled clinical trial (i.e. when dose is randomized), observed drug concentration is an outcome variable. The estimated PK/PD relationship between observed outcome and observed concentration, which we then refer to as the conventional PK/PD relationship, may be biased for the true PK/PD relationship. Because of this bias, the conventional relationship is called confounded for the true one. We show that diagnostics for confounding can be devised under reasonable assumptions. We then apply these diagnostics to PK/PD assessments of adults and children on oxcarbazepine adjunctive therapy. It was necessary to demonstrate the similarity of the true PK/PD relationships of adults and children on adjunctive therapy in order to support the approval of oxcarbazepine monotherapy in children by a bridging argument.

How Do Unobserved Confounding Mediators and Measurement Error Impact Estimated Mediation Effects and Corresponding Statistical Inferences? Introducing the R Package ConMed for Sensitivity Analysis	PSYCHOLOGICAL METHODS			English	Article						mediation model; posttreatment confounder; unobserved mediator; measurement error; sensitivity analysis; R package	CROSS-SECTIONAL ANALYSES; CAUSAL; BIAS; ROBUSTNESS; PRODUCT; IDENTIFICATION; QUANTIFY; LINK	Empirical studies often demonstrate multiple causal mechanisms potentially involving simultaneous or causally related mediators. However, researchers often use simple mediation models to understand the processes because they do not or cannot measure other theoretically relevant mediators. In such cases, another potentially relevant but unobserved mediator potentially confounds the observed mediator, thereby biasing the estimated direct and indirect effects associated with the observed mediator and threatening corresponding inferences. Additionally, researchers may not know the extent to which their measures are reliable, and accordingly, measurement error may bias estimated effects and mislead statistical inferences. Given these threats, we explore how the omission of an unobserved mediator and/or using variables with measurement error biases estimates and affects inferences associated with the observed mediator. Then, building off Frank's impact threshold for a confounding variable (ITCV), we propose a correlation-based sensitivity analysis. Lastly, we provide an R package ConMed to assess the robustness of mediation inferences given the omission of an unobserved, confounding mediator and/or measurement error.Translational Abstract Researchers across fields rely on mediation analyses to understand processes between the intervention and the outcome variable. Empirical studies regularly demonstrate the existence of multiple mediation pathways, such as through simultaneous or related mediators. However, many mediation analyses only include one mediator for various reasons and there are likely additional relevant mediators that could significantly bias estimates and inferences associated with the observed mediator. At the same time, valid statistical inferences also rely on the assumption that all the variables are measured without error, while researchers may not know the extent to which their measures are reliable. In practice, it is very likely that the omission of another confounding mediator and measurement error co-occurs. However, the extant literature on the combined effect of omitted confounders and measurement error does not evaluate cases where the confounder is a mediator; they focus on pretreatment confounders where the treatment has no impact on the omitted confounder. Therefore, we fill in the research gap by examining if/how omitting an alternative mediator and/or using variables with measurement error biases estimates and affects inferences associated with the observed mediator. We present analytical results as well as an illustrative example to demonstrate the potential consequences of omitting confounding mediator(s) given different reliability levels of observed variables. Additionally, we propose a correlation-based sensitivity analysis and provide an R package to help researchers assess the robustness of their mediation inferences given the omission of an unobserved, confounding mediator and/or measurement error.

The Importance of Scale for Spatial-Confounding Bias and Precision of Spatial Regression Estimators	STATISTICAL SCIENCE			English	Article						Epidemiology; identifiability; mixed model; penalized likelihood; random effects; spatial correlation; splines	COMMUNITY AIR-POLLUTION; TIME-SERIES; MORTALITY; MODELS; DISEASE; EXPOSURE; HEALTH; COHORT	Residuals in regression models are often spatially correlated. Prominent examples include studies in environmental epidemiology to understand the chronic health effects of pollutants. I consider the effects of residual spatial structure on the bias and precision of regression coefficients, developing a simple framework in which to understand the key issues and derive informative analytic results. When unmeasured confounding introduces spatial structure into the residuals, regression models with spatial random effects and closely-related models such as kriging and penalized splines are biased, even when the residual variance components are known. Analytic and simulation results show how the bias depends on the spatial scales of the covariate and the residual: one can reduce bias by fitting a spatial model only when there is variation in the covariate at a scale smaller than the scale of the unmeasured confounding. I also discuss how the scales of the residual and the covariate affect efficiency and uncertainty estimation when the residuals are independent of the covariate. In an application on the association between black carbon particulate matter air pollution and birth weight, controlling for large-scale spatial variation appears to reduce bias from unmeasured confounders, while increasing uncertainty in the estimated pollution effect.

Tchetgen			On semiparametric estimation of a path-specific effect in the presence of mediator-outcome confounding	BIOMETRIKA			English	Article						Causal inference; HIV/AIDS; Machine learning; Mediation; Multiple robustness; Unobserved confounding	CAUSAL; INFERENCE; MODELS	Path-specific effects constitute a broad class of mediated effects from an exposure to an outcome via one or more causal pathways along a set of intermediate variables. Most of the literature concerning estimation of mediated effects has focused on parametric models, with stringent assumptions regarding unmeasured confounding. We consider semiparametric inference of a path-specific effect when these assumptions are relaxed. In particular, we develop a suite of semiparametric estimators for the effect along a pathway through a mediator, but not through an exposure-induced confounder of that mediator. These estimators have different robustness properties, as each depends on different parts of the likelihood of the observed data. One estimator is locally semiparametric efficient and multiply robust. The latter property implies that machine learning can be used to estimate nuisance functions. We demonstrate these properties, as well as finite-sample properties of all the estimators, in a simulation study. We apply our method to an HIV study, in which we estimate the effect comparing two drug treatments on a patient's average log CD4 count mediated by the patient's level of adherence, but not by previous experience of toxicity, which is clearly affected by which treatment the patient is assigned to and may confound the effect of the patient's level of adherence on their virologic outcome.

Even in randomized studies the mediator may still be correlated with unobserved prognostic variables that affect the outcome, in which case the mediator's role in the causal process may not be inferred without bias. In the behavioural and social science literature very little attention has been given so far to the causal assumptions required for moderated mediation analysis. In this paper we focus on the index for moderated mediation, which measures by how much the mediated effect is larger or smaller for varying levels of the moderator. We show that in linear models this index can be estimated without bias in the presence of unmeasured common causes of the moderator, mediator and outcome under certain conditions. Importantly, one can thus use the test for moderated mediation to support evidence for mediation under less stringent confounding conditions. We illustrate our findings with data from a randomized experiment assessing the impact of being primed with social deception upon observer responses to others' pain, and from an observational study of individuals who ended a romantic relationship assessing the effect of attachment anxiety during the relationship on mental distress 2years after the break-up.

The two-stage least squares instrumental variables procedure is frequently used but is not applicable to time-to-event data if some observations are censored. We develop a simultaneous equations model to account for unmeasured confounding of the effect of treatment on survival time subject to censoring. The identification of the treatment effect is assisted by instrumental variables (variables related to treatment but conditional on treatment, not to the outcome) and the assumed bivariate distribution underlying the data-generating process. The methodology is illustrated on data from an observational study of time to death following endovascular or open repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. As the instrumental variable and the distributional assumptions cannot be jointly assessed from the observed data, we evaluate the sensitivity of the results to these assumptions.

Adjusting for unmeasured confounding in nonrandomized longitudinal studies: a methodological review	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Review						Method review; Unmeasured confounding; Unobserved confounding; Longitudinal; Observational data; Electronic health records	PROPENSITY SCORE METHODS; PANEL-DATA; BIAS; ADJUSTMENT; MODELS	Objectives: Motivated by recent calls to use electronic health records for research, we reviewed the application and development of methods for addressing the bias from unmeasured confounding in longitudinal data. Study Design and Setting: Methodological review of existing literature. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for articles addressing the threat to causal inference from unmeasured confounding in nonrandomized longitudinal health data through quasi-experimental analysis. Results: Among the 121 studies included for review, 84 used instrumental variable analysis (IVA), of which 36 used lagged or historical instruments. Difference-in-differences (DiD) and fixed effects (FE) models were found in 29 studies. Five of these combined IVA with DiD or FE to try to mitigate for time-dependent confounding. Other less frequently used methods included prior event rate ratio adjustment, regression discontinuity nested within pre-post studies, propensity score calibration, perturbation analysis, and negative control outcomes. Conclusion: Well-established econometric methods such as DiD and IVA are commonly used to address unmeasured confounding in nonrandomized longitudinal studies, but researchers often fail to take full advantage of available longitudinal information. A range of promising new methods have been developed, but further studies are needed to understand their relative performance in different contexts before they can be recommended for widespread use.

Examining the Error of Mis-Specifying Nonlinear Confounding Effect With Application on Accelerometer-Measured Physical Activity	RESEARCH QUARTERLY FOR EXERCISE AND SPORT			English	Article						Causality; confounding factors; simulation; statistical models	MODEL FORM; ADJUST; TIME	Purpose: Some confounders are nonlinearly associated with dependent variables, but they are often adjusted using a linear term. The purpose of this study was to examine the error of mis-specifying the nonlinear confounding effect. Methods: We carried out a simulation study to investigate the effect of adjusting for a nonlinear confounder in the estimation of a causal relationship between the exposure and outcome in 3 ways: using a linear term, binning into 5 equal-size categories, or using a restricted cubic spline of the confounder. Continuous, binary, and survival outcomes were simulated. We examined the confounder across varying measurement error. In addition, we performed a real data analysis examining the 3 strategies to handle the nonlinear effects of accelerometer-measured physical activity in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2006 data. Results: The mis-specification of a nonlinear confounder had little impact on causal effect estimation for continuous outcomes. For binary and survival outcomes, this mis-specification introduced bias, which could be eliminated using spline adjustment only when there is small measurement error of the confounder. Real data analysis showed that the associations between high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes and mortality adjusted for physical activity with restricted cubic spline were about 3% to 11% larger than their counterparts adjusted with a linear term. Conclusion: For continuous outcomes, confounders with nonlinear effects can be adjusting with a linear term. Spline adjustment should be used for binary and survival outcomes on confounders with small measurement error.

We demonstrate how prior knowledge unique to the multi-outcome setting can be leveraged to strengthen causal conclusions beyond what can be achieved from analyzing individual outcomes in isolation. We argue that it is often reasonable to make a shared confounding assumption, under which residual dependence amongst outcomes can be used to simplify and sharpen sensitivity analyses. We focus on a class of factor models for which we can bound the causal effects for all outcomes conditional on a single sensitivity parameter that represents the fraction of treatment variance explained by unobserved confounders. We characterize how causal ignorance regions shrink under additional prior assumptions about the presence of null control outcomes, and provide new approaches for quantifying the robustness of causal effect estimates. Finally, we illustrate our sensitivity analysis workflow in practice, in an analysis of both simulated data and a case study with data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).

Specifically, the existence of multiple relevant versions of treatment has implications for the selection of confounders. To illustrate this, we estimate the effect of organ transplantation using grafts from donors who died due to anoxic drug overdose, on recipient graft survival in the US. We describe how explicitly outlining the target trial (i.e. the hypothetical randomized trial which would answer the causal question of interest) to be emulated by an observational study analysis helps conceptualize treatment versions, guides selection of appropriate adjustment variables, and helps clarify the settings in which causal effects of compound treatments will be of value to decision-makers.

Methods for dealing with time-dependent confounding	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						time-dependent confounding; g-computation formula; inverse probability weighting; g-estimation; marginal structural model; structural nested model	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; DOUBLY ROBUST ESTIMATION; CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE; CAUSAL INFERENCE; G-COMPUTATION; RISK-FACTORS; MORTALITY; SELECTION; SURVIVAL	Longitudinal studies, where data are repeatedly collected on subjects over a period, are common in medical research. When estimating the effect of a time-varying treatment or exposure on an outcome of interest measured at a later time, standard methods fail to give consistent estimators in the presence of time-varying confounders if those confounders are themselves affected by the treatment. Robins and colleagues have proposed several alternative methods that, provided certain assumptions hold, avoid the problems associated with standard approaches. They include the g-computation formula, inverse probability weighted estimation of marginal structural models and g-estimation of structural nested models.

J	Austin, PC				Austin, Peter C.			An Introduction to Propensity Score Methods for Reducing the Effects of Confounding in Observational Studies	MULTIVARIATE BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH			English	Article							MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; LOGISTIC-REGRESSION; UNTREATED SUBJECTS; BIAS REDUCTION; PERFORMANCE; ADJUSTMENT; SELECTION; BALANCE; SUBCLASSIFICATION; STRATEGIES	The propensity score is the probability of treatment assignment conditional on observed baseline characteristics. The propensity score allows one to design and analyze an observational (nonrandomized) study so that it mimics some of the particular characteristics of a randomized controlled trial. In particular, the propensity score is a balancing score: conditional on the propensity score, the distribution of observed baseline covariates will be similar between treated and untreated subjects. I describe 4 different propensity score methods: matching on the propensity score, stratification on the propensity score, inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score, and covariate adjustment using the propensity score. I describe balance diagnostics for examining whether the propensity score model has been adequately specified. Furthermore, I discuss differences between regression-based methods and propensity score-based methods for the analysis of observational data. I describe different causal average treatment effects and their relationship with propensity score analyses.

The problem of unmeasured confounding in settings with multiple treatments is most common in statistical genetics and bioinformatics settings, where researchers have developed many successful statistical strategies without engaging deeply with the causal aspects of the problem. Recently there have been a number of attempts to bridge the gap between these statistical approaches and causal inference, but these attempts have either been shown to be flawed or have relied on fully parametric assumptions. In this article, we propose two strategies for identifying and estimating causal effects of multiple treatments in the presence of unmeasured confounding. The auxiliary variables approach leverages variables that are not causally associated with the outcome; in the case of a univariate confounder, our method only requires one auxiliary variable, unlike existing instrumental variable methods that would require as many instruments as there are treatments. An alternative null treatments approach relies on the assumption that at least half of the confounded treatments have no causal effect on the outcome, but does not require a priori knowledge of which treatments are null. Our identification strategies do not impose parametric assumptions on the outcome model and do not rest on estimation of the confounder. This article extends and generalizes existing work on unmeasured confounding with a single treatment and models commonly used in bioinformatics. for this article are available online.

We examined a cohort of 24,680 new users who were 4-17 years of age at the incident dispensing from the Population-Based Effectiveness in Asthma and Lung Diseases (PEAL) Network of 5 commercial health plans and TennCare, the Tennessee Medicaid program, during the period January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2010. The 3 methods yielded similar results, indicating that pediatric patients treated with leukotriene antagonists were no more likely than those treated with inhaled corticosteroids to experience adverse outcomes. Children in the TennCare population who had a diagnosis of allergic rhinitis and who then initiated the use of leukotriene antagonists were less likely to experience an asthma-related emergency department visit. A plausible explanation is that our data set is large enough that the 2 advanced propensity score-based analyses do not have advantages over the traditional covariate-adjusted regression approach. We provide important observations on how to correctly apply the methods in observational data analysis and suggest statistical research areas that need more work to guide implementation.

When a treatment is prescribed depending on the biomarker, confounding by indication might be introduced if the treatment modifies the marker profile and risk of failure. Objective Our aim was to highlight the flexibility of a two-stage model fitted within a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo framework. For this purpose, we monitored the prostate-specific antigens in prostate cancer patients treated with external beam radiation therapy. In the presence of rising prostate-specific antigens after external beam radiation therapy, salvage hormone therapy can be prescribed to reduce both the prostate-specific antigens concentration and the risk of clinical failure, an illustration of confounding by indication. We focused on the assessment of the prognostic value of hormone therapy and prostate-specific antigens trajectory on the risk of failure. Methods We used a two-stage model within a Bayesian framework to assess the role of the prostate-specific antigens profile on clinical failure while accounting for a secondary treatment prescribed by indication. We modeled prostate-specific antigens using a hierarchical piecewise linear trajectory with a random changepoint. Residual prostate-specific antigens variability was expressed as a function of prostate-specific antigens concentration. Covariates in the survival model included hormone therapy, baseline characteristics, and individual predictions of the prostate-specific antigens nadir and timing and prostate-specific antigens slopes before and after the nadir as provided by the longitudinal process. Results We showed positive associations between an increased prostate-specific antigens nadir, an earlier changepoint and a steeper post-nadir slope with an increased risk of failure. Importantly, we highlighted a significant benefit of hormone therapy, an effect that was not observed when the prostate-specific antigens trajectory was not accounted for in the survival model. Conclusion Our modeling strategy was particularly flexible and accounted for multiple complex features of longitudinal and survival data, including the presence of a random changepoint and a time-dependent covariate.

J	Jackson, JW				Jackson, John W.			Diagnostics for Confounding of Time-varying and Other Joint Exposures	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; SELECTION BIAS; DIAGRAMS; OUTCOMES; WEIGHTS	The effects of joint exposures (or exposure regimes) include those of adhering to assigned treatment versus placebo in a randomized controlled trial, duration of exposure in a cohort study, interactions between exposures, and direct effects of exposure, among others. Unlike the setting of a single point exposure (e.g., propensity score matching), there are few tools to describe confounding for joint exposures or how well a method resolves it. Investigators need tools that describe confounding in ways that are conceptually grounded and intuitive for those who read, review, and use applied research to guide policy. We revisit the implications of exchangeability conditions that hold in sequentially randomized trials, and the bias structure that motivates the use of g-methods, such as marginal structural models. From these, we develop covariate balance diagnostics for joint exposures that can (1) describe time-varying confounding, (2) assess whether covariates are predicted by prior exposures given their past, the indication for g-methods, and (3) describe residual confounding after inverse probability weighting. For each diagnostic, we present time-specific metrics that encompass a wide class of joint exposures, including regimes of multivariate time-varying exposures in censored data, with multivariate point exposures as a special case. We outline how to estimate these directly or with regression and how to average them over person-time. Using a simulated example, we show how these metrics can be presented graphically. This conceptually grounded framework can potentially aid the transparent design, analysis, and reporting of studies that examine joint exposures. We provide easy-to-use tools to implement it.

The impact of unmeasured within- and between-cluster confounding on the bias of effect estimatorsof a continuous exposure	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Bias formula; causal inference; instrumental variables; linear mixed model; observational study; unmeasured confounders	DIALYSIS OUTCOMES; PRACTICE PATTERNS; WEAK INSTRUMENTS; ANEMIA; IDENTIFICATION; PREFERENCE	Unmeasured confounding almost always exists in observational studies and can bias estimates of exposure effects. Instrumental variable methods are popular choices in combating unmeasured confounding to obtain less biased effect estimates. However, we demonstrate that alternative methods may give less biased estimates depending on the nature of unmeasured confounding. Treatment preferences of clusters (e.g. physician practices) are the most frequently used instruments in instrumental variable analyses. These preference-based instrumental variable analyses are usually conducted on data clustered by region, hospital/facility, or physician, where unmeasured confounding often occurs within or between clusters. We aim to quantify the impact of unmeasured confounding on the bias of effect estimators in instrumental variable analysis, as well as several common alternative methods including ordinary least squares regression, linear mixed models, and fixed-effect models to study the effect of a continuous exposure (e.g. treatment dose) on a continuous outcome. We derive closed-form expressions of asymptotic bias of estimators from these four methods in the presence of unmeasured within- and/or between-cluster confounders. Simulations demonstrate that the asymptotic bias formulae well approximate bias in finite samples for all methods. The bias formulae show that instrumental variable analyses can provide consistent estimates when unmeasured within-cluster confounding exists, but not when between-cluster confounding exists. On the other hand, fixed-effect models and linear mixed models can provide consistent estimates when unmeasured between-cluster confounding exits, but not for within-cluster confounding. Whether instrumental variable analyses are advantageous in reducing bias over fixed-effect models and linear mixed models depends on the extent of unmeasured within-cluster confounding relative to between-cluster confounding. Furthermore, the impact of unmeasured between-cluster confounding on instrumental variable analysis estimates is larger than the impact of unmeasured within-cluster confounding on fixed-effect model and linear mixed model estimates. We illustrate the use of these methods in estimating the effect of erythropoiesis stimulating agents on hemoglobin levels. Our findings provide guidance for choosing appropriate methods to combat the dominant types of unmeasured confounders and help interpret statistical results in the context of unmeasured confounding.

J	Nojiri, S				Nojiri, Shuko			Bias and Confounding: Pharmacoepidemiological Study Using Administrative Database	YAKUGAKU ZASSHI-JOURNAL OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN			Japanese	Review						bias; confounding factor; database; epidemiology; pharmacoepidemiology	ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION; MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; PROPENSITY SCORE METHODS; IMMORTAL TIME BIAS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES; COMORBIDITY SCORES; SELECTION BIAS; CASE-CROSSOVER; RISK	The provision of health care frequently creates digitalized data such as hospital-based electronic data, medication prescription records, and claims data collectively termed "administrative database research". The data source and analytical opportunities for study create risks that can lead to misinterpretation or bias the results. This review serves as an introduction to the concept of bias and confounding to help researchers conduct methodologically sound pharmacoepidemiologic research projects using administrative databases. Beyond general considerations for observational study, there are several unique issues related to database research that should be addressed. The risks of uninterpretable or biased results can be minimized by: providing a robust description of the data tables used; focusing on why and how they were created; measuring and reporting the accuracy of diagnostic and procedural codes used; and properly accounting for any time-dependent nature of variables. The hallmark of good research is rigorously careful analysis and interpretation. The promise for value of real world evidence using databases in medical decision making must be balanced against concerns related to observational inherited limitations for bias and confounding. Researchers should aim to avoid bias in the design of a study, adjust for confounding, and discuss the effects of residual bias on the results.

Effects of Omitting Non-confounding Predictors From General Relative-Risk Models for Binary Outcomes	JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						bias; binary outcomes; general relative-risk model; generalized nonlinear model; logistic regression; omitted covariate	SELECTING CONTROLS; BREAST-CANCER; RADIATION; EFFICIENCY; COVARIATE; TIME	Background: The effects, in terms of bias and precision, of omitting non-confounding predictive covariates from generalized linear models have been well studied, and it is known that such omission results in attenuation bias but increased precision with logistic regression. However, many epidemiologic risk analyses utilize alternative models that are not based on a linear predictor, and the effect of omitting non-confounding predictive covariates from such models has not been characterized. Methods: We employed simulation to study the effects on risk estimation of omitting non-confounding predictive covariates from an excess relative risk (ERR) model and a general additive-multiplicative relative-risk mixture model for binary outcome data in a case-control setting. We also compared the results to the effects with ordinary logistic regression. Results: For these commonly employed alternative relative-risk models, the bias was similar to that with logistic regression when the risk was small. More generally, the bias and standard error of the risk-parameter estimates demonstrated patterns that are similar to those with logistic regression, but with greater magnitude depending on the true value of the risk. The magnitude of bias and standard error had little relation to study size or underlying disease prevalence. Conclusions: Prior conclusions regarding omitted covariates in logistic regression models can be qualitatively applied to the ERR and the general additive-multiplicative relative-risk mixture model without substantial change. Quantitatively, however, these alternative models may have slightly greater omitted-covariate bias, depending on the magnitude of the true risk being estimated.

Investigation of the structure and magnitude of time-varying uncontrolled confounding in simulated cohort data analyzed using g-computation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Simulation; g-computation; time-varying; uncontrolled confounding; marginal structural model	CAUSAL INFERENCE; MODELS	Background When estimating the effect of time-varying exposures on longer-term outcomes, the assumption of conditional exchangeability or no uncontrolled confounding extends beyond baseline confounding to include time-varying confounding. We illustrate the structures and magnitude of uncontrolled time-varying confounding in exposure effect estimates obtained from g-computation when sequential conditional exchangeability is violated.Methods We used directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to depict time-varying uncontrolled confounding. We performed simulations and used g-computation to quantify the effects of each time-varying exposure for each DAG type. Models adjusting all time-varying confounders were considered the true (bias-adjusted) estimate. The exclusion of time-varying uncontrolled confounders represented the biased effect estimate and an unmet 'no uncontrolled confounding' assumption. True and biased estimates were compared across DAGs, with different magnitudes of uncontrolled confounding.Results Time-varying uncontrolled confounding can present in several scenarios, including relationships into subsequently measured exposure(s), outcome, unmeasured confounder(s) and other measured confounder(s). In simulations, effect estimates obtained from g-computation were more biased in DAGs when the uncontrolled confounders were directly related to the outcome. Complex DAGs that included relationships between uncontrolled confounders and other variables and relationships where exposures caused uncontrolled confounders at the next time point resulted in the most biased effect estimates. In these complex DAGs, excluding uncontrolled confounders affected the multiple effect estimates.Conclusions Time-varying uncontrolled confounding has the potential to substantially impact observed effect estimates. Given the importance of longitudinal studies in advising public health, the impact of time-varying uncontrolled confounding warrants more recognition and evaluation using quantitative bias analysis.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS FOR UNMEASURED CONFOUNDING IN COARSE STRUCTURAL NESTED MEAN MODELS	STATISTICA SINICA			English	Article						Censoring; confounding by indication; estimating equations; HIV/AIDS research; non-ignorable; sequential randomization	MISSING DATA; NONCOMPLIANCE; MORTALITY; INFECTION; INFERENCE; THERAPY; IMPACT; TRIALS; TIME; BIAS	Coarse Structural Nested Mean Models (SNMMs, Robins (2000)) and G-estimation can be used to estimate the causal effect of a time-varying treatment from longitudinal observational studies. However, they rely on an untestable assumption of no unmeasured confounding. In the presence of unmeasured confounders, the unobserved potential outcomes are not missing at random, and standard G-estimation leads to biased effect estimates. To remedy this, we investigate the sensitivity of G-estimators of coarse SNMMs to unmeasured confounding, assuming a nonidentifiable bias function which quantifies the impact of unmeasured confounding on the average potential outcome. We present adjusted G-estimators of coarse SNMM parameters and prove their consistency, under the bias modeling for unmeasured confounding. We present a sensitivity analysis for the effect of the ART initiation time on the mean CD4 count at year 2 after infection in HIV-positive patients, based on the prospective Acute and Early Disease Research Program.

The optimal strategy for evaluating a disease risk score (DRS) model's ability to control confounding is less clear. DRS models cannot be evaluated through balance checks within the full population, and they are usually assessed through prediction diagnostics and goodness-of-fit tests. A proposed alternative is the "dry-run" analysis, which divides the unexposed population into "pseudo-exposed" and "pseudo-unexposed" groups so that differences on observed covariates resemble differences between the actual exposed and unexposed populations. With no exposure effect separating the pseudo-exposed and pseudo-unexposed groups, a DRS model is evaluated by its ability to retrieve an unconfounded null estimate after adjustment in this pseudo-population. We used simulations and an empirical example to compare traditional DRS performance metrics with the dry-run validation. In simulations, the dry run often improved assessment of confounding control, compared with the C statistic and goodness-of-fit tests. In the empirical example, PS and DRS matching gave similar results and showed good performance in terms of covariate balance (PS matching) and controlling confounding in the dry-run analysis (DRS matching). The dry-run analysis may prove useful in evaluating confounding control through DRS models.

J	Gustafson, P; Greenland, S				Gustafson, Paul; Greenland, Sander			The performance of random coefficient regression in accounting for residual confounding	BIOMETRICS			English	Article						Bayesian analysis; bias; confounding; epidemiology; hierarchical models; identifiability; mixed models; observational studies; random coefficient regression	MAXIMUM-LIKELIHOOD; PRIOR INFORMATION; PREVALENCE; ABSENCE; IDENTIFIABILITY; PRIORS; TESTS	Greenland (2000, Biometrics 56, 915-921) describes the use of random coefficient regression to adjust for residual confounding in a particular setting. We examine this setting further, giving theoretical and empirical results concerning the frequentist and Bayesian performance of random coefficient regression. Particularly, we compare estimators based on this adjustment for residual confounding to estimators based on the assumption of no residual confounding. This devolves to comparing an estimator from a nonidentified but more realistic model to an estimator from a less realistic but identified model. The approach described by Gustafson (2005, Statistical Science 20, 111-140) is used to quantify the performance of a Bayesian estimator arising from a nonidentified model. From both theoretical calculations and simulations we find support for the idea that superior performance can be obtained by replacing unrealistic identifying constraints with priors that allow modest departures from those constraints. In terms of point-estimator bias this superiority arises when the extent of residual confounding is substantial, but the advantage is much broader in terms of interval estimation. The benefit from modeling residual confounding is maintained when the prior distributions employed only roughly correspond to reality, for the standard identifying constraints are equivalent to priors that typically correspond much worse.

The problem of assessing the adequacy of model fit when the expectations are small is addressed by analytical calculations and by simulation. The method is illustrated with data from the national register of childhood tumours. Design - The tumour data are recorded in a national register. Setting - England, Scotland, and Wales. Subjects - The cases considered are all children registered with leukaemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma under the age of 15 years between 1966-87. Main results - The methods show a significant variation of leukaemia incidence in relation to the Registrar General's standard region and a negative association with socioeconomic deprivation, as measured by the Townsend index. After allowing for these variables, the incidence seems to be reasonably homogeneous throughout the population, in the sense that the residual deviance does not seem to be much larger than would be expected by chance. Conclusions - The methods described have major advantages over standardisation in controlling for confounding, both in terms of flexibility of factor selection and assessment and also in the ability to determine whether there is residual variability of incidence after allowing for these factors.

Confounding by Dietary Patterns of the Inverse Association Between Alcohol Consumption and Type 2 Diabetes Risk	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						alcohol drinking; bias (epidemiology); confounding factors (epidemiology); diabetes mellitus; type 2; diet; factor analysis; statistical; least-squares analysis; proportional hazards models	PROPENSITY SCORE; DRINKING PATTERNS; HEART-DISEASE; VALIDITY; REPRODUCIBILITY; MELLITUS; BIAS	The ability to interpret epidemiologic observations is limited because of potential residual confounding by correlated dietary components. Dietary pattern analyses by factor analysis or partial least squares may overcome the limitation. To examine confounding by dietary pattern as well as standard risk factors and selected nutrients, the authors modeled the longitudinal association between alcohol consumption and 7-year risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus in 2,879 healthy adults enrolled in the Framingham Offspring Study (1991-2001) by Cox proportional hazard models. After adjustment for standard risk factors, consumers of >= 9.0 drinks/week had a significantly lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus compared with abstainers (hazard ratio = 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.27, 0.81). Adjustment for selected nutrients had little effect on the hazard ratio, whereas adjustment for dietary pattern variables by factor analysis significantly shifted the hazard ratio away from null (hazard ratio = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.64) by 40.0% (95% CI: 16.8, 57.0; P = 0.002). Dietary pattern variables by partial least squares showed similar results. Therefore, the observed inverse association, consistent with past studies, was confounded by dietary patterns, and this confounding was not captured by individual nutrient adjustment. The data suggest that alcohol intake, not dietary patterns associated with alcohol intake, is responsible for the observed inverse association with type 2 diabetes mellitus risk.

Confounding and regression adjustment in difference-in-differences studies	HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						difference&#8208; in&#8208; differences; matching; parallel trends; regression adjustment; time&#8208; varying confounding	INTERACTION TERMS; MODELS	Objective To define confounding bias in difference-in-difference studies and compare regression- and matching-based estimators designed to correct bias due to observed confounders. Data sources We simulated data from linear models that incorporated different confounding relationships: time-invariant covariates with a time-varying effect on the outcome, time-varying covariates with a constant effect on the outcome, and time-varying covariates with a time-varying effect on the outcome. We considered a simple setting that is common in the applied literature: treatment is introduced at a single time point and there is no unobserved treatment effect heterogeneity. Study design We compared the bias and root mean squared error of treatment effect estimates from six model specifications, including simple linear regression models and matching techniques. Data collection Simulation code is provided for replication. Principal findings Confounders in difference-in-differences are covariates that change differently over time in the treated and comparison group or have a time-varying effect on the outcome. When such a confounding variable is measured, appropriately adjusting for this confounder (ie, including the confounder in a regression model that is consistent with the causal model) can provide unbiased estimates with optimal SE. However, when a time-varying confounder is affected by treatment, recovering an unbiased causal effect using difference-in-differences is difficult. Conclusions Confounding in difference-in-differences is more complicated than in cross-sectional settings, from which techniques and intuition to address observed confounding cannot be imported wholesale. Instead, analysts should begin by postulating a causal model that relates covariates, both time-varying and those with time-varying effects on the outcome, to treatment. This causal model will then guide the specification of an appropriate analytical model (eg, using regression or matching) that can produce unbiased treatment effect estimates. We emphasize the importance of thoughtful incorporation of covariates to address confounding bias in difference-in-difference studies.

Causation and familial confounding as explanations for the associations of polygenic risk scores with breast cancer: Evidence from innovative ICE FALCON and ICE CRISTAL analyses	GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article; Early Access						breast cancer; causation; familial confounding; family data; ICE CRISTAL; ICE FALCON; siblings	GENETIC SUSCEPTIBILITY; MAMMOGRAPHIC DENSITY; BOADICEA MODEL; WOMEN; AGE; INFERENCE; INSIGHTS; HISTORY; TWIN	A polygenic risk score (PRS) combines the associations of multiple genetic variants that could be due to direct causal effects, indirect genetic effects, or other sources of familial confounding. We have developed new approaches to assess evidence for and against causation by using family data for pairs of relatives (Inference about Causation from Examination of FAmiliaL CONfounding [ICE FALCON]) or measures of family history (Inference about Causation from Examining Changes in Regression coefficients and Innovative STatistical AnaLyses [ICE CRISTAL]). Inference is made from the changes in regression coefficients of relatives' PRSs or PRS and family history before and after adjusting for each other. We applied these approaches to two breast cancer PRSs and multiple studies and found that (a) for breast cancer diagnosed at a young age, for example, <50 years, there was no evidence that the PRSs were causal, while (b) for breast cancer diagnosed at later ages, there was consistent evidence for causation explaining increasing amounts of the PRS-disease association. The genetic variants in the PRS might be in linkage disequilibrium with truly causal variants and not causal themselves. These PRSs cause minimal heritability of breast cancer at younger ages. There is also evidence for nongenetic factors shared by first-degree relatives that explain breast cancer familial aggregation. Familial associations are not necessarily due to genes, and genetic associations are not necessarily causal.

Use of instrumental variables in the analysis of generalized linear models in the presence of unmeasured confounding with applications to epidemiological research	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						instrumental variables analysis; generalized linear models; epidemiology generalized method of moments; unmeasured confounding	HEART-FAILURE; MANAGEMENT; MOMENTS; GUIDELINES; MORTALITY; DISEASE	A major, often unstated, concern of researchers carrying out epidemiological studies of medical therapy is the potential impact on validity if estimates of treatment are biased due to unmeasured confounders. One technique for obtaining consistent estimates of treatment effects in the presence of unmeasured confounders is instrumental variables analysis (IVA). This technique has been well developed in the econometrics literature and is being increasingly used in epidemiological studies. However, the approach to IVA that is most commonly used in such studies is based on linear models, while many epidemiological applications make use of non-linear models, specifically generalized linear models (GLMs) such as logistic or Poisson regression. Here we present a simple method for applying IVA within the class of GLMs using the generalized method of moments approach. We explore some of the theoretical properties of the method and illustrate its use within both a simulation example and an epidemiological study where unmeasured confounding is suspected to be present. We estimate the effects of beta-blocker therapy on one-year all-cause mortality after an incident hospitalization for heart failure, in the absence of data describing disease severity, which is believed to be a confounder.

However, this framework is not insulated from spatial confounding, a topic of significant interest in cancer epidemiology, where the latent correlation between the spatial random effects and fixed effects (such as covariates), often lead to misleading interpretation. Aims To introduce three popular approaches (RHZ,HHandSPOCK; details in paper) often employed to tackle spatial confounding, and illustrate their implementation in cancer research via the popular statistical softwareR. Methods As a solution to alleviate spatial confounding, restricted spatial regressions are constructed by either projecting the latent effect onto the orthogonal space of covariates, or by displacing the spatial locations. Popular parametric count data models, such as the Poisson, generalized Poisson and negative binomial, were considered for the areal count responses, while the spatial association is quantified via the conditional autoregressive (CAR) model. Our method of inference in Bayesian, sometimes aided by the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) to accelerate computing. The methods are implemented in theRpackageRASCOavailable from the first author'sGitHubpage. Results The results reveal that all three methods perform well in alleviating the bias and variance inflation present in the spatial models. The effects of spatial confounding were also explored, which, if ignored in practice, may lead to wrong conclusions. Conclusion Spatial confounding continues to remain a critical bottleneck in deriving precise inference from spatial DM models. Hence, its effects must be investigated, and mitigated. Several approaches are available in the literature, and they produce trustworthy results. The central contribution of this paper is providing the practitioners theRpackageRASCO, capable of fitting a large number of spatial models, as well as their restricted versions.	[Azevedo, Douglas R.

PROG-IMT Study Grp	Multiple imputation for handling systematically missing confounders in meta-analysis of individual participant data	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						missing data; IPD meta-analysis; multilevel model; multiple imputation: chained equations	INTIMA-MEDIA THICKNESS; PATIENT DATA; CAROTID ATHEROSCLEROSIS; RISK; SURVIVAL; MODEL; PROGRESSION; PREDICTION; DISEASE; TRIALS	A variable is systematically missing' if it is missing for all individuals within particular studies in an individual participant data meta-analysis. When a systematically missing variable is a potential confounder in observational epidemiology, standard methods either fail to adjust the exposure-disease association for the potential confounder or exclude studies where it is missing. We propose a new approach to adjust for systematically missing confounders based on multiple imputation by chained equations. Systematically missing data are imputed via multilevel regression models that allow for heterogeneity between studies. A simulation study compares various choices of imputation model. An illustration is given using data from eight studies estimating the association between carotid intima media thickness and subsequent risk of cardiovascular events. Results are compared with standard methods and also with an extension of a published method that exploits the relationship between fully adjusted and partially adjusted estimated effects through a multivariate random effects meta-analysis model. We conclude that multiple imputation provides a practicable approach that can handle arbitrary patterns of systematic missingness. Bias is reduced by including sufficient between-study random effects in the imputation model. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

J	Sheikh, MA				Sheikh, Mashhood Ahmed			Confounding and Statistical Significance of Indirect Effects: Childhood Adversity, Education, Smoking, and Anxious and Depressive Symptomatology	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						directeffect; proportion of mediated effect; decomposition; mediation; confounding; anxiety; depression; longitudinal	LIFE-COURSE PATHWAYS; MENTAL-HEALTH; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; MAJOR DEPRESSION; EARLY ADULTHOOD; PHYSICAL HEALTH; YOUNG ADULTHOOD; SOCIAL SUPPORT; OLDER-ADULTS	The life course perspective, the risky families model, and stress-and-coping models provide the rationale for assessing the role of smoking as a mediator in the association between childhood adversity and anxious and depressive symptomatology (ADS) in adulthood. However, no previous study has assessed the independent mediating role of smoking in the association between childhood adversity and ADS in adulthood. Moreover, the importance of mediator-response confounding variables has rarely been demonstrated empirically in social and psychiatric epidemiology. The aim of this paper was to (i) assess the mediating role of smoking in adulthood in the association between childhood adversity and ADS in adulthood, and (ii) assess the change in estimates due to different mediator-response confounding factors (education, alcohol intake, and social support). The present analysis used data collected from 1994 to 2008 within the framework of the Tromso Study (N = 4,530), a representative prospective cohort study of men and women. Seven childhood adversities (low mother's education, low father's education, low financial conditions, exposure to passive smoke, psychological abuse, physical abuse, and substance abuse distress) were used to create a childhood adversity score. Smoking status was measured at a mean age of 54.7 years (Tromso IV), and ADS in adulthood was measured at a mean age of 61.7 years (Tromso V). Mediation analysis was used to assess the indirect effect and the proportion of mediated effect (%) of childhood adversity on ADS in adulthood via smoking in adulthood. The test-retest reliability of smoking was good (Kappa: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.63; 0.71) in this sample. Childhood adversity was associated with a 10% increased risk of smoking in adulthood (Relative risk: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.03; 1.18), and both childhood adversity and smoking in adulthood were associated with greater levels of ADS in adulthood (p < 0.001). Smoking in adulthood did not significantly mediate the association between childhood adversity and ADS in adulthood. However, when education was excluded as a mediator-response confounding variable, the indirect effect of childhood adversity on ADS in adulthood was statistically significant (p < 0.05). This study shows that a careful inclusion of potential confounding variables is important when assessing mediation.

Propensity score methods, which are commonly used in the pharmacoepidemiology literature, can effectively control for baseline confounding by balancing measured baseline confounders and risk factors and creating comparable populations of treated and untreated patients. Methods: We propose the following 5-step checklist to guide the use and evaluation of propensity score methods: (1) select covariates, (2) assess "Table 1" balance in risk factors before propensity score implementation, (3) estimate and implement the propensity score in the study cohort, (4) reassess "Table 1" balance in risk factors after propensity score implementation, and (5) critically evaluate differences between matched and unmatched patients after propensity score implementation. We then applied this checklist to an endoscopy example using a study cohort of 411 adults with newly diagnosed eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), some of whom were treated with esophageal dilation. Results: We identified 156 patients, aged 18 and older, who were treated with esophageal dilation, and 255 patients who were nondilated. We successfully matched 148 (95%) dilated patients to nondilated patients who had a propensity score within 0.1, based on patient age, sex, race, self-reported food allergy, and presence of narrowing at baseline endoscopy. Crude imbalances were observed before propensity score matching in several baseline covariates, including age, sex, and narrowing; however, propensity score matching was successful in achieving balance across all measured covariates. Conclusions: We provide an introduction to propensity score methods, including a straightforward checklist for implementing propensity score methods in nonexperimental studies of treatment effectiveness. Moreover, we demon-strate the advantage of using "Table 1" as a simple but effective diagnostic tool for evaluating the success of propensity score methods in an applied example of esophageal dilation in EoE.

The aim of many longitudinal studies is to estimate the causal effect of a time varying exposure on an outcome that requires adjusting for time varying confounding. Time varying confounding affected by previous exposure often occurs in practice, but it is usually adjusted for by using conventional analytical methods such as time dependent Cox regression, random effects models, or generalised estimating equations, which are known to provide biased effect estimates in this setting. This article explains time varying confounding affected by previous exposure and outlines three causal methods proposed to appropriately adjust for this potential bias: inverseprobability-of-treatment weighting, the parametric G formula, and G estimation.

J	Vetter, TR; Mascha, EJ				Vetter, Thomas R.; Mascha, Edward J.			Bias, Confounding, and Interaction: Lions and Tigers, and Bears, Oh My!	ANESTHESIA AND ANALGESIA			English	Article							BLOOD-PRESSURE-MEASUREMENT; PALLIATIVE CARE RESEARCH; RANDOMIZED-TRIALS; ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT; MEDIATION ANALYSIS; PROPENSITY-SCORE; SELECTION BIAS; CLINICAL-TRIALS; MATCHED-COHORT; TOTAL HIP	Epidemiologists seek to make a valid inference about the causal effect between an exposure and a disease in a specific population, using representative sample data from a specific population. Clinical researchers likewise seek to make a valid inference about the association between an intervention and outcome(s) in a specific population, based upon their randomly collected, representative sample data. Both do so by using the available data about the sample variable to make a valid estimate about its corresponding or underlying, but unknown population parameter. Random error in an experiment can be due to the natural, periodic fluctuation or variation in the accuracy or precision of virtually any data sampling technique or health measurement tool or scale. In a clinical research study, random error can be due to not only innate human variability but also purely chance. Systematic error in an experiment arises from an innate flaw in the data sampling technique or measurement instrument. In the clinical research setting, systematic error is more commonly referred to as systematic bias. The most commonly encountered types of bias in anesthesia, perioperative, critical care, and pain medicine research include recall bias, observational bias (Hawthorne effect), attrition bias, misclassification or informational bias, and selection bias. A confounding variable is a factor associated with both the exposure of interest and the outcome of interest. A confounding variable (confounding factor or confounder) is a variable that correlates (positively or negatively) with both the exposure and outcome. Confounding is typically not an issue in a randomized trial because the randomized groups are sufficiently balanced on all potential confounding variables, both observed and nonobserved. However, confounding can be a major problem with any observational (nonrandomized) study. Ignoring confounding in an observational study will often result in a "distorted" or incorrect estimate of the association or treatment effect. Interaction among variables, also known as effect modification, exists when the effect of 1 explanatory variable on the outcome depends on the particular level or value of another explanatory variable. Bias and confounding are common potential explanations for statistically significant associations between exposure and outcome when the true relationship is noncausal. Understanding interactions is vital to proper interpretation of treatment effects. These complex concepts should be consistently and appropriately considered whenever one is not only designing but also analyzing and interpreting data from a randomized trial or observational study.

Until recently, Slater was one of the few communication scientists to suggest that media effects scholars engage in overcontrol. Bushman and Anderson have now echoed this concern in the context of a broader treatise on research trends in the media violence literature. The present study responded to Wright's recent discussion of control variable usage in the pornography literature. Specifically, using a national probability sample of approximately 1,900 U.S. adults, the present study assessed whether multiple demographic variables routinely modeled as controls in the pornography effects literature may be better conceptualized as initiating predictors. Results were inconsistent with the confounding approach but consistent with the hypothesis that individual differences predict cognitive response states that increase or decrease the likelihood of media effects.

Multivariable models allow adjustment for known and readily measurable prognostic factors, but they may incompletely or inaccurately represent the underlying overall perceived risk of treatment. To incorporate practitioners' judgments about treatment indication and preprocedural prognosis into an observational study of cerebral aneurysm treatments, the author and colleagues presented patient characteristics and radiographic images from 179 aneurysm cases (University of California, San Francisco, 1990-1997) to panels of practitioners who were blinded as to actual treatment selection and outcome. In this way, the review process was designed to recreate the presentation of information in a prospective study. Judgments about inclusion and prognosis were reproducible. Perceived prognosis correlated with complication rates and provided information not present in a multivariable model including all available clinical characteristics. The association between treatment modality and outcome was examined while stratifying and adjusting for differences in perceived prognosis. Blinded prospective review may provide an unbiased observational study design with which to define a cohort that could have received any of the treatments being compared and to measure and adjust for overall perceived procedural risk.

OBJECTIVE: We aim to provide a conceptualization of SES and a review of approaches to its measurement in the U.S. context and discuss pathways by which SES may influence health and confound effects of air pollution. We explore bias related to measurement and operationalization and identify statistical approaches to reduce bias and confounding. DISCUSSION: Drawing on the social epidemiology, health geography, and economic literatures, we describe how SES, a multifaceted construct operating through myriad pathways, may be conceptualized and operationalized in air pollution epidemiology studies. SES varies across individuals within the contexts of place, time, and culture. Although no single variable or index can fully capture SES, many studies rely on only a single measure. We recommend examining multiple facets of SES appropriate to the study design. Furthermore, investigators should carefully consider the multiple mechanisms by which SES might be operating to identify those SES indicators that may be most appropriate for a given context or study design and assess the impact of improper adjustment on air pollution effect estimates. Last, exploring model contraction and expansion methods may enrich adjustment, whereas statistical approaches, such as quantitative bias analysis, may be used to evaluate residual confounding.

Using examples from large health care database studies, this article provides the clinicians with an overview of standard methods in the analysis phase, such as stratification, standardization, multivariable regression analysis and propensity score (PS) methods, together with the more advanced high-dimensional propensity score (HD-PS) method. We describe the progression from simple stratification confined to the inclusion of a few potential confounders to complex modeling procedures such as the HD-PS approach by which hundreds of potential confounders are extracted from large health care databases. Stratification and standardization assist in the understanding of the data at a detailed level, while accounting for potential confounders. Incorporating several potential confounders in the analysis typically implies the choice between multivariable analysis and PS methods. Although PS methods have gained remarkable popularity in recent years, there is an ongoing discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of PS methods as compared to those of multivariable analysis. Furthermore, the HD-PS method, despite its generous inclusion of potential confounders, is also associated with potential pitfalls. All methods are dependent on the assumption of no unknown, unmeasured and residual confounding and suffer from the difficulty of identifying true confounders. Even in large health care databases, insufficient or poor data may contribute to these challenges. The trend in data collection is to compile more fine-grained data on lifestyle and severity of diseases, based on self-reporting and modern technologies. This will surely improve our ability to incorporate relevant confounders or their proxies. However, despite a remarkable development of methods that account for confounding and new data opportunities, confounding will remain a serious issue. Considering the advantages and disadvantages of different methods, we emphasize the importance of the clinical input and of the interplay between clinicians and analysts to ensure a proper analysis.

From bad to worse: collider stratification amplifies confounding bias in the "obesity paradox"	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Obesity paradox; Confounding bias; Selection bias	MORTALITY; SMOKING	Smoking is often identified as a confounder of the obesity-mortality relationship. Selection bias can amplify the magnitude of an existing confounding bias. The objective of the present report is to demonstrate how confounding bias due to cigarette smoking is increased in the presence of collider stratification bias using an empirical example and directed acyclic graphs. The empirical example uses data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, a prospective cohort study of 15,792 men and women in the United States. Poisson regression models were used to examine the confounding effect of smoking. In the total ARIC study population, smoking produced a confounding bias of < 3 percentage points. This result was obtained by comparing the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for obesity from a model adjusted for smoking was 1.07 (95 % CI 1.00, 1.15) with one that did not adjust for smoking was 1.10 (95 % CI 1.03, 1.18). However, among smokers with CVD, the obesity IRR was 0.89 (95 % CI 0.81, 0.99), while among non-smokers with CVD the obesity IRR was 1.20 (95 % CI 1.03, 1.41). The empirical and graphical explanations presented suggest that the magnitude of the confounding bias induced by smoking is greater in the presence of collider stratification bias.

J	Kaufman, S; Kaufman, JS; MacLehose, RF; Greenland, S; Poole, C				Kaufman, S; Kaufman, JS; MacLehose, RF; Greenland, S; Poole, C			Improved estimation of controlled direct effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding of intermediate variables	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						effect decomposition; causality; confounding; counterfactual models; bias		Adjusting for a causal intermediate is a common analytic strategy for estimating an average causal direct effect (ACDE). The ACDE is the component of the total exposure effect that is not relayed through the specified intermediate. Even if the total effect is unconfounded, the usual ACDE estimate may be biased when an unmeasured variable affects the intermediate and outcome variables. Using linear programming optimization to compute non-parametric bounds, we develop new ACDE estimators for binary measured variables in this causal structure, and use root mean square confounding bias (RMSB) to compare their performance with the usual stratified estimator in simulated distributions of target populations comprised of the 64 possible potential response types as well as distributions of target populations restricted to subsets of 18 or 12 potential response types defined by monotonicity or no-interactions assumptions of unit-level causal effects. We also consider target population distributions conditioned on fixed outcome risk among the unexposed, or fixed true ACDE in one stratum of the intermediate. Results show that a midpoint estimator constructed from the optimization bounds has consistently lower RMSB than the usual stratified estimator both unconditionally and conditioned on any risk in the unexposed. When conditioning on true ACDE, this midpoint estimator perfouns more poorly only when conditioned on an extreme true ACDE in one stratum of the intermediate, yet outperforms the stratified estimator in the other stratum when interaction is permitted. An alternate 'limit-modified crude' estimator can never perform less favourably than the stratified estimator, and often has lower RMSB. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We assessed the association, accounting for selective dropout due to death or dementia, and, in a subsample, accounting for confounding by early-life intelligence. Data from the Danish component of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (n = 3,400) were linked to registry data (education records, dementia diagnoses, and mortality) and the Danish Conscription Database (youth intelligence measurements for 854 men). Word recall and verbal fluency were assessed up to 4 times over 10 years (2004-2013) and combined by averaging the z scores. We fitted a joint model linking a time-to-event model for dementia or death to a linear mixed-effects model for cognitive change. Rate of cognitive decline was slower among people with high education compared with low education (beta = 0.112, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.056,0.170). Adjusting for youth intelligence did not attenuate the association between education and cognitive decline (crude beta = 0.136,95% CI: 0.028,0.244 vs. adjusted beta = 0.145,95% CI: 0.022,0.269). The results suggest that higher education may slow cognitive decline in later life. In this sample, results changed little when accounting for selective attrition and confounding by intelligence.

Sharp sensitivity bounds for mediation under unmeasured mediator-outcome confounding	BIOMETRIKA			English	Article						Bounding factor; Causal inference; Collider; Natural direct effect; Natural indirect effect	NATURAL DIRECT; LUNG-CANCER; IDENTIFICATION; SMOKING; MODELS	It is often of interest to decompose the total effect of an exposure into a component that acts on the outcome through some mediator and a component that acts independently through other pathways. Said another way, we are interested in the direct and indirect effects of the exposure on the outcome. Even if the exposure is randomly assigned, it is often infeasible to randomize the mediator, leaving the mediator-outcome confounding not fully controlled. We develop a sensitivity analysis technique that can bound the direct and indirect effects without parametric assumptions about the unmeasured mediator-outcome confounding.

Identifying and Addressing Confounding Bias in Violence Prevention Research	CURRENT EPIDEMIOLOGY REPORTS			English	Article						Confounding; Directed acyclic graphs; Violence prevention	FIREARM LEGISLATION; SUBSTANCE USE; RISK; GUN; PERPETRATION; ASSOCIATION; YOUTH; AMERICAN; HOMICIDE; SUICIDE	Purpose of ReviewViolence prevention research has enhanced our understanding of individual and community risk and protective factors for aggression and violence. However, our knowledge of risk and protective factors for violence is highly dependent on observational studies, since there are few randomized trials of risk and protective factors for violence. Observational studies are susceptible to systematic errors, specifically confounding, and may lack internal validity.Recent FindingsMany violence prevention studies utilize methods that do not correctly identify the set of covariates needed for statistical adjustment. This results in unwarranted matching and restriction leading to further confounding or selection bias. Covariate adjustment based on purely statistical criteria generates inconsistent results and uncertain conclusions.SummaryConventional methods used to identify confounding in violence prevention research are often inadequate. Causal diagrams have the potential to improve the understanding and identification of potential confounding biases in observational violence prevention studies, and methods like sensitivity analysis using quantitative bias analysis can help to address unmeasured confounding. Violence research studies should make more use of these methods.

Standardization typically reweights the stratum-specific rates so that exposure categories become comparable. With the development first of loglinear models, soon also of nonlinear regression techniques (logistic regression, failure time regression) that the emerging computers could handle, regression modelling became the preferred approach, just as was already the case with multiple regression analysis for continuous outcomes. Since the mid 1990s it has become increasingly obvious that weighting methods are still often useful, sometimes even necessary. On this background we aim at describing the emergence of the modelling approach and the refinement of the weighting approach for confounder control.

Methods: The quality of included articles was assessed according to Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale and the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology. A random effects model was used to calculate pooled risk ratios and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), and publication bias was tested by Egger statistical test. Results: Eight studies were included finally. We found a crude positive association of prenatal antibiotics use during each pregnancy trimester and risk of childhood asthma or wheeze with RRs of 1.28 (95% CI, 1.09-1.51) for the first trimester of pregnancy, 1.25 (95% CI, 1.02-1.52) for the second trimester, and 1.25 (95% Cl, 1.05-1.49) for the third trimester. However, when considering potential factors of maternal infections and presence of siblings, the relationship for each trimester was insignificant. Conclusions: This systemic review and meta-analysis proposed a crude positive association between prenatal antibiotic use in every specific trimester and risk of childhood asthma or wheeze. However, adjustment for confounders decreased the relative risk estimates, supporting the concept that these associations are, at least in part, because of confounding by indication.

Further, previous studies have not accounted for possible time-dependent confounding of the association between MBD markers and death due to the effect of markers of MBD on treatments, which subsequently may affect MBD markers. Study Design: Multicenter, 3-year, prospective, case-cohort study. Setting & Participants: 8,229 hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (parathyroid hormone level <= 180 pg/mL and/or receiving vitamin D receptor activators) at 86 facilities in Japan. Predictors: Serum phosphorus, calcium, and parathyroid hormone levels. Outcome: All-cause mortality. Measurements: Marginal structural models were used to compute absolute differences in all-cause mortality associated with different levels of predictors while accounting for time-dependent confounding. Results: The association between phosphorus level and mortality appeared U-shaped, although only higher phosphorus level categories reached statistical significance: compared to those with phosphorus levels of 5.0-5.9 mg/dL (1.61-1.93 mmol/L), patients with the highest (>= 9.0 mg/dL [>= 2.90 mmol/L]) phosphorus levels had 9.4 excess deaths/100 person-years (rate ratio, 2.79 [95% CI, 1.26-6.15]), whereas no association was found for the lowest phosphorus category (< 3.0 mg/dL [< 0.97 mmol/L]; rate ratio, 1.54 [95% CI, 0.87-2.71]). Similarly, hypercalcemia (>= 10.0 mg/dL [>= 2.50 mmol/L]) was associated with excess deaths, and the highest level of hypercalcemia (>= 11.0 mg/dL [>= 2.75 mmol/L]) was associated with 5.8 excess deaths/100 person-years ( rate ratio, 2.38 [ 95% CI, 1.77-3.21]) compared to those with levels of 9.0-9.4 mg/dL (2.25-2.37 mmol/L). Abnormally high parathyroid hormone levels were not associated with excess deaths. Limitations: Possible residual confounding. Conclusions: These results reinforce the idea that serum calcium (in addition to phosphorus) level is an important predictor of the absolute risk of death in hemodialysis patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Selecting a scale for spatial confounding adjustment	JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY SERIES A-STATISTICS IN SOCIETY			English	Article						Air pollution epidemiology; Confounding; Regression splines; Spatial filtering	AIR-POLLUTION; TIME-SERIES; PARTICULATE MATTER; REGRESSION; MORTALITY; MODEL; BIAS; DIMENSION; EXPOSURE; HEALTH	Unmeasured, spatially structured factors can confound associations between spatial environmental exposures and health outcomes. Adding flexible splines to a regression model is a simple approach for spatial confounding adjustment, but the spline degrees of freedom do not provide an easily interpretable spatial scale. We describe a method for quantifying the extent of spatial confounding adjustment in terms of the Euclidean distance at which variation is removed. We develop this approach for confounding adjustment with splines and using Fourier and wavelet filtering. We demonstrate differences in the spatial scales that these bases can represent and provide a comparison of methods for selecting the amount of confounding adjustment. We find the best performance for selecting the amount of adjustment by using an information criterion evaluated on an outcome model without exposure. We apply this method to spatial adjustment in an analysis of fine particulate matter and blood pressure in a cohort of US women.

Methods: Using five waves of the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (2013-2019), we estimated marginal structural models with inverse probability of treatment and censoring weights to examine the association between time-varying e-cigarette initiation and subsequent cigarette smoking initiation among e-cigarette- and cigarette-naive youth (12-17 years) at baseline. Time-dependent confounders used as predictors in inverse probability weights included tobacco-related attitudes or beliefs, mental health symptoms, substance use, and tobacco-marketing exposure. Results: Among 9,584 youth at baseline, those who initiated e-cigarettes were 2.4 times as likely to subsequently initiate cigarette smoking as youth who did not initiate e-cigarettes (risk ratio - 2.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.1, 2.7), after accounting for timedependent confounding and selection bias. Among youth who initiated e-cigarettes, more frequent vaping was associated with greater risk of smoking initiation (risk ratio >= 3 days/month - 1.8, 95% CI = 1.4, 2.2; 1-2 days/month = 1.2; 95% CI = 0.93, 1.6 vs. 0 days/month). Weighted marginal structural model estimates were moderately attenuated compared with unweighted estimates adjusted for baseline-only confounders. At the US population level, we estimated over half a million youth initiated cigarette smoking because of prior e-cigarette use over follow-up. Conclusions: The association between youth vaping and combustible cigarette smoking persisted after accounting for time-dependent confounding. We estimate that e-cigarette use accounts for a considerable share of cigarette initiation among US youth. See video abstract at, http://links.lww.com/EDE/B937.

Noncollapsibility and its role in quantifying confounding bias in logistic regression	BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY			English	Article						Logistic regression; Confounding; Noncollapsibility; Confounder-adjustment; Univariable regression analysis; Multivariable regression analysis; Inverse probability weighting; Conditional effect; Marginal effect	PROPENSITY SCORE METHODS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; COLLAPSIBILITY; LOGIT; PROBIT; MODELS	BackgroundConfounding bias is a common concern in epidemiological research. Its presence is often determined by comparing exposure effects between univariable- and multivariable regression models, using an arbitrary threshold of a 10% difference to indicate confounding bias. However, many clinical researchers are not aware that the use of this change-in-estimate criterion may lead to wrong conclusions when applied to logistic regression coefficients. This is due to a statistical phenomenon called noncollapsibility, which manifests itself in logistic regression models. This paper aims to clarify the role of noncollapsibility in logistic regression and to provide guidance in determining the presence of confounding bias.MethodsA Monte Carlo simulation study was designed to uncover patterns of confounding bias and noncollapsibility effects in logistic regression. An empirical data example was used to illustrate the inability of the change-in-estimate criterion to distinguish confounding bias from noncollapsibility effects.ResultsThe simulation study showed that, depending on the sign and magnitude of the confounding bias and the noncollapsibility effect, the difference between the effect estimates from univariable- and multivariable regression models may underestimate or overestimate the magnitude of the confounding bias. Because of the noncollapsibility effect, multivariable regression analysis and inverse probability weighting provided different but valid estimates of the confounder-adjusted exposure effect. In our data example, confounding bias was underestimated by the change in estimate due to the presence of a noncollapsibility effect.ConclusionIn logistic regression, the difference between the univariable- and multivariable effect estimate might not only reflect confounding bias but also a noncollapsibility effect. Ideally, the set of confounders is determined at the study design phase and based on subject matter knowledge. To quantify confounding bias, one could compare the unadjusted exposure effect estimate and the estimate from an inverse probability weighted model.	[Schuster, Noah A.; Twisk, Jos W.

Summary statistic analyses can mistake confounding bias for heritability	GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						GWAS; heritability estimation; misspecified models	GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; LD SCORE REGRESSION; LINEAR MIXED-MODEL; GENETIC CORRELATION; SNP HERITABILITY; COMPLEX TRAITS; VARIANTS; ARCHITECTURE; LOCI	Linkage disequilibrium SCore regression (LDSC) has become a popular approach to estimate confounding bias, heritability, and genetic correlation using only genome-wide association study (GWAS) test statistics. SumHer is a newly introduced alternative with similar aims. We show using theory and simulations that both approaches fail to adequately account for confounding bias, even when the assumed heritability model is correct. Consequently, these methods may estimate heritability poorly if there was an inadequate adjustment for confounding in the original GWAS analysis. We also show that the choice of a summary statistic for use in LDSC or SumHer can have a large impact on resulting inferences. Further, covariate adjustments in the original GWAS can alter the target of heritability estimation, which can be problematic for test statistics from a meta-analysis of GWAS with different covariate adjustments.

Interpreting population- and family-based genome-wide association studies in the presence of confounding	PLOS BIOLOGY			English	Article							GENOTYPE-PHENOTYPE ASSOCIATIONS; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; STRATIFICATION; HERITABILITY; ADMIXTURE; SELECTION; HISTORY; MODEL; RISK	A central aim of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) is to estimate direct genetic effects: the causal effects on an individual's phenotype of the alleles that they carry. However, estimates of direct effects can be subject to genetic and environmental confounding and can also absorb the "indirect" genetic effects of relatives' genotypes. Recently, an important development in controlling for these confounds has been the use of within-family GWASs, which, because of the randomness of mendelian segregation within pedigrees, are often interpreted as producing unbiased estimates of direct effects. Here, we present a general theoretical analysis of the influence of confounding in standard population-based and within-family GWASs. We show that, contrary to common interpretation, family-based estimates of direct effects can be biased by genetic confounding. In humans, such biases will often be small per-locus, but can be compounded when effect-size estimates are used in polygenic scores (PGSs). We illustrate the influence of genetic confounding on population- and family-based estimates of direct effects using models of assortative mating, population stratification, and stabilizing selection on GWAS traits. We further show how family-based estimates of indirect genetic effects, based on comparisons of parentally transmitted and untransmitted alleles, can suffer substantial genetic confounding. We conclude that, while family-based studies have placed GWAS estimation on a more rigorous footing, they carry subtle issues of interpretation that arise from confounding. GWASs aim to estimate direct effects of genotype on an individual's phenotype, but this can be subject to genetic and environmental confounds and "indirect" genetic effects of relatives' genotypes. This study presents a theoretical analysis of the influence of confounders in population-based and within-family GWASs, showing that, while family-based studies are more rigorous, they still carry subtle issues that arise from confounding.

J	Marques, I; Kneib, T; Klein, N				Marques, Isa; Kneib, Thomas; Klein, Nadja			Mitigating spatial confounding by explicitly correlating Gaussian random fields	ENVIRONMETRICS			English	Article						Bayesian inference; penalized complexity prior; spatial statistics; stochastic partial differential equation	MARKOV RANDOM-FIELDS; MODELS	Spatial models are used in a variety of research areas, such as environmental sciences, epidemiology, or physics. A common phenomenon in such spatial regression models is spatial confounding. This phenomenon is observed when spatially indexed covariates modeling the mean of the response are correlated with a spatial random effect included in the model, for example, as a proxy of unobserved spatial confounders. As a result, estimates for regression coefficients of the covariates can be severely biased and interpretation of these is no longer valid. Recent literature has shown that typical solutions for reducing spatial confounding can lead to misleading and counterintuitive results. In this article, we develop a computationally efficient spatial model that explicitly correlates a Gaussian random field for the covariate of interest with the Gaussian random field in the main model equation and integrates novel prior structures to reduce spatial confounding. Starting from the univariate case, we extend our prior structure also to the case of multiple spatially confounded covariates. In simulation studies, we show that our novel model flexibly detects and reduces spatial confounding in spatial datasets, and it performs better than typically used methods such as restricted spatial regression. These results are promising for any applied researcher who wishes to interpret covariate effects in spatial regression models. As a real data illustration, we study the effect of elevation and temperature on the mean of monthly precipitation in Germany.

Challenging the utility of polygenic scores for social science: Environmental confounding, downward causation, and unknown biology	BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Editorial Material						behavior genetics; environmental confounding; gene-environment correlation; genetic heterogeneity; GWAS; human potential; polygenic scores; population stratification; sociogenomics; statistical genetics	HERITABILITY	The sociogenomics revolution is upon us, we are told. Whether revolutionary or not, sociogenomics is poised to flourish given the ease of incorporating polygenic scores (or PGSs) as "genetic propensities" for complex traits into social science research. Pointing to evidence of ubiquitous heritability and the accessibility of genetic data, scholars have argued that social scientists not only have an opportunity but a duty to add PGSs to social science research. Social science research that ignores genetics is, some proponents argue, at best partial and likely scientifically flawed, misleading, and wasteful. Here, I challenge arguments about the value of genetics for social science and with it the claimed necessity of incorporating PGSs into social science models as measures of genetic influences. In so doing, I discuss the impracticability of distinguishing genetic influences from environmental influences because of non-causal gene-environment correlations, especially population stratification, familial confounding, and downward causation. I explain how environmental effects masquerade as genetic influences in PGSs, which undermines their raison d'etre as measures of genetic propensity, especially for complex socially contingent behaviors that are the subject of sociogenomics. Additionally, I draw attention to the partial, unknown biology, while highlighting the persistence of an implicit, unavoidable reductionist genes versus environments approach. Leaving sociopolitical and ethical concerns aside, I argue that the potential scientific rewards of adding PGSs to social science are few and greatly overstated and the scientific costs, which include obscuring structural disadvantages and cultural influences, outweigh these meager benefits for most social science applications.

J	Bender, R; Blettner, M				Bender, R; Blettner, M			Calculating the "number needed to be exposed" with adjustment for confounding variables in epidemiological studies	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						confounding; confidence intervals; epidemiology; logistic regression; number needed to treat; odds ratio; statistics	LOGISTIC-REGRESSION MODELS; ABSOLUTE RISK REDUCTION; CONFIDENCE-INTERVALS; TREAT; STATISTICS; TRIALS	The number needed to treat (NNT) is a popular summary statistic to describe the absolute effect of a new treatment compared with a standard treatment or control concerning the risk of an adverse event. The NNT concept can be applied whenever the risk of an adverse event is compared between two groups; for the comparison of exposed with unexposed subjects in epidemiological studies, we propose the term "number needed to be exposed" (NINE). Whereas in randomized clinical trials NNT can be calculated on the basis of a simple 2x2 table, in epidemiological studies methods to adjust for confounders are required in most applications. We derive a method based upon multiple logistic regression analysis to pet-form point and interval estimation of NNE with adjustment for confounding variables. The adjusted NNE can be calculated from the adjusted odds ratio (OR) and the unexposed event rate (UER) estimated by means of an appropriate multiple logistic regression model. As UER is dependent on the confounders, the adjusted NNEs also vary with the values of the confounding variables. Two methods are proposed to take the dependence of NNE on the values of the confounders into account. The adjusted number needed to be exposed can be a useful complement to the commonly presented results in epidemiological studies, such as ORs and attributable risks. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

Addressing geographic confounding through spatial propensity scores: a study of racial disparities in diabetes	STATISTICAL METHODS IN MEDICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Diabetes control; doubly robust estimator; geographic confounding; health disparities; propensity scores; spatial data analysis	US POPULATION; CAUSAL INFERENCE; STROKE MORTALITY; NATIONAL-HEALTH; UNITED-STATES; REGRESSION; ADULTS; AMERICANS; TUTORIAL; MODELS	Motivated by a study exploring differences in glycemic control between non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white veterans with type 2 diabetes, we aim to address a type of confounding that arises in spatially referenced observational studies. Specifically, we develop a spatial doubly robust propensity score estimator to reduce bias associated with geographic confounding, which occurs when measured or unmeasured confounding factors vary by geographic location, leading to imbalanced group comparisons. We augment the doubly robust estimator with spatial random effects, which are assigned conditionally autoregressive priors to improve inferences by borrowing information across neighboring geographic regions. Through a series of simulations, we show that ignoring spatial variation results in increased absolute bias and mean squared error, while the spatial doubly robust estimator performs well under various levels of spatial heterogeneity and moderate sample sizes. In the motivating application, we construct three global estimates of the risk difference between race groups: an unadjusted estimate, a doubly robust estimate that adjusts only for patient-level information, and a hierarchical spatial doubly robust estimate. Results indicate a gradual reduction in the risk difference at each stage, with the inclusion of spatial random effects providing a 20% reduction compared to an estimate that ignores spatial heterogeneity. Smoothed maps indicate poor glycemic control across Alabama and southern Georgia, areas comprising the so-called "stroke belt." These results suggest the need for community-specific interventions to target diabetes in geographic areas of greatest need.

Objective: To determine the extent to which the association between SDP and offspring substance use/problems depends on confounded familial background factors by using a quasi-experimental design. Design: We used 2 separate samples from the United States and Sweden. The analyses prospectively predicted multiple indices of substance use and problems while controlling for statistical covariates and comparing differentially exposed siblings to minimize confounding. Setting: Offspring of a representative sample of women in the United States (sample 1) and the total Swedish population born during the period from January 1, 1983, to December 31, 1995 (sample 2). Patients or Other Participants: Adolescent offspring of the women in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (n=6904) and all offspring born in Sweden during the 13-year period (n=1187360). Main Outcome Measures: Self-reported adolescent alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use and early onset (before 14 years of age) of each substance (sample 1) and substance-related convictions and hospitalizations for an alcohol-or other drug-related problem (sample 2). Results: The same pattern emerged for each index of substance use/problems across the 2 samples. At the population level, maternal SDP predicted every measure of offspring substance use/problems in both samples, ranging from adolescent alcohol use (hazard ratio [HR](moderate), 1.32 [95% CI, 1.22-1.43]; HRhigh, 1.33 [1.17-1.53]) to a narcotics-related conviction (HRmoderate, 2.23 [2.14-2.31]; HRhigh, 2.97 [2.86-3.09]). When comparing differentially exposed siblings to minimize genetic and environmental confounds, however, the association between SDP and each measure of substance use/problems was minimal and not statistically significant. Conclusions: The association between maternal SDP and offspring substance use/problems is likely due to familial background factors, not a causal influence, because siblings have similar rates of substance use and problems regardless of their specific exposure to SDP.

Analyses were conducted in 2687 participants of a German, population-based cohort of older adults with data collection 2008-2010. Polypharmacy was defined as >= 5 drugs and hyperpolypharmacy as >= 10 drugs. Drugs without relevant propensity of causing adverse drug reactions or drug-drug interactions were not counted. Confounding by indication was addressed by model adjustment for a propensity score for polypharmacy. The median age of study participants was 70 years, 10.7% had multi-morbidity, and 47.4% took five drugs or more (8.6% took >= 10 drugs). During 4.4 years of follow-up, 87 participants died of a cause other than cancer. Statistically significant, more than twofold increased non-cancer mortality was observed for subjects with polypharmacy or hyperpolypharmacy in a model adjusted for age, sex, education, lifestyle variables, and comorbidity, but associations lost statistical significance after additional adjustment for a propensity score for polypharmacy. However, a significant interaction of hyperpolypharmacy and multi-morbidity was detected (p = 0.019). The hazard ratio for the association of hyperpolypharmacy with non-cancer mortality was 1.42 (95%CI 0.57; 3.57) in subjects without multi-morbidity and 0.51 (95%CI 0.11; 2.27) in subjects with multi-morbidity. Polypharmacy was not independently associated with non-cancer mortality. This study highlights the importance to adjust for confounding by indication in studies on polypharmacy by a propensity score. The detected interaction suggests that hyperpolypharmacy can be indicated in subjects with multi-morbidity and may only be harmful in subjects without multi-morbidity.

Challenging the utility of polygenic scores for social science: Environmental confounding, downward causation, and unknown biology	BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN SCIENCES			English	Article						behavior genetics; environmental confounding; gene-environment correlation; genetic heterogeneity; GWAS; human potential; polygenic scores; population stratification; sociogenomics; statistical genetics	GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; SCALE GENETIC-STRUCTURE; STRUCTURAL VARIATION; MISSING HERITABILITY; POPULATION-STRUCTURE; PREDICTION; RISK; RARE; STRATIFICATION; EXPLANATION	The sociogenomics revolution is upon us, we are told. Whether revolutionary or not, sociogenomics is poised to flourish given the ease of incorporating polygenic scores (or PGSs) as "genetic propensities" for complex traits into social science research. Pointing to evidence of ubiquitous heritability and the accessibility of genetic data, scholars have argued that social scientists not only have an opportunity but a duty to add PGSs to social science research. Social science research that ignores genetics is, some proponents argue, at best partial and likely scientifically flawed, misleading, and wasteful. Here, I challenge arguments about the value of genetics for social science and with it the claimed necessity of incorporating PGSs into social science models as measures of genetic influences. In so doing, I discuss the impracticability of distinguishing genetic influences from environmental influences because of non-causal gene-environment correlations, especially population stratification, familial confounding, and downward causation. I explain how environmental effects masquerade as genetic influences in PGSs, which undermines their raison d'etre as measures of genetic propensity, especially for complex socially contingent behaviors that are the subject of sociogenomics. Additionally, I draw attention to the partial, unknown biology, while highlighting the persistence of an implicit, unavoidable reductionist genes versus environments approach. Leaving sociopolitical and ethical concerns aside, I argue that the potential scientific rewards of adding PGSs to social science are few and greatly overstated and the scientific costs, which include obscuring structural disadvantages and cultural influences, outweigh these meager benefits for most social science applications.

The influence of cluster-constant confounders can be eliminated by studying the exposure-outcome association within (conditional on) clusters, but additional regression modeling is usually required to control for observed cluster-varying confounders. A problem is that the working regression model may be misspecified, in which case the estimated within-cluster association may be biased. To reduce sensitivity to model misspecification we propose to augment the standard working model for the outcome with an auxiliary working model for the exposure. We derive a doubly robust conditional generalized estimating equation (DRCGEE) estimator for the within-cluster association. This estimator combines the two models in such a way that it is consistent if either model is correct, not necessarily both. Thus, the DRCGEE estimator gives the researcher two chances instead of only one to make valid inference on the within-cluster association. We have implemented the estimator in an R package and we use it to examine the association between smoking during pregnancy and cognitive abilities in offspring, in a sample of siblings.

The issues are illustrated in a sensitivity analysis of confounding in a study of residential wire code and childhood leukemia and in a pooled analysis of 12 studies of magnetic-field measurements and childhood leukemia. Both analyses have been interpreted as evidence in favor of a causal effect of magnetic fields on leukemia risk. This interpretation is contrasted with results from analyses based on prior distributions for the unidentified bias parameters used in the original sensitivity-analysis model. These analyses indicate that accounting for uncontrolled confounding and response bias under a reasonable prior can substantially alter inferences about the existence of a magnetic-field effect. More generally, analyses with informative priors for unidentified bias parameters can help avoid misinterpretation of conventional results and ordinary sensitivity analyses.

Meta-analysis of lung cancer in asphalt roofing and paving workers with external adjustment for confounding by coal tar	JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HYGIENE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Health Effects of Occupational Exposure to Emissions from Asphalt/Bitumen Symposium	JUN 07-08, 2006	BG Acad Occupat Hlth & Safety, Dresden, GERMANY	ACGIH, Commiss Invest Hlth Hazards Chem Compounds Work Area, DFG	BG Acad Occupat Hlth & Safety	meta-analysis; confounding; asphalt; coal tar; epidemiology; lung cancer	BITUMEN FUME; AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS; MORTALITY; RISK; EXPOSURE; COHORT; OCCUPATION; SMOKING; CARCINOGENICITY; ROOFERS	The study's objectives were to update Partanen's and Boffetta's 1994 meta- analysis of lung cancer among roofing and paving asphalt workers and explore the role of coal tar in explaining the statistical heterogeneity among these studies. Information retrieval strategies and eligibility criteria were defined for identifying the epidemiologic studies to be included in the analysis. The relative risk ratio ( RR) for lung cancer was selected as the effect measure of interest. Coal tar bias factors were developed and used to externally adjust each eligible study's published RR for confounding by coal tar. Confidence intervals on adjusted RRs were estimated by the Monte Carlo methods outlined by Steenland and Greenland ( 2004). The meta- Relative Risk ( meta- RR) and its variance were estimated by general variance- based methods. Heterogeneity of the RRs was assessed by heterogeneity chisquare and I-2 tests. Also explored were the influences of study design; differences between internally and externally adjusted RRs; and the potential impact of coal tar misclassification. The results from this update were similar to those in Partanen's and Boffetta's original meta- analysis. The unadjusted metaRR ( random effects model) for the roofing studies was elevated ( meta- RR= 1.67, 95% CI = 1.39 - 2.02, I-2 = 80%) and significantly greater than the meta- RR for the paving studies ( meta RR=0.98, 95% CI = 0.81 - 1.18, I-2 = 59%). After adjustment for confounding by coal tar, however, the corrected roofers' meta- RR dropped to 1.10 ( meta- RR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.91 1.33, I-2 = 60%), while the corrected pavers' meta- RR was nearly unchanged at 0.96 ( meta- RR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.80 1.16, I-2 = 56%). Although the meta- RRs for the roofers and the pavers were no longer statistically significantly different from one another, significant heterogeneity remained within each of the coal tar- adjusted sectors. Stratifying the roofing and paving studies by study design revealed that statistical heterogeneity was concentrated in the weaker designs such as those relying on death certificates for work history. When the weaker studies were excluded, the remaining roofing and paving studies had a combined meta- RR close to 1.0 ( meta- RR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.88 - 1.17) with no significant heterogeneity ( I-2 = 0%). Meta- analysis of non- experimental epidemiologic studies is subject to significant uncertainties as is externally correcting studies for confounding. Given these uncertainties, the specific quantitative estimates in this ( or any similar) analysis must be viewed with caution. Nevertheless, this analysis provides support for the hypothesis proposed by several major reviewers that confounding by coal tar- related PAH exposures may explain most or all of the lung cancer risks found in the epidemiologic literature on asphalt roofing and paving workers.

We aimed to evaluate the effect when accounting for time-dependent confounding affected by previous adherence as well as time sequence between factors. Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Finnish healthcare registers. Participants Women aged 45-64years initiating statin use for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in 2001-2004 (n=42807). Outcomes Acute cardiovascular event defined as a composite of acute coronary syndrome and acute ischaemic stroke was our primary outcome. Low-energy fractures were used as a negative control outcome to evaluate the healthy-adherer effect. Results During the 3-year follow-up, 474 women experienced the primary outcome event and 557 suffered a low-energy fracture. The causal HR estimated with marginal structural model for acute cardiovascular events for all the women who remained adherent (proportion of days covered 80%) to statin therapy during the previous adherence assessment year was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.65 to 0.94) when compared with everybody remaining non-adherent (proportion of days covered <80%). The result was robust against alternative model specifications. Statin adherers had a potentially reduced risk of experiencing low-energy fractures compared with non-adherers (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.07). Conclusions Our study, which took into account the time dependence of adherence and confounders, as well as temporal order between these factors, is support for the concept that adherence to statins in women in primary prevention decreases the risk of acute cardiovascular events by about one-fifth in comparison to non-adherence. However, part of the observed effect of statin adherence on acute cardiovascular events may be due to the healthy-adherer effect.

Approaches to addressing missing values, measurement error, and confounding in epidemiologic studies	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Data analysis; Confounding; Measurement error; Missing data; Simulation; Regression calibration; Imputation; Regression	MULTIPLE-IMPUTATION; CAUSAL INFERENCE; BIG DATA	Objectives: Epidemiologic studies often suffer from incomplete data, measurement error (or misclassification), and confounding. Each of these can cause bias and imprecision in estimates of exposure-outcome relations. We describe and compare statistical approaches that aim to control all three sources of bias simultaneously. Study Design and Setting: We illustrate four statistical approaches that address all three sources of bias, namely, multiple imputation for missing data and measurement error, multiple imputation combined with regression calibration, full information maximum likelihood within a structural equation modeling framework, and a Bayesian model. In a simulation study, we assess the performance of the four approaches compared with more commonly used approaches that do not account for measurement error, missing values, or confounding. Results: The results demonstrate that the four approaches consistently outperform the alternative approaches on all performance metrics (bias, mean squared error, and confidence interval coverage). Even in simulated data of 100 subjects, these approaches perform well. Conclusion: There can be a large benefit of addressing measurement error, missing values, and confounding to improve the estimation of exposure-outcome relations, even when the available sample size is relatively small.

Purpose We address a bias that arises from adaptive randomization in the setting of a time trend in disease incidence. Methods We use a potential-outcome model and directed acyclic graphs to illustrate the bias that arises from a changing subject allocation ratio with a concurrent change in background risk. Results In a trial that uses adaptive randomization, time trends in risk can bias the crude effect estimate obtained by naively combining the data from the different stages of the trial. We illustrate how the bias arises from an interplay of departures from exchangeability among groups and the changing randomization proportions. Limitations We focus on risk-ratio and risk-difference analysis. Conclusions Analysis of trials using adaptive randomization should involve attention to or adjustment for possible trends in background risk. Numerous modeling strategies are available for that purpose, including stratification, trend modeling, inverse-probability-of-treatment weighting, and hierarchical regression.

Applying multiple regression models including the effects of treatment and covariates on outcome is the well-known classical approach to adjust for confounding. In recent years other approaches have been promoted. One of them is based on the propensity score and considers the effect of possible confounders on treatment as a relevant criterion for adjustment. Another proposal is based on using an instrumental variable. Here inference relies on a factor, the instrument, which affects treatment but is thought to be otherwise unrelated to outcome, so that it mimics randomization. Each of these approaches can basically be interpreted as a simple reweighting scheme, designed to address confounding. The procedures will be compared with respect to their fundamental properties, namely, which bias they aim to eliminate, which effect they aim to estimate, and which parameter is modelled. We will expand our overview of methods for analysis of non-randomized studies to methods for analysis of randomized controlled trials and show that analyses of both study types may target different effects and different parameters. The considerations will be illustrated using a breast cancer study with a so-called Comprehensive Cohort Study design, including a randomized controlled trial and a non-randomized study in the same patient population as sub-cohorts. This design offers ideal opportunities to discuss and illustrate the properties of the different approaches.

We propose a two-stage approach for estimating the degree to which such observed associations can be explained by genetic confounding. First, we assess attenuation of exposure effects in regressions controlling for increasingly powerful polygenic scores. Second, we use structural equation models to estimate genetic confounding using heritability estimates derived from both SNP-based and twin-based studies. We examine associations between maternal education and three developmental outcomes-child educational achievement, Body Mass Index, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. Polygenic scores explain between 14.3% and 23.0% of the original associations, while analyses under SNP- and twin-based heritability scenarios indicate that observed associations could be almost entirely explained by genetic confounding. Thus, caution is needed when interpreting associations from non-genetically informed epidemiology studies. Our approach, akin to a genetically informed sensitivity analysis can be applied widely. Author summary An objective shared across the life, behavioural, and social sciences is to identify factors that increase risk for a particular disease or trait. However, identifying true risk factors is challenging. Often, a risk factor is statistically associated with a disease even if it is not really relevant, meaning that even successfully improving the risk factor will not impact the disease. One reason for the existence of such misleading associations stems from genetic confounding. This is when genetic factors influence directly both the risk factor and the disease, which generates a statistical association even in the absence of a true effect of the risk factor. Here, we propose a method to estimate genetic confounding and quantify its effect on observed associations. We show that a large part of the associations between maternal education and three child outcomes-educational achievement, body mass index and Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder- is explained by genetic confounding. Our findings can be applied to better understand the role of genetics in explaining associations of key risk factors with diseases and traits.

J	Garner, C				Garner, Chad			Confounded by Sequencing Depth in Association Studies of Rare Alleles	GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						case-control study; next-generation DNA sequencing; false-positive association; genome-wide association	GENETIC-ASSOCIATION; COMMON DISEASES; GENOME; VARIANTS; REGRESSION	Next-generation DNA sequencing technologies are facilitating large-scale association studies of rare genetic variants. The depth of the sequence read coverage is an important experimental variable in the next-generation technologies and it is a major determinant of the quality of genotype calls generated from sequence data. When case and control samples are sequenced separately or in different proportions across batches, they are unlikely to be matched on sequencing read depth and a differential misclassification of genotypes can result, causing confounding and an increased false-positive rate. Data from Pilot Study 3 of the 1000 Genomes project was used to demonstrate that a difference between the mean sequencing read depth of case and control samples can result in false-positive association for rare and uncommon variants, even when the mean coverage depth exceeds 30 x in both groups. The degree of the confounding and inflation in the false-positive rate depended on the extent to which the mean depth was different in the case and control groups. A logistic regression model was used to test for association between case-control status and the cumulative number of alleles in a collapsed set of rare and uncommon variants. Including each individual's mean sequence read depth across the variant sites in the logistic regression model nearly eliminated the confounding effect and the inflated false-positive rate. Furthermore, accounting for the potential error by modeling the probability of the heterozygote genotype calls in the regression analysis had a relatively minor but beneficial effect on the statistical results.

Using an instrumental variable to test for unmeasured confounding	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						instrumental variables; observational study; confounding; comparative effectiveness	TO-TREAT ANALYSIS; CAUSAL INFERENCE; TREATMENT-NONCOMPLIANCE; ACCELERATION; DELIVERY; OUTCOMES; MODELS; CARE	An important concern in an observational study is whether or not there is unmeasured confounding, that is, unmeasured ways in which the treatment and control groups differ before treatment, which affect the outcome. We develop a test of whether there is unmeasured confounding when an instrumental variable (IV) is available. An IV is a variable that is independent of the unmeasured confounding and encourages a subject to take one treatment level versus another, while having no effect on the outcome beyond its encouragement of a certain treatment level. We show what types of unmeasured confounding can be tested for with an IV and develop a test for this type of unmeasured confounding that has correct type I error rate. We show that the widely used Durbin-Wu-Hausman test can have inflated type I error rates when there is treatment effect heterogeneity. Additionally, we show that our test provides more insight into the nature of the unmeasured confounding than the Durbin-Wu-Hausman test. We apply our test to an observational study of the effect of a premature infant being delivered in a high-level neonatal intensive care unit (one with mechanical assisted ventilation and high volume) versus a lower level unit, using the excess travel time a mother lives from the nearest high-level unit to the nearest lower-level unit as an IV.

Variations in prostate biopsy recommendation and acceptance confound evaluation of risk factors for prostate cancer: Examining race and BMI	CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Risk factor; Prevention; Prostate cancer; Differential misclassification	MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; VITAMIN-E; TRIAL; SELENIUM; MEN; FINASTERIDE	Background: Prostate cancer is ubiquitous in older men; differential screening patterns and variations in biopsy recommendations and acceptance will affect which man is diagnosed and, therefore, evaluation of cancer risk factors. We describe a statistical method to reduce prostate cancer detection bias among African American (n = 3398) and Non-Hispanic White men (n = 22,673) who participated in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention trial (SELECT) and revisit a previously reported association between race, obesity and prostate cancer risk. Methods: For men with screening values suggesting prostate cancer but in whom biopsy was not performed, the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial Risk Calculator was used to estimate probability of prostate cancer. Associations of body mass index (BMI) and race with incident prostate cancer were compared for observed versus imputation-enhanced outcomes using incident density ratios. Results: Accounting for differential biopsy assessment, the previously reported positive linear trend between BMI and prostate cancer in African American men was not observed; no BMI association was found among Non-Hispanic White men. Conclusions: Differential disease classification among men who may be recommended to undergo and then consider whether to accept a prostate biopsy leads to inaccurate identification of prostate cancer risk factors. Imputing a man's prostate cancer status reduces detection bias. Covariate adjustment does not address the problem of outcome misclassification. Cohorts evaluating incident prostate cancer should collect longitudinal screening and biopsy data to adjust for this potential bias.

J	Stram, DO; Huberman, M; Wu, AH				Stram, DO; Huberman, M; Wu, AH			Is residual confounding a reasonable explanation for the apparent protective effects of beta-carotene found in epidemiologic studies of lung cancer in smokers?	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						beta carotene; lung neoplasms; measurement error; smoking	SELF-REPORTED SMOKING; BASE-LINE CHARACTERISTICS; CIGARETTE-SMOKING; ALPHA-TOCOPHEROL; CONSUMPTION; NICOTINE; COTININE; RETINOL; PLASMA; MISCLASSIFICATION	The results of three randomized trials of beta-carotene supplementation for the prevention of lung cancer among smokers are in contradiction to a large body of epidemiologic evidence for the reduction of risk of lung cancer among smokers with higher intake and/or higher serum levels of beta-carotene. Complicating this issue are widely noted negative associations between tobacco use and intake or serum levels of beta-carotene. Although observational studies attempt to control for reported smoking histories, the accuracy of self-reported smoking is uncertain; correlations as low as 0.5 between reported and true smoking exposure are not inconsistent with studies of biomarkers of cigarette exposure. The authors developed a simple statistical model for random errors in reported smoking (relative to true tobacco exposure) and assumed a modest (inverse) relation between true tobacco exposure and serum beta-carotene. Calculations from this model, combined with a model for lung cancer contemplated by Doll and Peto (J Epidemiol Community Health 1978;78:303-13), suggest that biases in assessment of smoking exposure between smokers with low versus high beta-carotene intake may plausibly explain much or all of the observed protective effect of high beta-carotene levels. Appropriate cohort studies of lung cancer in smokers, utilizing biomarkers of smoking, are needed and are presently ongoing.

The effect of confounding variables in studies of lead exposure and IQ	CRITICAL REVIEWS IN TOXICOLOGY			English	Review						Blood lead; IQ; pooled-analysis; confounding variables; covariates	LEVEL; INTELLIGENCE	Methods proposed to address confounding variables frequently do not adequately distinguish confounding from covariation. A confounder is a variable that correlates both with the outcome and the major exposure variable. Accurate treatment of confounding is crucial to low dose extrapolation of the effects of chemical exposures based on epidemiology studies. This study explores the limitations of current regression models in extrapolation to the low dose region of the dose-response curve due to the existence of unrecognized and uncontrolled confounding, using epidemiological data for lead. Based on the reported data in analyses by Lanphear and colleagues and Crump and colleagues, and drawing on other studies, Wilson and Wilson considered maternal IQ, HOME score, SES, parental education, birthweight, smoking, and race as characteristic variables which may have interaction effects. This analysis identifies confounding variables based on the seven longitudinal cohorts in analyses conducted by Lanphear and colleagues and by Crump and colleagues and confirms maternal IQ, HOME score, maternal education and maternal marital status at birth are "Highly Likely" confounders, while race is a "Likely" confounder. The cohort data were reanalyzed using the methods presented by Crump and colleagues while also considering the interaction among the identified confounding variables. This analysis determined that confounders influence IQ estimates in a quantifiable way that may exceed or at least obscure previously-reported effects of blood lead on IQ with blood lead levels below 5 mu g/dL; however, limitations in the datasets make predictions of the low dose dose-response analysis questionable.

J	Subramanian, SV; Kawachi, I				Subramanian, SV; Kawachi, I			The association between state income inequality and worse health is not confounded by race	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						income inequality; self-rated health; race; multilevel analysis; US	SELF-RATED HEALTH; MULTILEVEL ANALYSIS; INDIVIDUAL INCOME; LIFE EXPECTANCY; UNITED-STATES; MORTALITY; LEVEL; STORY	Background The relationship between income inequality and health across US states has been challenged recently on grounds that this relationship may be confounded by the effect of racial composition, measured as the proportion of the state's population who are black. Methods Using multilevel statistical models, we examined the association between state income inequality and poor self-rated health. The analysis was based on the pooled 1995 and 1997 Current Population Surveys, comprising 201 221 adults nested within 50 US states. Results Controlling for the individual effects of age, sex, race, marital status, education, income, health insurance coverage, and employment status, we found a significant effect of state income inequality on poor self-rated health. For every 0.05-increase in the Gini coefficient, the odds ratio (OR) of reporting poor health increased by 1.39 (95% CI: 1.26, 1.51). Additionally controlling for the proportion of the state population who are black did not explain away the effect of income inequality (OR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.15, 1.45). While being black at the individual level was associated with poorer self-rated health, no significant relationship was found between poor self-rated health and the proportion of black residents in a state. Conclusion Our finding demonstrates that neither race, at the individual level, nor racial composition, as measured at the state level, explain away the previously reported association between income inequality and poorer health status in the US.

J	le Cessie, S				le Cessie, Saskia			Bias Formulas for Estimating Direct and Indirect Effects When Unmeasured Confounding Is Present	EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article							MEDIATION ANALYSIS; SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS; MEASUREMENT-ERROR; MISCLASSIFICATION	Mediation analysis examines the influence of intermediate factors in the causal pathway between an exposure and an outcome. It yields estimates of the direct effect of the exposure on the outcome and of the indirect effect through the intermediate variable. Both estimates can be biased if the relationship between the mediator and the outcome is confounded. In this article, we study the effect of unmeasured confounding on direct and indirect effect estimates for a continuous mediator and an outcome that may be either binary, count, or continuous. We formulate the effect of the confounder on the intermediate and on the outcome directly in regression models, which makes the formulas intuitive to use by applied users. The formulas are derived under the assumption that the confounder follows a normal distribution. In simulations, the formulas for a linear response model performed well, also as it did when the unmeasured confounder was binary. For a rare binary outcome, the formulas for logistic regression performed well if the unmeasured confounder followed a normal distribution, but for a binary confounder the bias in the direct effect was overcorrected. We applied the formulas to data from a case-control study (Leiden Thrombophilia Study) on risk factors for venous thrombosis. This showed that unmeasured confounding can severely bias the estimates of direct and indirect effects.

Intermediate confounding in trio relationships: The importance of complete data in effect size estimation	GENETIC EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						bias; confounding; maternal effect; paternal effect; trio		We present an important characteristic of trio models which may lead to bias and loss of power when one parent is unmodeled in trio analyses. Motivated by recent interest in estimating parental effects on postnatal and later-life phenotypes, we consider a causal model where each parent has both an effect on their child's phenotype which is mediated through the genotype transmitted to the child and a direct effect on the phenotype through the parentally provided environment. We derive the power and bias of models in which one parent's genotype is not modeled, showing that while the effect of the child's genotype is biased in the direction of the unmodeled parent's effect as expected, the estimated effect of the observed parent's genotype is also biased in the opposite direction. While this phenomenon may not be intuitive under the assumption of random mating, it can be explained by intermediate confounding of the child's genotype-phenotype effect. These observations have implications for the accurate estimation of maternal and paternal effects in trio data sets with missing genotype data.

A Simulation-Based Assessment of Alternative Explanations for Apparent Confounding in "PM Decomposition" Studies	ENVIRONMENTAL MODELING & ASSESSMENT			English	Article						Simulation; Particulate matter; Mortality; Confounding; PM decomposition	PARTICULATE AIR-POLLUTION; EXTENDED FOLLOW-UP; MEASUREMENT ERROR; DAILY MORTALITY; UNITED-STATES; 6 CITIES; EXPOSURE; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PM2.5; PARTICLES	Determining whether there is a causal link between chronic exposure to PM2.5 (atmospheric particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 mu m or less) and mortality is a fundamental challenge in determining appropriate air quality standards for PM2.5. While numerous epidemiological studies have found a statistical association between PM2.5 and mortality, unmeasured confounding in this relationship remains a concern. Several recent studies have examined the possibility of unmeasured confounding of the long-term association between PM2.5 exposure and mortality by decomposing PM2.5 into two orthogonal components - a "global" component that measures the national trend in pollution, and a "local" component that measures the local trend in pollution after controlling for the national trend. Generally, these "PM decomposition" studies find that while PM2.5 and mortality are trending downward over time at the national level, areas with steeper declines in PM2.5 do not have correspondingly steep declines in mortality. This finding is consistent with the long-term relationship between PM2.5 and mortality being confounded by some other, unmeasured, long-term trends. However, alternative explanations for these findings have been proposed under which there is still a causal link between PM2.5 and mortality. This study conducts simulation-based tests of four of these proposed alternative explanations - the omission of spatial variation in PM2.5 and mortality, confounding at the local level, measurement error, and an association between PM(2.5 )and mortality at a different time scale than those tested in the PM decomposition studies. We find that none of these alternative explanations can reproduce the results in the PM decomposition studies while simultaneously allowing for a causal link between PM2.5 and mortality.

Their joint effects are less well understood. Methods: We explored the role of air pollution in modifying the effects of heat waves on mortality, within the EuroHEAT project. Daily mortality, meteorologic, and air pollution data from nine European cities for the years 1990-2004 were assembled. We defined heat waves by taking both intensity and duration into account. The city-specific effects of heat wave episodes were estimated using generalized estimating equation models, adjusting for potential confounders with and without inclusion of air pollutants (particles, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide). To investigate effect modification, we introduced an interaction term between heat waves and each single pollutant in the models. Random effects meta-analysis was used to summarize the city-specific results. Results: The increase in the number of daily deaths during heat wave episodes was 54% higher on high ozone days compared with low, among people age 75-84 years. The heat wave effect on high PM10 days was increased by 36% and 106% in the 75-84 year and 85+ year age groups, respectively. A similar pattern was observed for effects on cardiovascular mortality. Effect modification was less evident for respiratory mortality, although the heat wave effect itself was greater for this cause of death. The heat wave effect was smaller (15-30%) after adjustment for ozone or PM10. Conclusions: The heat wave effect on mortality was larger during high ozone or high PM10 days. When assessing the effect of heat waves on mortality, lack of adjustment for ozone and especially PM10 overestimates effect parameters. This bias has implications for public health policy.

Study Design and Setting: Interrupted time series design was applied to study the prevalence of statin use in Dutch diabetes patients over the period 1998-2011. Effects of guideline changes on the outcome were estimated using a Poisson regression model with and without the birth cohort dimension modeled through random intercepts. Results: Both models estimated a stronger increase in prevalence of statin use after influential studies were published in 2003 for patients aged below 50 and above 70 years. The model that controlled for birth cohort also estimated an effect for patients aged 50-70 years from 2003 onward. The magnitude of the intervention effect for patients aged above 70 years when we controlled for birth cohort was reduced from 0.078 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.065, 0.091] to 0.027 (95% CI: 0.013, 0.041). Similarly, for patients aged below 50 years, the estimated guideline effect was reduced from 0.070 (95% CI: 0.048, 0.092) to 0.055 (95% CI: 0.035, 0.075). Conclusion: In this case study, the birth cohort dimension appeared to confound population-level effect estimates of guideline changes on prevalence of statin use in patients with diabetes.

A sensitivity analysis using information about measured confounders yielded improved uncertainty assessments for unmeasured confounding	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						unmeasured confounding; bias; observational studies; sensitivity analysis; Bayesian statistics; pharmacoepidemiology	HEART-FAILURE; MORTALITY; BIAS; ADJUSTMENT; BLOCKERS; DATABASE	Objective: In the analysis of observational data, the argument is sometimes made that if adjustment for measured confounders induces little change in the treatment-outcome association, then there is less concern about the extent to which the association is driven by unmeasured confounding. We quantify this reasoning using Bayesian sensitivity analysis (BSA) for unmeasured confounding. Using hierarchical models, the confounding effect of a binary unmeasured variable is modeled as arising from the same distribution as that of measured confounders. Our objective is to investigate the performance of the method compared to sensitivity analysis, which assumes that there is no relationship between measured and unmeasured confounders. Study Design and Setting: We apply the method in an observational study of the effectiveness of beta-blocker therapy in heart failure patients. Results: BSA for unmeasured confounding using hierarchical prior distributions yields an odds ratio (OR) of 0.72, 95% credible interval (CrI): 0.56, 0.93 for the association between beta-blockers and mortality, whereas using independent priors yields OR = 0.72, 95% CrI: 0.45, 1.15. Conclusion: If the confounding effect of a binary unmeasured variable is similar to that of measured confounders, then conventional sensitivity analysis may give results that overstate the uncertainty about bias.

Intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired bacteraemia and ICU mortality and discharge: addressing time-varying confounding using appropriate methodology	JOURNAL OF HOSPITAL INFECTION			English	Article						Burden; Intensive care units; Bacteraemia; Inverse probability weighting; Bias	BLOOD-STREAM INFECTIONS; MARGINAL STRUCTURAL MODELS; ATTRIBUTABLE MORTALITY; NOSOCOMIAL INFECTIONS; MULTISTATE MODELS; RISK-FACTORS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; POPULATION	Background: Studies often ignore time-varying confounding or may use inappropriate methodology to adjust for time-varying confounding. Aim: To estimate the effect of intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired bacteraemia on ICU mortality and discharge using appropriate methodology. Methods: Marginal structural models with inverse probability weighting were used to estimate the ICU mortality and discharge associated with ICU-acquired bacteraemia among patients who stayed more than two days at the general ICU of a London teaching hospital and remained bacteraemia-free during those first two days. For comparison, the same associations were evaluated with (i) a conventional Cox model, adjusting only for baseline confounders and (ii) a Cox model adjusting for baseline and time-varying confounders. Findings: Using the marginal structural model with inverse probability weighting, bacteraemia was associated with an increase in ICU mortality (cause-specific hazard ratio (CSHR): 1.29; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02-1.63)and a decrease in discharge (CSHR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.45-0.60). By 60 days, among patients still in the ICU after two days and without prior bacteraemia, 8.0% of ICU deaths could be prevented by preventing all ICU-acquired bacteraemia cases. The conventional Cox model adjusting for time-varying confounders gave substantially different results [for ICU mortality, CSHR: 1.08 (95% CI: 0.88-1.32); for discharge, CSHR: 0.68 (95% CI: 0.60-0.77)].

We used daily measurements for particulate matter less than 10 mum in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) and/or black smoke from 29 European cities. We considered confounding from other pollutants as well as meteorologic and chronologic variables. We investigated several variables describing the cities' pollution, climate, population, and geography as potential effect modifiers. For the individual city analysis, generalized additive models extending Poisson regression, using a smoother to control for seasonal patterns, were applied. To provide quantitative summaries of the results and explain remaining heterogeneity, we applied second-stage regression models. The estimated increase in the daily number of deaths for all ages for a 10 mug/m(3) increase in daily PM10 or black smoke concentrations was 0.6% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.4-0.8%], whereas for the elderly it was slightly higher. We found important effect modification for several of the variables studied. Thus, in a city with low average NO2, the estimated increase in daily mortality for an increase of 10 mug/m(3) in PM10 was 0.19 (95% CI = 0.00-0.41), whereas in a city with high average NO2 it was 0.80% (95% CI = 0.67-0.93%); in a relatively cold climate the corresponding effect was 0.29% (95% CI = 0.16-0.42), whereas in a warm climate it was 0.82% (95% CI = 0.69-0.96); in a city with low standardized mortality rate it was 0.80% (95% CI = 0.65-0.95%), and in one with a high rate it was 0.43% (95% CI = 0.24-0.62). Our results confirm those previously reported on the effects of ambient particles on mortality. Furthermore, they show that the heterogeneity found in the effect parameters among cities reflects real effect modification, which is explained by specific city characteristics.

Adjusting for confounding by indication in observational studies: a case study in traumatic brain injury	CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						confounding; observational studies; traumatic brain injury; instrumental variable analysis; comparative effectiveness research	ACUTE SUBDURAL-HEMATOMA; PROPENSITY SCORE; HEAD-INJURY; MORTALITY; MANAGEMENT; CARE; BIAS; CLASSIFICATION; HEMORRHAGE; GUIDELINES	Introduction: Observational studies of interventions are at risk for confounding by indication. The objective of the current study was to define the circumstances for the validity of methods to adjust for confounding by indication in observational studies. Patients and methods: We performed post hoc analyses of data prospectively collected from three European and North American traumatic brain injury studies including 1,725 patients. The effects of three interventions (intracranial pressure [ICP] monitoring, intracranial operation and primary referral) were estimated in a proportional odds regression model with the Glasgow Outcome Scale as ordinal outcome variable. Three analytical methods were compared: classical covariate adjustment, propensity score matching and instrumental variable (IV) analysis in which the percentage exposed to an intervention in each hospital was added as an independent variable, together with a random intercept for each hospital. In addition, a simulation study was performed in which the effect of a hypothetical beneficial intervention (OR 1.65) was simulated for scenarios with and without unmeasured confounders. Results: For all three interventions, covariate adjustment and propensity score matching resulted in negative estimates of the treatment effect (OR ranging from 0.80 to 0.92), whereas the IV approach indicated that both ICP monitoring and intracranial operation might be beneficial (OR per 10% change 1.17, 95% CI 1.01-1.42 and 1.42, 95% CI 0.95-1.97). In our simulation study, we found that covariate adjustment and propensity score matching resulted in an invalid estimate of the treatment effect in case of unmeasured confounders (OR ranging from 0.90 to 1.03). The IV approach provided an estimate in the similar direction as the simulated effect (OR per 10% change 1.04-1.05) but was statistically inefficient. Conclusion: The effect estimation of interventions in observational studies strongly depends on the analytical method used. When unobserved confounding and practice variation are expected in observational multicenter studies, IV analysis should be considered.

Method - Standardised morbidity ratios were calculated for cancers in Great Britain for 1981 and standardised mortality ratios for all cause mortality in Great Britain between 1982 and 1985. Deprivation indices were calculated for enumeration districts and wards from 1981 small area census statistics. Cancers and deaths were allocated to enumeration districts via their postcode. Standardised morbidity and mortality ratios were calculated by quintile of enumeration district according to the deprivation index. Standardised mortality ratios were further analysed by deprivation of ward, region, and urban/rural status. Results - Strong relationships were found between all cause mortality and the incidence of selected cancers and deprivation quintile - there was up to a twofold difference in lung cancer incidence between the highest and lowest quintile. The deprivation index can be used to measure gradients of deprivation according to the distance from industrial sites. The deprivation index for enumeration districts showed similar discrimination of mortality as the index for wards. There is some interaction between deprivation and region in their effect on the standardised mortality ratios, leading to a small bias in the estimation of expected numbers if this is not taken into account. The relationship between deprivation, urban/rural status, and mortality is complex and confounded by region, but mortality tends to be higher in urban than in rural areas within quintiles of deprivation. Discussion - Whether calculated for enumeration districts or wards, the main problems in the interpretation of the deprivation index may be its limited correlation with the risk factors of interest and its concentration on present rather than past socioeconomic status. Indirect standardisation based on stratification for deprivation and other variables involves a trade off between bias and precision in determining the fineness and the number of axes of stratification. Some bias may occur due to interaction between region and deprivation and the effects of urban/rural status. Complementary approaches including modelling and proportional mortality or morbidity analyses may be needed and the possibility of residual socioeconomic confounding must always be considered. Conclusion - There is potential for important socioeconomic confounding in small area studies of environmental pollution and health where the health outcome under examination has a strong relationship to socioeconomic status and where the putative excess risk due to pollution may be small. One method of controlling for confounding is to use an ecological measurement of deprivation in small areas, and to adjust for deprivation by indirect standardisation. However, residual socioeconomic confounding can be expected, which may seriously complicate the interpretation of small area studies.

Birthweight, gestational age and familial confounding in sex differences in infant mortality: a matched co-twin control study of Brazilian male-female twin pairs identified by population data linkage	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Twins; infant; neonatal; mortality; sex differences; birthweight; familial confounding; gestational age; data linkage; administrative data	NEONATAL-MORTALITY; MODELS; LENGTH	Background In infancy, males are at higher risk of dying than females. Birthweight and gestational age are potential confounders or mediators but are also familial and correlated, posing epidemiological challenges that can be addressed by studying male-female twin pairs. Methods We studied 28 558 male-female twin pairs born in Brazil between 2012 and 2016, by linking their birth and death records. Using a co-twin control study matched for gestational age and familial factors, we applied logistic regression with random effects (to account for paired data) to study the association between male sex and infant death, adjusting for: birthweight, within- and between-pair effects of birthweight, birth order and gestational age, including interactions. The main outcome was infant mortality (0-365 days) stratified by neonatal (early and late) and postneonatal deaths. Results Males were 100 g heavier and more at risk of infant death than their female co-twins before [odds ratio (OR) = 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11-1.49, P = 0.001] and after (OR = 1.60, 95% CI: 1.39-1.83, P <0.001) adjusting for birthweight and birth order. When adjusting for birthweight within-pair difference and mean separately, the OR attenuated to 1.40 (95% CI: 1.21-1.61, P <0.001), with evidence of familial confounding (likelihood ratio test, P <0.001). We found evidence of interaction (P = 0.001) between male sex and gestational age for early neonatal death. Conclusions After matching for gestational age and familial factors by design and controlling for birthweight and birth order, males remain at greater risk of infant death than their female co-twins. Birthweight's role as a confounder can be partially explained by familial factors.
